Abstract
Inherited retinal diseases (IRD) are a leading cause of blindness in the working age population. 
The advances in ocular genetics, retinal imaging and molecular biology, have conspired to create 
the ideal environment for establishing treatments for IRD, with the first approved gene therapy and 
the commencement of multiple therapy trials. The scope of this review is to familiarize clinicians 
and scientists with the current landscape of retinal imaging in IRD. Herein we present in a 
comprehensive and concise manner the imaging findings of: (I) macular dystrophies (MD) 
[Stargardt disease ( ABCA4 ), X-linked retinoschisis ( RS1), Best disease ( BEST1 ), pattern 
dystrophy ( PRPH2 ), Sorsby fundus dystrophy ( TIMP3 ), and autosomal dominant drusen 
(EFEMP1 )], (II) cone and cone-rod dystrophies ( GUCA1A , PRPH2 , ABCA4  and RPGR ), (III) 
cone dysfunction syndromes [achromatopsia ( CNGA3, CNGB3, PDE6C, PDE6H, GNAT2, 
ATF6 ], blue-cone monochromatism ( OPN1LW/OPN1MW  array), oligocone trichromacy, 
bradyopsia ( RGS9/R9AP ) and Bornholm eye disease ( OPN1LW/OPN1MW ), (IV) Leber 
congenital amaurosis ( GUCY2D , CEP290 , CRB1 , RDH12 , RPE65, TULP1 , AIPL1  and 
NMNAT1 ), (V) rod-cone dystrophies [retinitis pigmentosa, enhanced S-Cone syndrome ( NR2E3 ), 
Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy ( CYP4V2 )], (VI) rod dysfunction syndromes (congenital 
stationary night blindness, fundus albipunctatus ( RDH5 ), Oguchi disease ( SAG , GRK1 ), and (VII) 
chorioretinal dystrophies [choroideremia ( CHM ), gyrate atrophy ( OAT )].

Introduction
The inherited retinal diseases (IRD) have heterogeneous clinical presentation, which can 
result in diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis commonly involved multimodal retinal imaging, as 
well as psychophysical and electrophysiological evaluation. They constitute the leading 
cause of legal blindness in England and Wales amongst working-age adults, and the second 
commonest in childhood ( 1), having a great impact on the individuals and families affected 
(2), and they are subject to a range of interventions and research avenues ( 3). Here, we 
categorise IRD on the basis of the primarily affected retinal cell-type and disease natural 
history (stationary or progressive). We prioritised the selected conditions based on: (I) their 
prevalence, (II) ongoing trial(s) of novel therapeutics, and (III) distinctive imaging findings.
Macular dystrophies (MD)
MD are a group of IRD characterised by bilateral, relatively symmetrical macular 
abnormalities that significantly impair central visual function ( 4). Below we present the 
imaging findings of the commonest subtypes ( 5), including Stargardt disease (STGD), Best 
disease (BD), X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), pattern 
dystrophy (PD), and autosomal dominant drusen (ADD).
Stargardt disease
STGD ( ABCA4 , OMIM 601691) is the most common MD. The most common presentation 
is a widespread deposition of lipofuscin (bisretinoids) in the retinal pigment epithelium 
(RPE), leading to the classical fundus appearance of retinal flecks. The spectrum of disease 
is highly variable, ranging from generalised cone and rod system involvement (COD/CORD 
ABCA4 disease is presented in the next section) to isolated macular disease (Figure 1A) ( 6–
11). Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) demonstrates a dark choroidal phase due to 
masking from lipofuscin deposition in the RPE; but has been superseded by optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF). A characteristic pattern 
of areas of increased and decreased signal on FAF imaging is seen in STGD. FAF imaging 
may serve as a monitoring tool, and decreased autofluorescence area measurements can be 
used as a structural outcome for interventional clinical trials ( 12,13). The peripheral fundus 
FAF findings and the classification of the posterior pole appearance can be achieved with 
Ultra-wide field FAF (UWF-FAF) ( 14–17).
OCT sensitively quantifies RPE atrophy and the severity and extent of outer retinal loss 
(photoreceptor loss). Moreover, it can identify asymptomatic childhood-onset STGD, by 
demonstrating hyperreflectivity at the base of the foveal outer nuclear layer ( 6). The 
anatomical level of the retinal flecks can be demonstrated and can be correlated with visual 
function ( 9,10,18–22). The earliest structural changes of the disease are juxtafoveal and Georgiou et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptappear to spare the foveola ( 6). Photoreceptor loss is likely to precede RPE degeneration; 
both of which contribute to choriocapillaris loss ( 23,24). In vivo  cellular imaging using 
adaptive optics (AO), proved reduced cone densities and increased photoreceptor spacing 
(25,26). The cones can be reliably counted, and tracked over time ( 27).
BD
BD ( BEST1 , OMIM 607854) is the second most common MD and is an autosomal 
dominant condition, due to disease-causing variants in BEST1  (28). Early stage (Stage 1) 
disease is characterised by a normal fundus or minimal RPE changes (pre-vitelliform). The 
classical appearance of BD is the single, bilateral symmetrical egg-yolk-like (vitelliform) 
lesion at the fovea (Stage 2). Over time, this lesion can start to undergo resorption, 
progressing to a ‘pseudohypopyon’ (Stage 3). The subretinal yellow material gravitates 
inferiorly within the lesion. Stage 1 and 2 are associated with normal visual acuity (V A), and 
patients can be identified during a family survey or co-incidentally. V A reduction is observed 
from stage 3 onwards. Further breakdown of subretinal material can result in a ‘vitelliruptive 
stage’ (Stage 4). End-stage disease (Stage 5) is characterised by either sub-RPE fibrosis 
(29), atrophy, or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Despite the classification of the 
fundus appearance into stages, there is rarely predictable progression from one to the other.
The subretinal vitelliform lesion presents with a high signal on FAF imaging and it is best 
visualized with OCT (Figure 1B) ( 30). A common finding is subretinal fluid (SRF) which 
waxes and wanes over time. Inherited causes of vitelliform lesion can be distinguished from 
non-inherited acquired disorders due to the increased signal on FAF. The fibrosis that can 
occur in advanced BD has been described as resembling a “circus tent” due to its 
exaggerated height and unusual height-to-base ratio ( 31). OCTA has suggested this fibrosis 
to have a neovascular origin ( 32). Fibrotic lesions appear hypoautofluorescent on FAF. 
OCTA is particularly useful in identifying CNV in vitelliform disorders including BD, 
where FFA can be very challenging to interpret ( 4).
XLRS
XLRS ( RS1, OMIM 312700) is the most common form of juvenile-onset retinal 
degeneration in males ( 4). The hallmark feature of XLRS is the “spoke-wheel” folds of the 
macula (macular schisis) (Figure 1C). Peripheral retinal changes are observed in 
approximately 50% of males, including, schisis (with inner or outer retinal holes), 
pigmentary disturbance, white spiculations, metallic sheen, neovascularisation and vitreous 
veils. An increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD), or vitreous 
haemorrhage (VH) has been reported for patients with peripheral retinoschisis ( 33). Bullous 
XLRS can be congenital or develop soon after birth, and it can be complicated later in life 
by RD, which may be rhegmatogenous, tractional or a Coats-like exudative detachment ( 34). 
The development of macular atrophy may lead to slow V A loss in older adults.
The identification of macular schisis can be challenging on clinical examination, making 
multimodal imaging invaluable. Splitting of the inner and outer retinal layers can be readily 
identified with OCT, and a spoke-wheel appearance of concentric areas of high- and low-
signal intensity is observed with FAF imaging (Figure 1C). Rarely macular OCT can be Georgiou et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptnormal/near normal, and peripheral changes are then the only clue to the clinical diagnosis. 
Ultra-wide field imaging with FFA and OCTA can be helpful identifying less common 
vascular abnormalities such as vascular sheathing and neovascularization ( 35). Increased and 
irregular cone spacing within the foveal schisis is reported with AO imaging. However, the 
presence of preserved wave-guiding cones at the fovea and macular regions may indicate a 
good potential for successful rescue with intervention ( 23,36).
Sorsby fundus dystrophy
SFD ( TIMP3 , OMIM 188826) is a rare ADD-associated MD. FAF imaging may identify a 
broad ill-defined increase in signal in the peripheral macula in early disease, with subretinal 
drusenoid deposits - reticular pseudodrusen, that spare the central fovea, clearly depicted on 
infra-red imaging (Figure 1D). OCT can identify drusen-like deposits and delineate Bruch 
membrane thickening; and is valuable in the diagnosis of CNV . Early CNV changes can be 
captured with OCTA, without the need for FFA ( 37).
PD
PD (PRPH2 , OMIM 179605) is characterized by variable distributions of pigment 
deposition at the level of the RPE. The deposits in PD are typically hyperautofluorescent on 
FAF, and may result in a characteristic speckled pattern ( 38). As these changes are at the 
level of RPE, subretinal hyper-reflective material is seen on OCT (Figure 1E).
ADD
ADD ( EFEMP1 , OMIM 601548) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by 
drusen-like deposits at the macula, which may be in a radiating ( Malattia leventinese ) or 
honeycomb-like appearance [Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (MIM126600)]. The 
drusen-like deposits in ADD are hyperautofluorescent on FAF, in contrast to drusen in AMD 
which are variable on FAF ( 39,40). Drusen-like deposits are seen as hyper-reflective 
thickening of the RPE-Bruch membrane complex ( 41), with disrupted photoreceptor 
integrity on OCT (Figure 1F) ( 42). CNV in ADD can be diagnosed with OCTA ( 43).
Cone and cone-rod dystrophies
Progressive COD/CORD are characterised by cone photoreceptor degeneration, which may 
be followed by subsequent rod photoreceptor loss. These disorders typically present with 
progressive loss of central vision, colour vision disturbance and photophobia ( 11,44). We 
discuss their retinal imaging, focusing on five of the most common genotypes: GUCA1A , 
GUCY2D , ABCA4 , PRPH2  and RPGR .
Autosomal dominant GUCA1A-associated COD/CORD
GUCA1A  COD/CORD (OMIM 600364) has variable fundoscopy findings, ranging from 
mild RPE disturbance to extensive macular atrophy (Figure 2A). FAF is useful in 
investigating macular abnormalities, although both areas of hypoautofluorescence and 
hyperautofluorescence have correlated with retinal atrophy; an increased signal at the fovea 
may be seen in early disease ( 45–47). Cellular variability between patients harbouring the 
same variant is identified with AOSLO ( 48).Georgiou et al. Page 4
Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 April 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAutosomal dominant GUCY2D-associated COD/CORD
GUCY2D  (OMIM 600179) variants can cause both COD, CORD, and Leber congenital 
amaurosis (LCA) ( 49,50). GUCY2D -associated COD/CORD is AD disease, in contrast to 
LCA which is recessive ( 51). Fundoscopy findings are varied, ranging from mild RPE 
changes to extensive macular atrophy, observed in older individuals ( 52,53). FAF imaging 
usually shows central hypoautofluorescence and a surrounding ring of 
hyperautofluorescence (Figure 2B) ( 53). A variable degree of EZ disruption over the fovea 
can be observed, as well as macular thinning ( 54).
Autosomal dominant PRPH2-associated CORD
PRPH2  COD/CORD (OMIM 179605) fundoscopic appearance ranges from a bull’s-eye 
maculopathy to macular atrophy. A characteristic speckled macular appearance on FAF is 
demonstrated in most of the patients (Figure 2C) ( 55). AOSLO imaging in p.(Arg172Trp)-
associated CORD revealed increased cone spacing throughout the macula with 
corresponding loss of outer retinal structures on OCT ( 56). However, intrafamilial analysis 
of p.(Arg172Gln)-associated disease has shown marked variability, similar to that seen in 
GUCA1A -associated CORD; whilst one family member had a completely normal 
photoreceptor mosaic, two others had variable parafoveal cone loss ( 57).
Autosomal recessive ABCA4-associated COD/CORD
ABCA4  COD/CORD (OMIM 601691), fundoscopy may initially reveal a normal fundus or 
mild retinal abnormalities (such as loss of foveal reflex), whereas peripheral degenerative 
changes occur in later disease ( 58). Diagnosis can therefore be delayed unless FAF or OCT 
imaging is undertaken ( 8). FAF findings include a bull’s-eye maculopathy-like appearance 
with yellow-white retinal flecks and increasing macular atrophy over time ( 59,60); whilst 
OCT reveals loss of outer retinal architecture at the central macula ( 24). Longitudinal 
increase in abnormal AF regions correlates with both visual function decline and abnormal 
cone spacing on AOSLO ( 61). However, cone mosaic abnormalities are known to precede 
abnormal psychophysical testing and FAF ( 25).
X-Linked RPGR-associated COD/CORD
Most disease-causing variants in RPGR  (OMIM 312610) result in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) 
(62), but those leading to COD/CORD are preferentially sequestered at the 3’ end of the 
ORF15 region ( 63). FAF imaging often reveals parafoveal rings of increased signal in 
RPGR -associated COD/CORD (Figure 2D). Unlike RP, these increase in size with disease 
progression and are inversely related to ERG amplitude ( 64,65).
Cone dysfunction syndromes (CDS)
The CDS are stationary cone disorders, with congenital/early-infantile onset and give rise to 
purely cone dysfunction, whereas the aforementioned progressive cone dystrophies are of 
later-onset and usually also involve rod loss over time ( 66). CDS are rarer than COD/CORD, 
with only 10 genes implicated and only five distinct phenotypes described to date; 
achromatopsia (ACHM), blue-cone monochromatism (BCM), oligocone trichromacy (OT), Georgiou et al. Page 5
Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 April 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptbradyopsia and Bornholm eye disease (BED). Retinal imaging of all these conditions will be 
described.
ACHM
ACHM is the most common CDS. Disease-causing variants have been reported in CNGA3 
(67,68) (OMIM600053), CNGB3  (69) (OMIM605080), GNAT2  (70,71) (OMIM139340), 
ATF6  (72) (OMIM605537), PDE6H  (73) (OMIM601190) and PDE6C  (66) (OMIM600827). 
It presents either at birth or early infancy, with poor V A, pendular nystagmus, photophobia, 
and color vision loss along all three axes ( 74).
Four distinct FAF phenotypes have been reported: (I) normal appearance (Figure 3A), (II) 
central increased signal (Figure 3B), (III) reduced signal centrally (Figure 3C) ( 75), and (IV) 
central area of decreased signal (Figure 3D), with a surrounding ring of 
hyperautofluorescence ( 76). OCT imaging can be used to grade ACHM into five grades: (I) 
Continuous ellipsoid zone (EZ) (Figure 3E), (II) EZ disruption (Figure 3F), (III) EZ absence 
(Figure 3G), (IV) presence of a hyporeflective zone (Figure 3H), and (V) outer retinal 
atrophy with RPE loss (Figure 3I) ( 77). In CNGA3  and CNGB3  genotypes, all these grades 
have been observed (with approximately 50% cases being grade I to III); suggesting residual 
cones in a good proportion of patients. The presence of residual cones is critical for targeting 
by gene therapy intervention ( 78,79). In contrast for PDE6C -ACHM and ATF6 -ACHM, no 
patients have been reported with grades I-II. GNAT2 -ACHM typically presents with grade I 
(80). OCT findings support that the condition in predominantly stable in the vast majority of 
patients ( 81). In contrast, PDE6C -ACHM can be slowly progressive ( 76). Foveal hypoplasia, 
preservation of inner retinal layers over the fovea, is a common OCT finding in ACHM; 
being present in all subjects with ATF6 -ACHM (Figure 3G) ( 76,82), in 60–70% of 
previously reported patients with CNGA3 - and CNGB3 -ACHM (Figure 3F) ( 77,78,83–85), 
and is not present in any reported subject with GNAT2 - and PDE6C -ACHM.
ACHM is by far the most well-studied condition using AOSLO imaging ( 23). Marked 
variability in the cone mosaic has been observed across patients; with no significant 
difference between the two most common genotypes, CNGA3  and CNGB3  (77,83,86), and 
the rarer GNAT2  genotype associated with the least disrupted photoreceptor mosaic 
(80,87,88). In a large cohort of CNGB3 -ACHM, significantly decreased peak foveal cone 
densities and increased spacing has been reported ( 78). Similar findings were also reported 
for CNGA3 -ACHM (n=38), also including a high degree of interocular symmetry, and vast 
intrafamilial variability ( 79). In ATF6 - and PDE6C -associated ACHM, AOSLO studies 
identified few if any cellular residual structures ( 76,82).
Gene therapy trials for CNGA3 - and CNGB3 -associated ACHM are on-going.
Blue cone monochromatism
BCM is an X-linked condition characterized by defects of L- and M-wavelength-sensitive 
cone function (OMIM 300821, 300822, 300824), with a fundus examination revealing a 
myopic but otherwise normal retina ( 66,89). Presenting symptoms, OCT and FAF imaging 
can be similar to ACHM, with a variable degree of EZ disruption (Figure 3J) ( 90). In 
AOSLO imaging, cone mosaic disruption is highly variable and may be genotype specific Georgiou et al. Page 6
Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 April 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript(23,91) The cone mosaic appears dark over the foveal centre with confocal AOSLO, with a 
sparse array of large bright spots, which are believed to be S-cones, surrounding it ( 91,92). 
Cone density is higher than that expected for the S-cone sub-mosaic, in keeping with 
remnant L-/M-cones ( 93–95). Overall, these AOSLO imaging studies have identified 
significant inter-subject variability ( 23). Despite female carriers being asymptomatic, 
confocal AOSLO has demonstrated variably reduced cone density, increased spacing, and 
disrupted organisation, with phenotypic variability likely relating to random X-chromosome 
inactivation ( 96).
BED
BED (OMIM 300821, 300822) is an X-linked CDS associated with dichromacy and myopia, 
decreased V A, RPE thinning, and visible choroidal vessels in the posterior pole ( 66,97). 
Retinal thinning can be observed on OCT (Figure 3K) ( 98). AOSLO imaging shows 
evidence that patients with BED have a significantly disrupted cone mosaic ( 23,98–100).
OT
The disease hallmark is the reduced amplitude of cone responses on ERG, with normal or 
near-normal color discrimination, and normal fundus appearance ( 66,101). On OCT imaging 
the outer segment length appears reduced, with decreased intensity of the EZ outside the 
fovea ( 102). The cone photoreceptor mosaic in OT has been investigated with an AO fundus 
camera, and in keeping with the original disease mechanism hypothesis, a decreased number 
(‘oligocone’) of otherwise normal appearing foveal cones (thereby permitting ‘trichromacy’) 
was observed ( 102).
RGS9/R9AP-associated retinopathy (‘Bradyopsia’)
RGS9/R9AP -associated retinopathy (OMIM 604067, 607814) presents from early childhood 
with delayed dark and light adaption ( 103), which can be a common feature also in OT 
(102), as well as other findings such as a normal fundus appearance, reduced V A, and 
normal color vision ( 104–107). OCT and FAF are usually normal (Figure 3L) ( 107). Unlike 
in OT, confocal AOSLO has revealed a normal cone photoreceptor mosaic in subjects with 
RGS9/R9AP -associated retinopathy ( 102,108). Cellular phenotyping is therefore able to 
differentiate between these two conditions with common clinical features—an intact 
photoreceptor mosaic in RGS9/R9AP -associated retinopathy, and disruption in OT ( 23).
LCA/EOSRD
LCA/EOSRD are both genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, and characterised 
clinically by severe congenital/early infancy visual loss, nystagmus, amaurotic pupils and 
markedly reduced/absent full-field electroretinograms ( 109). The identified genes account 
for approximately 70–80%. GUCY2D , CEP290 , CRB1 , RDH12  and RPE65  are the most 
common and their imaging findings are presented below, together with TULP1 , AIPL1  and 
NMNAT1  due to distinctive findings are also presented.Georgiou et al. Page 7
Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 April 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptGUCY2D - LCA/EOSRD
Patients with GUCY2D  - LCA/EOSRD (OMIM 600179) often have relatively normal fundi, 
in contrast to most other LCA/EOSRD genotypes ( 51). There can be relatively preserved 
outer retinal structure on OCT in many patients (even lifelong, Figure 4A), although foveal 
cone outer segment abnormalities and foveal cone loss has been observed ( 51,110). FAF 
findings are variable; normal, central foveal hyperautofluorescence, and/or a perimacular 
ring of increased AF have been reported (Figure 4A) ( 51). A phase I/II gene therapy trial is 
on-going.
CEP290 - LCA/EOSRD
OCT studies of CEP290  - LCA/EOSRD (OMIM 610142) have shown that despite profound 
cone dysfunction, the foveal architecture is structurally preserved until the fourth decade of 
life in some patients; although with abnormal inner and outer segments in contrast to the 
early loss of rod photoreceptors ( 110,111). FAF imaging reveals a perifoveal 
hyperautofluorescent ring in most patients (Figure 4B), and areas of decreased signal in 
older patients (pigmentary retinopathy) ( 111). Phase I/II and Phase III gene therapy trials are 
on-going.
CRB1 - LCA/EOSRD
CRB1 -associated disease (OMIM 604210) has nummular pigmentation, maculopathy, 
relative preservation of para-arteriolar RPE, intraretinal cystoid spaces, with retinal 
thickening and loss of lamination on OCT (Figure 4C) ( 112). Not all findings are present in 
all patients. Altered retinal lamination with increased RNFL thickness; is a rather unique 
finding for CRB1  compared to other LCA/EOSRD genotypes ( 113). CRB1  variants can be 
associated with a range of phenotypes and corresponding retinal imaging findings; including 
RP (114), Coats-like vasculopathy, and maculopathy ( 115).
RDH12 - LCA/EOSRD
RDH12 -associated disease (OMIM 608830), which gives rise to an EOSRD phenotype is 
characterised by early-dense intraretinal pigment migration and maculopathy ( 116). OCT 
reveals severe loss of structure often from 10 years of age ( 117). Macular atrophy is a 
universal finding on FAF (centrally decreased signal), and with disease progression, the area 
of atrophy extends peripherally in a variegated watercolour-like pattern (Figure 4D), which 
usually corresponds to the retinal vasculature ( 117). Recently the phenotypic spectrum of 
RDH12  has been extended to include later onset and milder phenotypes ( 118).
RPE65 - LCA/EOSRD
RPE65 -deficiency (OMIM 180069) is associated with reduced or absent AF on FAF 
imaging, suggesting low or absent levels of lipofuscin in the RPE (Figure 4E) ( 119,120). 
OCT studies have demonstrated relatively normal retinal thickness in some patients; with 
more commonly a central macular area of relatively preserved retina with a surrounding ring 
of thinning or more widespread retinal loss (Figure 4E) ( 120,121). There is an FDA- and 
EMA-approved gene therapy for RPE65 -EOSRD.Georgiou et al. Page 8
Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 April 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTULP1, AIPL1 and NMNAT1 - LCA
TULP1  (OMIM 602280), AIPL1  (OMIM 604323) and NMNAT1  (OMIM 608700)-
associated disease are characterised by early maculopathy. NMNAT1  maculopathy typically 
is severe, early onset and extensive (Figure 4F), with pigment clumping (including 
nummular pigmentation), both visible on FAF and OCT ( 122). Similar to RDH12 , the 
phenotypic spectrum of NMNAT1  has been extended to later onset and a milder phenotype 
(123). In AIPL1 -LCA no patient is identified in the literature with residual outer retinal 
structure beyond the age 4 ( 110,124). A gene therapy study is on-going for AIPL1 -LCA.
Rod-cone dystrophies
Rod-cone dystrophies are a variable group of inherited retinal conditions, both in terms of 
phenotype and genotype ( 125), with a prevalence of 1/3,000–1/4,000 in the general 
population ( 126). Herein we present the imaging findings of RP, enhanced S-Cone syndrome 
(ESCS) and Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy (BCD).
RP
RP is characterized by nyctalopia and gradual constriction of the visual field, with eventual 
loss of central vision, progressing to legal blindness ( 127,128). RP can be inherited as an 
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive (AR) or X linked trait. Due to the large number of 
genes involved (>100 genes) and the lack of distinct/specific genotype-phenotype 
correlations, an overview of retinal imaging will be presented for RP and not each specific 
genotype.
Areas of atrophied RPE/photoreceptor cell loss have decreased AF because of the lack of 
lipofuscin, and are observed to a greater extent in the mid-periphery (Figure 5A). Wide-field 
FAF can better evaluate the full extent of peripheral atrophy in RP. Increased AF is often 
observed in the form of a concentric ring around the macula ( 65), and represents areas of 
dysfunction/degenerating photoreceptors ( 129). The hyperautofluorescent ring demarcates 
the area of central viable retina from the surrounding atrophic retina, and thereby is observed 
to constrict over time (in contrast to CORD, where it is seen to expand) ( 65). The ring size 
and width follows an exponential decline, with faster loss of area earlier in the disease 
(65,130). X-linked forms of the disease are usually more severe, with early involvement of 
the fovea and more rapid decline of vision (Figure 5B) ( 131).
On OCT imaging the disruption of the photoreceptor layer (EZ) starts from the periphery 
(rod rich region) and gradually the functioning retina constricts to the fovea (Figure 5A), till 
it disappears, leading to blindness (Figure 5B). Both the width of the residual EZ, as well as 
the area of EZ on en face  analysis, are established sensitive measure of RP progression 
(132,133). Several studies employing AOSLO have reported a decrease in cone density 
and/or increased cone spacing in patients with RP ( 23).
Sector RP is an uncommon restricted form of RP in which only one or two retinal quadrants 
display clinical pathological signs (Figure 5C), and as such is associated with a good 
prognosis ( 134). A phase I/II gene therapy trials is on-going for PDE6B , MERTK , RPGR , 
and RLBP1 .Georgiou et al. Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptESCS
ESCS ( NR2E3 , OMIM 268100) is a rare slowly progressive AR form of retinal 
degeneration, typically characterised by nummular pigment clumping at the level of the 
RPE, often most plentiful around the temporal vascular arcades (Figure 5D) ( 135). OCT 
studies may show a disturbed perimacular region (thought to be filled with S-cone 
photoreceptors instead of rods), with thick and bulging retina and abnormal laminar 
architecture (Figure 5D) ( 136). Other imaging findings include: torpedo-like changes, deep 
atrophic lesions with a small hyperpigmented rim, helicoid subretinal fibrosis, 
circumferential fibrotic scars in the posterior pole with a spared centre, large fibrotic scars 
around the optic nerve head, and yellow-white dots in areas of relatively normal-appearing 
retina ( 137,138).
BCD
BCD ( CYP4V2 , OMIM 608614) is an AR disease, with similar clinical symptoms to RP, 
associated with progressive RPE-choriocapillaris complex atrophy and retinal crystals 
(Figure 5E), which can disappear with disease progression, resulting in greater RPE 
disruption ( 139,140). FAF shows sharply demarcated areas of RPE loss that coincide with 
abrupt edges of outer retinal atrophy on OCT; with the crystals generally situated on or in, 
the RPE/Bruch’s complex ( 139).
ROD Dysfunction syndromes
Rod Dysfunction syndromes are a genetically diverse group of non-progressive primary 
dysfunctions of the rod system, most commonly causing congenital stationary night 
blindness (CSNB) - with [Fundus Albipunctatus (FA) and Oguchi Disease] or without 
abnormal fundi (complete and incomplete CSNB) ( 141).
Complete and Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (cCSNB/iCSNB)
In contrast to FA and Oguchi disease, which are described below, cCSNB/iCSNB have no 
distinctive fundus appearance with normal or myopic fundi ( 142). Electrophysiological 
findings are the key to differentiate cCSNB and iCSNB; complete dysfunction of on-
pathway and incomplete dysfunction of both on- and off-pathways ( 143). cCSNB/iCSNB 
have a heterogeneous genetic background including AD, AR and X-linked, with variable V A 
and night blindness ( 141). Aland Eye Disease is a form of X-linked incomplete CSNB, due 
to variants in CACNA1F , with common features of nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia visible on 
OCT, and subnormal V A ( 144,145). OCT in 3 patients with GRM6  variants (AR CSNB) 
identified selective thinning of the inner retinal layers suggesting either reduced bipolar or 
ganglion cell numbers or altered synaptic structure in the inner retina ( 146).
FA
FA is an AR disease characterized by multiple white subretinal spots ( 147), throughout the 
retina (Figure 6A). FA has been attributed to variants in RDH5 , RLBP1  and RPE65  (148). 
RDH5  retinopathy (also RPE65  and RLBP1 , albeit to a lesser extent) leads to reduced AF 
signal possibly because of absence of retinoid-derived fluorophores ( 147). The white dots in 
younger subjects appear as foci of increased signal on FAF imaging (Figure 6A). On OCT Georgiou et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptimaging the associated deposits extend from Bruch’s membrane to the external limiting 
membrane, with a focal loss of photoreceptor outer segments ( 147). Development of 
macular atrophy/cone dysfunction can be observed in a later stage of the disease ( 149–151).
Oguchi disease
Oguchi ( SAG , GRK1)  disease is a rare form of AR CSNB having the distinguishing feature 
of the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon: diffuse green-golden fundus discolouration in the 
presence of light (Figure 6B) which returns to normal after prolonged dark adaption 
(141,152) Foveal retinal thickness can be normal on OCT (Figure 6B) ( 146). AOSLO 
identified that rods, but not cones, change intensity after dark adaptation, suggesting that the 
fundus changes are the result of changes within the rods as opposed to changes at a different 
retinal locus ( 146). Development of peripheral atrophy is observed in a later stage of the 
disease ( 153).
Chorioretinal dystrophies
Choroideremia (CHM)
CHM ( CHM , OMIM 300390) is a rare X-linked condition characterized by degeneration of 
the choriocapillaris, RPE and retina (Figure 7A), with males presenting in early adulthood or 
late childhood with nyctalopia and constricted peripheral vision ( 154). The skewed X-
inactivation can lead to symptomatic female carriers (Figure 7B), sharing similar imaging 
characteristics to affected males. FAF of the disease allows direct visualization of the 
choroidal vessels due to loss of the photoreceptor layers and the RPE, with a residual 
asymmetric central area of functioning retina.
Common OCT findings include IZ attenuation, with or without intact EZ, outer retinal 
tubulations, interlaminar bridges and RPE thinning ( 155–157). AOSLO has been employed 
extensively, demonstrating a normal photoreceptor mosaic in asymptomatic carriers and 
patchy cone loss in symptomatic carriers ( 155). Affected males have disrupted parafoveal 
mosaics, with increased cone spacing. The cone spacing is more regular near the borders of 
atrophy ( 155). The largest multimodal study to date including the use of AOSLO ( 156), 
describes a relatively intact central retina with a normal or reduced cone density at 0.5 mm 
eccentricity; and an abrupt loss of cones at the border of RPE atrophy, as well as hyper-
reflective clumps of cones in younger patients (<30 years) and bubble-like lesions within the 
choroid ( 157). IZ drop-out precedes EZ disruption and no RPE cells were visible in areas of 
cone loss ( 156). Investigators thereby proposed that CHM is primarily an RPE disorder 
followed by photoreceptor degeneration; recent OCTA studies have similar conclusions. A 
phase II/III gene therapy trial is on-going.
Gyrate atrophy (GA)
GA ( OAT , OMIM 613349) is a rare in-born error of metabolism with retinal manifestations 
of progressive chorioretinal loss, beginning as small areas of peripheral RPE and choroidal 
atrophy, which coalesce to larger well demarcated atrophic area, visible on FAF as area of 
decreased AF (Figure 7C) ( 158). On OCT macular oedema can be seen, as well as retinal 
tubulations in advanced disease ( 158,159).Georgiou et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptConcluding remarks & future prospects
Advances in molecular genetic techniques have greatly simplified molecular diagnosis. 
Similarly, advances in retinal imaging and retinal function testing have improved knowledge 
of disease natural history, which is key to identifying treatment effects in clinical trials of 
novel therapies. The remaining challenge is to develop novel therapies that will slow 
degeneration or improve function. The ongoing and upcoming trials emphasise the 
increasing need for further detailed investigation of retinal structure, to better explore the 
natural history of the diseases, the reliability and repeatability of the different imaging 
methods and measurements, and moreover define inclusion criteria, prognostic indicators 
and endpoints.

on FAF and a central ring of increased signal. On OCT, there is loss of the parafoveal 
photoreceptors. (B) X-linked RP ( RP2); foveal involvement with atrophy of the foveal RPE, 
visible on FAF, and corresponding loss of both inner and outer retina on OCT. (C) 
Autosomal dominant RP ( RHO ; Rhodopsin); sector pattern of retinal involvement with the 
inferior quadrant being affected, and a clear demarcation line of increased signal on FAF. 
(D) Enhanced S-cone syndrome ( NR2E3 ); nummular pigment clumping at the level of the 
RPE, most plentiful around the temporal vascular arcades on FAF and thickened ellipsoid 
zone on OCT. (E) Bietti Crystalline Dystrophy ( CYP4V2 ), on the left, a colour fundus Georgiou et al. Page 28

imaging with corresponding horizontal trans-foveal optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
(A) Choroideremia ( CHM ) in a 35-year-old male with large areas of atrophy on FAF, not yet 
involving foveal center on OCT. (B) Choroideremia ( CHM ) in a severely affected 75 year 
old female carrier with large areas of atrophy on FAF and involving the foveal center on 
OCT, with a small area of spared ellipsoid zone. (C) Gyrate Atrophy ( OAT ); large well-
demarcated coalesced areas of atrophy visible on FAF as decreased AF, and OCT with 
macular oedema and retinal tubulations.Georgiou et al. Page 31
