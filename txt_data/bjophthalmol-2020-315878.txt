Aims To investigate the frequency of USH2A mutation 
and the clinical and genetic differences between Usher syndrome type II (USH2) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in 
a large cohort of Chinese patients.
Methods A total of 1381 patients with inherited 
retinal disease (IRD) were recruited. The phenotypic and genotypic information of patients with USH2A mutations 
was evaluated.
results The prevalence of patients with USH2A 
mutations was 15.75%, which was the most frequently detected gene in this cohort of patients. Hotspot of 
USH2A mutations was c.8559- 2A >G and c.2802T >G. 
Patients with USH2 had an earlier and more serious decline of visual function and damage to retina structure 
than did patients with RP in the first 10 years (p<0.05), 
but there was no difference in the visual prognosis 
between the two groups when the course of disease 
exceeded 10 years (p>0.05). Missense variants had less 
severe consequences and were found more commonly in RP , whereas more deleterious genotypes were associated 
with an earlier onset of disease and were found more 
commonly in USH2.
Conclusions This study provides detailed clinical–
genetic assessment of patients with USH2A mutations of Chinese origin, enabling precise genetic diagnoses, better 
management of these patients and putative therapeutic 
approaches.
InTroduCTIon
The USH2A gene (OMIM #608400), located 
on chromosome 1q41, consists of 72 exons, and 
encodes usherin, a transmembrane protein present 
in the basement membrane of many, but not all, 
tissues, including the photoreceptor layer of the retina and the hair cells in the cochlea. Usherin is important in the development and homeostasis 
of the inner ear and retina. Different mutations 
within this gene have been associated with a large heterogeneous group of diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Usher syndrome type II (USH2), cone- rod dystrophy and deafness.
1 2 The different 
phenotypes associated with USH2A are thought to be due to an allelic hierarchy of USH2A mutations.

To date, many efforts have been made to inves-
tigate the spectrum of mutations and genotype–phenotype correlations in patients with USH2A mutations. More than 1100 disease- causing vari-
ants in USH2A have been identified, including 
nonsense and missense mutations, splicing vari-
ants, small deletions and insertions, small indels and large rearrangements (Human Gene Mutation Database; professional version 2019.3). Previous 
studies confirmed that two truncating mutations 
in USH2A were associated mostly with USH2 in 
patients from Netherlands and Belgium, whereas other combinations can result in both RP and USH2.
4 Moreover, the presence of at least one 
truncating mutation was associated with earlier presentation of visual decline. However, the muta-
tion frequency and genotypic–phenotypic char -
acteristics vary widely between different ethnic 
groups.
5 6 For example, the most frequent muta-
tions in USH2A were the p.Glu767Serfs*21 and 
p.Cys759Phe mutations in Madrid,7 p.Glu767S-
erfs*21 of USH2 cases in Europe,8 p.Cys759Phe 
in RP cases in Spanish patients.9 Previous research 
found that p.Glu767Serfs*21 was associated mainly with USH2
10 and p.Cys759Phe with RP; however, 
Blanco- Kelly et al revealed that more than 60% of 
patients with p.Cys759Phe and 72.1% of patients 
with p.Glu767Serfs*21 had mild hearing loss.7
The genetic and clinical characteristics of patients 
with USH2A mutations have been reported in 
many studies; however, data for Chinese patients are limited. The exact genetic and phenotypic 
characteristics of patients with USH2A mutations in Chinese patients with inherited retinal disease (IRD) remain unknown. In the present study, we 
enrolled 1381 patients with IRD; patients under -
went molecular analysis and all those with USH2A 
mutations were identified. Our aim was to inves-tigate the genotypic–phenotypic characteristics and differences between RP and USH2 in a large series 
of patients with USH2A mutations in the Chinese 
population. These results would be useful for prog -
nosis, clinical management and genetic counselling and should provide strong evidence- based data 
support for gene therapy studies.

family members (total participants: 3967) were recruited from our genetics department between January 2016 and June 2019. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
before peripheral blood samples were collected.
next-generation sequencing analysis
Molecular testing was performed by targeted next- generation 
sequencing as previously reported.6 After sequencing, data 
analysis was performed as reported previously.6 11 Previously 
reported variants were determined using ClinVar (https://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ clinvar/) and Human Gene Mutation Data-
base (professional 2019.3). The potential pathogenicity of the variants was interpreted according to the American College of Medical Genetics. Before confirmation by Sanger sequencing, the candidate variants were reviewed by clinical geneticists and 
ophthalmologists. Segregation analysis was performed within 
family members.
Clinical examination
Full ophthalmic examinations were performed on all patients with pathogenic mutations in USH2A, including the best Snellen- corrected visual acuity testing (BCVA), slit lamp biomi-
croscopy, fundus examination, visual field (VF, Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer, Carl Zeiss, Dublin, California, USA), swept- domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis HRA 
+OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) and full- field electroretinography (according to the standards of the 
International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision; 
www. iscev. org). VF was assessed by 30-2 Swedish Interactive 
Threshold Algorithm Fast Programs to measure 30° temporally 
and nasally and test 76 points. The VF data were excluded if fixa -
tion miss loss and false- positive and false- negative response rates 
were greater than 20%. Average depression of visual sensitivity was estimated by mean deviation (MD). The central foveal thick-ness (CFT, within the central 1 mm region) was defined as the 
distance between the internal limiting membrane and the inner border of the retinal pigment epithelium. To provide numeric 
values for low BCVAs, the following conversions were made: no 
light perception, 0; light perception, 0.0001; hand movements, 0.001; and counting fingers, 0.01. Clinical diagnosis of USH2 and RP was based on ocular examination and hearing tests. 
Patients with USH2 have typical RP fundus appearance, senso-
rineural hearing impairment and intact vestibular function, and RP referred to non- syndromic RP , which has typical RP fundus 
appearance without extraocular disorders in this study.
statistical analysis
Measurement values of the groups were compared using the t- test and one- way analysis of variance test. Correlations were 
evaluated using the Pearson and partial correlation tests. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using SPSS V .20.0 (SPSS/IBM 
Corp.) and Microsoft Excel (2010). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.89

Cohort characteristics
Of the 1381 patients with IRD, 1035 received a genetic diag-
nosis. The prevalence of patients with USH2A mutations was 15.75% (n=163), making USH2A the most frequently mutated 
gene in this cohort of patients with IRD. The mean age was 42.85±15.37 years (range, 2–80 years; median, 43 years) in our cohort of 93 men and 70 women. Table 1 shows the 
demographic and clinical characteristics. Eighty- eight patients 
(53.99%, 88/163) from 77 families were diagnosed with USH2 (40.19±15.32 years), and 75 patients (46.01%, 75/163) from 70 families were diagnosed with RP (45.85±14.96 years).
Phenotypic studies
The median age of onset of patients with USH2 was 15.34±12.62 years (range 0–46), which was younger than that of patients with RP (23.37±15.72 years; range 0–64; p<0.05). There was no 
difference in mean BCVA or CFT between RP and USH2 groups overall, but when dividing the cohort into patients younger and 
older than 50 years, the difference became statistically signifi-cant (p<0.05). The VF and CFT were impaired more severely 
in patients with USH2 (−26.59±3.61 dB, 210.75±39.63 µm) 
than in patients with RP (−23.73±6.45 dB, 232.39±49.93 µm) 
younger than 50 years (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), 
whereas BCVA was impaired more severely in patients with 
USH2 (0.11±0.22) older than 50 years (p<0.05, table 1). In 
the first decade from disease onset, BCVA, VF and CFT declined 
in both groups, but VF and CFT declined more severely in 
patients with USH2 (−26.26±3.28 dB, 224.00±33.03 µm) 
than in patients with RP (−20.71±7.45 dB, 256.67±52.76 µm; 
p<0.05); nevertheless, the differences became insignificant 
as the disease progressed (p>0.05). Moreover, BCVA in both 
groups and VF and CFT in the RP group declined with disease progression (p<0.05), whereas progression of VF and CFT in 
patients with USH2 did not differ significantly between patients with a disease course >10 years and that <10 years (p>0.05). 90

Figure 1 Proportions of USH2A gene mutations in patients with 
retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Usher syndrome type II (USH2) in this 
study. (A) The proportion of different mutations types in patients with RP and USH2. (B) The proportion of different combinations of mutations 
types in patients with RP and USH2. M, missense; SNFO, splice site, 
nonsense, frameshift, or other (readthrough, gross deletions and small 
indels).
Legal blindness due to VF loss occurred within 10 years after 
disease onset in patients with USH2, whereas VF loss in patients 
with RP was relatively comparable to that in patients with USH2 
only 10 years after disease onset (p>0.05). All of these results indicate that patients with USH2 have an earlier and more serious decline of visual function and damage to retinal structure 
than patients with RP in the first 10 years after onset, but that 
visual prognosis between the two groups does not differ when the course of disease exceeds 10 years.
To better assess disease progression and the difference 
between the two groups, we assessed correlations among disease 
duration, age, BCVA, MD and CFT using correlation analysis 
(table 2). Results showed that BCVA decreased significantly with disease progression and age in both patients with RP and USH2 (p<0.01), but MD and CFT were not correlated with disease 
progression or age (p>0.05). Thus, the rate of disease progres -
sion may depend on the initial diagnosis or the course of the 
disease and on other key factors.
Genetic studies
A total of 344 mutations were identified, of which 197 (57.27%) were missense, 33 were nonsense, 43 were frameshift, 64 were splice- site, 3 were readthrough, 3 were gross deletions and 1 
a small indel. The most common mutations were c.2802T >G (11.88%) and c.8559- 2A >G (9.28%), accounting for 21.16% 
of all mutations. It is likely that these two variants represent a hotspot of USH2A in the Chinese population. Six muta-
tions, c.99_100insT, c.11156G >A, c.15178T >C, c.4821G 
>C, c.8232G >C and c.9469C >T, accounted for another 15.94% of the total. Of the 156 distinct variants identified in this study, 84 were novel, including 13 pathogenic variants, 32 likely pathogenic variants and 39 variants of uncertain signifi-
cance (see online supplementary table 1). Of the 163 patients with pathogenic mutations on both alleles, 14 (8.59%) were 
homozygous and 149 (91.41%) were compound heterozygous. 
Only eight distinct pathogenic homozygous mutations were 
detected, of which four (c.15575_15579delAGGAA, c.8232G >C, c.8559- 2A >G, c.99_100insT) were associated with USH2 
and four (c.11156G >A, c.13465G >A, c.2802T >G, c.4616C >T) with RP . These variants are presumed to be USH2 or RP 
specific. Additionally, one de novo mutation (c.2802T >G) was 
identified in the 54 trios (1.85%).
Genotype–phenotype correlations
Of all the USH2A mutations associated with RP (n=158), 77.22% (n=122) were missense variants and 22.78% (n=21) were nonsense (n=11), frameshift (n=7), or splice- site muta-
tions (n=18) that severely affected protein function. In the USH2 group (n=187), which had a severe early- onset clinical 
presentation, only 40.64% (n=76) mutations were missense and 59.36% were non- missense, including splice- site (n=46), 
frameshift (n=36), nonsense (n=22), readthrough (n=3), gross deletions (n=3) and small indels (n=1) (figure 1). Moreover, of all the patients with RP , 39 (52%) had missense +missense (M+M) mutations and 36 (48%) had missense +splice- site/
frameshift/nonsense mutations (M+SFNO); no patients with 
SFNO+SFNO mutations were identified. However, in patients 
with USH2, only 7 (8%) patients had M+M mutations, 52 (59%) had M+SFNO and 29 (33%) had SFNO+SFNO muta-tions. These results suggested that USH2 was associated with a 
more severe genotype.
To further understand the relationship between genotype 
and clinical features, we stratified all patients into three groups: 
group I comprised patients with M+M mutations, group II had patients with M+SFNO mutations and group III had patients 
with SFNO +SFNO mutations. Then, BCVA, MD and CFT of 
the three groups were compared and analysed (tables 3 and 4). Overall, 84.78% (39/46) of the patients in group I and 40.91% (36/88) in group II had RP , whereas all patients in group III 
had USH2 (no patients with RP were identified in group III). 
Moreover, the median age of onset of group III (12.59±11.37 years) was earlier than that of patients in group I (22.74±14.86 years) or group II (19.32±14.92 years; p<0.001). These results suggested that SFNO mutations in USH2A were associated 
mostly with USH2 (p<0.001) and resulted in an earlier onset of 
disease. We found no significant differences in mean duration, BCVA, MD or CFT among the three groups, although BCVA decreased significantly with disease progression in all groups 
(p<0.001). We found no significant correlations between disease 
duration and MD or CFT in the three groups (p>0.05), indi-cating that MD and CFT progression were not directly related to mutation type.
dIsCussIon
In this study, we provide a brief overview of USH2A  mutation 
frequency in a large cohort of Chinese patients. Of the 1035 patients with IRD, 163 had mutations in USH2A; this preva-
lence (15.75%) being the highest of patients with IRD in this study population. Additionally, 53.99% were diagnosed with USH2 and 46.01% were diagnosed with RP , indicating a rela-tively balanced clinical profile of USH2A - associated diseases in 
this population. These data provide valuable information for researchers in gene therapy as well as economists and govern -
ment policy- makers.

cohort of patients with USH2A mutations,4 but all their partici-
pants were of European origin. It is uncertain whether the same 
conclusions would be reached in a Chinese population and, to date, the underlying genetic and phenotypic characteristics of 
Chinese patients with USH2A mutations have not been compre-
hensively explored. In this study, we found that patients with USH2 had an earlier and more severe decline of visual function 
and damage to the retinal structure than did patients with RP in 
the first decade from disease onset, which is consistent with a 
previous study.
4 However, our study confirmed that the progres -
sion of RP accelerated in the second decade of the disease, and 
that there was no difference in visual prognosis between patients with USH2 and RP when the disease duration exceeded 10 years. 
These data indicate that the optimal intervention window for 
subretinal gene therapy is within the first decade from disease onset.Consistent with previous studies, the hotspot of USH2A 
was c.8559- 2A >G in Chinese and Japanese patients,
12 13 but 
hotspot of USH2A in European patients (p.Glu767Serfs*21 
and p.Cys759Phe) was not detected in this study.7 10 Besides, 
we found that c.2802T>G was a USH2A mutation hotspot in 
our cohort of Chinese patients. We also identified 84 novel 
variants, confirming that the mutation spectrum of USH2A in 
Chinese patients differs from that of other populations. Thus 
far, it is unknown why some mutations in USH2A lead to USH2 
and others to RP . As most patients are compound heterozy -
gotes, it is difficult to assess the effect of individual mutations 
on the phenotype. Nevertheless, variants in the homozygous 
state represent an ideal model by which to search for disease- specific alleles. Previous studies found that five variants 
(c.2802T >G, c.10073G>A, c.11156G>A, c.12 295–3T>A 
and c.12575G>A) are RP specific, and three (c.12 295–3T>A, 
c.9056- 2A>G, and c.5776+1G>A) are USH2 specific.
3 Further 
data from our cohort showed that c.13465G>A, c.4616C>T, 
and two reported variants, c.2802T>G and c.11156G>A, were 
specific to RP , whereas c.15575_15579delAGGAA, c.8232G>C, c.8559- 2A>G and c.99_100insT were specific to USH2. A 
known genotype would allow for better correlation of clinical signs and counselling of patients.
In patients with RP , 77.22% of USH2A mutations were 
missense, whereas in patients with USH2, only 40.64% of mutations were missense; all other mutations were nonsense, frameshift or splice- site mutations that severely affected protein 
function. This may imply that missense variants in USH2A have less severe consequences and are therefore found more 
commonly in the milder RP than in the more severe USH2. 
Each RP genotype documented included at least one missense variant, whereas the two deleterious mutations were restricted to the USH2 phenotype, consistent with previous reports.
4 We 
hypothesise that RP results from genotypes that include milder 
hypomorphic alleles; further experimental verification of this 
hypothesis is needed. We further explored this observation by analysing the relationship between genotype and clinical features 
of USH2A mutations, which confirmed that more deleterious 
genotypes, including frameshift, nonsense, gross deletions and 
small indels, were associated with an earlier onset of disease, 
regardless of the phenotype. The disease progression rate was 92

not directly related to the genotype; thus, additional genetic or 
environmental modifiers may play a role in disease progression.
In summary, we presented the overall frequency of USH2A- 
associated IRD and a detailed clinical and genetic characterisa -
tion of patients of Chinese origin with USH2A mutations. We 
found that missense variants had less severe consequences and were found more commonly in the milder RP; the more delete-
rious genotypes were associated with an earlier onset of disease. 
Although the rate of disease progression was not directly related to genotype, we found no difference in visual prognosis among patients with USH2A mutations when the course of disease exceeded 10 years. Our data provide a deeper understanding of 
USH2A mutations in China and enable precise genetic diagnoses 
and better management of these patients, and serve as a well- founded reference for genetic counselling and development of potential therapeutic approaches.
