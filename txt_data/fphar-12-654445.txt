Extracellular ATP and its ultimate degradation product adenosine are potent extracellular
signaling molecules that elicit a variety of pathophysiological pathways in retina through theactivation of P2 and P1 purinoceptors, respectively. Excessive build-up of extracellularATP accelerates pathologic responses in retinal diseases, whereas accumulation ofadenosine protects retinal cells against degeneration or in ﬂammation. This mini-review
focuses on the roles of ATP and adenosine in three types of blinding diseases includingage-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR).Several agonists and antagonists of ATP receptors and adenosine receptors (ARs)have been developed for the potential treatment of glaucoma, DR and AMD:antagonists of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) (BBG, MRS2540) prevent ATP-inducedneuronal apoptosis in glaucoma, DR, and AMD; A1 receptor (A1R) agonists (INO-8875) lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma; A2A receptor (A2AR) agonists(CGS21680) or antagonists (SCH58261, ZM241385) reduce neuroin ﬂammation in
glaucoma, DR, and AMD; A3 receptor (A3R) agonists (2-Cl-lB-MECA, MRS3558)protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from apoptosis in glaucoma.

INTRODUCTION
Purines and their derivatives, most notably adenosine and ATP, are the key molecules controlling
intracellular energy homoeostasis and nucleotide synthesis ( Huang et al., 2021 ). High concentrations
of ATP are present within cells and ATP is released into the extracellular milieu during cellulardamage or death. Extracellular ATP acts at P2 receptors, including ligand-gated ion channel (P2X1-7) receptors and metabotropic G-protein linked purinergic receptors (P2Y1,2,4,6,11-14) ( Jacobson
et al., 2020 ;Illes et al., 2021 ), whereas adenosine acts at P1 G protein-coupled receptors, classi ﬁed into
four subtypes: A1R, A2AR, A2BR and A3R ( Santiago et al., 2020 ). Expression of several P1 and P2
receptors were detected in the retina ( Figure 1 )(Ventura et al., 2019 ). ATP and adenosine
metabolizing in the extracellular conditions mediate pathologic process within the retina
(Figure 1 ). ATP signaling is tightly regulated by ectonucleotidases including ectonucleoside
triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) such as CD39, which rapidly hydrolyses ATPand ADP to AMP ( Dwyer et al., 2020 ). And then 5 ′-ectonucleotidase CD73 degrades AMP to
adenosine ( Dwyer et al., 2020 ). Commonly, ATP and adenosine acting at their respective receptors
generate opposite responses ( Kukulski et al., 2011 ;Sanderson et al., 2014 ;Jacobson et al., 2020 ;Illes
et al., 2021 ). Excessive extracellular ATP released from stressed retinal cells is recognized as an
endogenous danger signal in retinal injury or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma,and diabetic retinopathy (DR) ( Notomi et al., 2011 ;Niyadurupola et al., 2013 ). In this review, weEdited by:

retinal cells linked to the three types of blinding diseases (AMD,glaucoma, and DR), as well as emphasized the therapeutic
potential of agonists and antagonists of ATP receptors and
ARs for these diseases.
ATP AND ADENOSINE IN THE RETINA
ATP and Adenosine in the Retinal Neuronal
Cell Death or Survival
ATP is released from all main types of retinal neurons
(horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells) being a co-transmitter with inhibitory (GABA), or excitatory (glutamate)
neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides ( Ward et al., 2010 ). Similar
to glutamate excitotoxicity, high levels of extracellular ATPreleased by stressed cells activate P2 receptors on neighboringneurons causing in ﬂux of calcium. The cytotoxic calcium
overload is induced by overactivation of P2X receptorsevoking calcium in ﬂux through receptors themselves or
through voltage-gated calcium channels and by activation ofP2Y receptors that induces a sustained calcium in ﬂux
following rapid transient release of calcium from internalstores ( Fletcher, 2010 ;Aplin et al., 2014 ;Fowler et al., 2014 ).
Much attention has been attracted to P2X7R which forms largeplasma membrane pores that mediate cytolysis and
inﬂammasome-dependent cell death ( Fowler et al., 2014 ).
Under pathological conditions, the upregulation of P2X7Rpredisposes retinal neurons to damage. For instance, theincreased level of extracellular ATP caused by the elevation ofthe intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes chronicallyactivates P2X7R thus leading to death of a subpopulation ofRGCs ( Zhang et al., 2007 ). Apart from the ATP released from the
retinal cells to cause cell death, exogenous administration of ATPalso impairs retinal cells ( Puthussery and Fletcher, 2009 ). Further
evidence demonstrated that the BzATP- (P2X7R agonists)-mediated Ca
2+increases is 112-fold higher compared to ATP
in cultured RGCs, when both agonists were used at 10 µM; 62-
fold at 30 μM; and 23-fold at 100 µM. BzATP led to a
concentration-dependent reduction in the number of cells witha median lethal dose of 35 µM, which was prevented by theP2X7R antagonists BBG and oxidized ATP, rather than 30 µMsuramin (a nonselective P2 receptor antagonist) ( Zhang et al.,
2005 ). Moreover, high concentrations of ATP injected into the
eyes of rodents ( Puthussery and Fletcher, 2009 ) or feline ( Aplin
et al., 2014 ) model also lead to rapid irreversible loss of

mediate pathologic process within the retina. Extracellular ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, AMP, adenosine by the activity of CD39 and CD73. Extracellular ATP and
adenosine interact, therefore causing their activation, with P2 (P2X, P2Y) and P1 (A1, A2A, A2B, A3) purinergic receptors, respectively. On one hand , Calcium-
dependent cell death pathways due to increased ATP or glutamate and in ﬂammasome-dependent cell death pathway induced by P2X7 pore formation accompanied
with activation of apoptosis-inducing factor, both contribute to retinal cells death or apoptosis. Extracellular ATP stimulates retinal microgli a activity to release neurotoxic
factors, (e.g.TNF- α,I L - 1 β) exerting pro-in ﬂammatory action. Stimulation of P2X7R raises lysosomal pH (blue arrows) in RPE cells and lowers autophagy, which contribute
to lysosomal alkalinization and lipofuscin accumulation. On the other hand, A1R and A3R inhibit adenylyl cyclase decreasing intracellular cyclic a denosine
monophosphate (cAMP) levels (red arrows) while A2AR and A2BR activate adenylyl cyclase increasing intracellular cAMP levels (blue arrows). Adenos ine acting at A1R
signi ﬁcantly decreases the glutamate-induced calcium in ﬂux (red arrows) contributing to cell survival. Adenosine exerts anti-in ﬂammatory action, as well as decreases
lysosome pH (red arrows). Moreover, A1R opening the potassium and chloride channels, increases the ﬂuid clearance from the edematous retina via increased extrusion
into the blood of ionic osmolytes.
Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 654445 2Ye et al. Purinergic Signaling and Retinaphotoreceptor. Intravitreal injection of 50 mM ATP causes
signiﬁcant loss of visual function within 1 day and loss of 50%
of photoreceptor cell within 1 week in eyes of rats ( Vessey et al.,
2014 ). Thirty hours after 100 μL intravitreal injection of ATP with
a concentration of 55 mM in a feline model, widespread
photoreceptor cell death took place ( Aplin et al., 2014 ); and
injection of ATP with concentrations of 11, 22, or 55 mM causedloss of retinal function and gross changes in retinal structurewithin 2 weeks.
Adenosine protects neurons against hyperexcitation and
glutamate toxicity by inhibiting presynaptic voltage-dependentcalcium channels thus reducing transmitter release of glutamate,acetylcholine, and ATP ( Chen et al., 2014 ;Santos-Rodrigues et al.,
2015 ), or inhibiting N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
(Hartwick et al., 2004 ). Adenosine modulates RGC function
and confers general neuroprotection through A 1R(Lu et al.,
2017 ). Acting at A3R adenosine inhibits P2X7-induced
increases in calcium and apoptosis of RGCs ( Boia et al., 2020 ).
In isolated rat RGCs, adenosine (10 and 100 μM) signi ﬁcantly
decreased the glutamate-induced calcium in ﬂux, which was
blocked by A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine(DPCPX) ( Hartwick et al., 2004 ). Chronic activation of A2AR
dependent cAMP signaling prevents glutamate-induced celldeath in chick retinal neurons and photoreceptors ( Paes-de-
Carvalho et al., 2003 ). Stimulation of A3R by either
endogenous or synthesized agonist (2-Cl-lB-MECA or
MRS3558) can reduce calcium response to NMDA receptor
activation in retinal ganglion cells ( Zhang et al., 2010 ). These
data suggest that the adenosine exerts an inhibitory in ﬂuence on
retinal neurons by modulating excitatory glutaminergic signaling,thus promoting retinal neural cells survival. Stimulation of A1Rwith the agonist N-Cyclopentiladenosine (CPA) protectedagainst photoreceptor cell death in light-induced retinaldegeneration model probably due to the presynaptic inhibitionof glutamate release and the modulation of NMDA receptoractivity ( Soliño et al., 2018 ). This protective capacity of adenosine
at photoreceptor cell is consistent with neuromodulator role of
adenosine in glutaminergic signaling.
ATP and Adenosine in the Retinal Pigment
Epithelium (RPE) Cell Degeneration
ATP can be released at sites of in ﬂammation and upregulate
P2X7R expression in human epithelial cells; P2X7R mRNA andprotein are also expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)cells ( Yang et al., 2011 ). Therefore, ATP released during
pathologic conditions increases P2X7 expression in the RPEand thus increases the vulnerability of RPE cells to
extracellular ATP-induced cell death. Both endogenous P2X7
agonist ATP and the synthetic, P2X7 agonist BzATP increasedintracellular Ca
2+by extracellular Ca2+inﬂux and induced
apoptosis of RPE cells. These effects are inhibited by P2X7antagonist OxATP but not by the P2 receptor antagonistsuramin ( Yang et al., 2011 ), indicating that ATP induced RPE
apoptosis by activation of P2X7R. Stimulation of P2X7 alsoactivates p38, which induces secretion of monocytechemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), andvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); IL-8 and VEGF
promote angiogenesis leading to choroidal neovascularization,a hallmark of wet AMD ( Fowler et al., 2014 ). Balance between
extracellular ATP and adenosine alters lysosomal activity of RPE
cells and the production of lipofuscin. Stimulation of P2X7R
raises lysosomal pH in RPE cells and decreases autophagy, whichcontributes to lysosomal alkalinization ( Guha et al., 2013 ) and
digestion impairment of peroxidized photoreceptor lipids,resulting in accumulation of lipofuscin and formation oflipoprotein-containing drusen beneath the RPE ( Guha et al.,
2013 ). Conversely, adenosine stimulating A2AR reacidi ﬁes
lysosomes. The mechanism underlying restoration of acidiclysosomal pH may be linked to the elevation of cytoplasmiccAMP following stimulation of adenosine A2AR ( Liu et al., 2008 ).
In summary, elevation of adenosine signaling represents a
positive response of RPE cells to AMD.
ATP and Adenosine in the Müller Cell
Volume
Müller cells intimately contact neurons and non-neural
structures providing for uptake of neurotransmitters fromextracellular space, as well as controlling retinal potassium andwater homeostasis to maintain the extracellular space volume(Bringmann et al., 2006 ). Activation of P2X7 depolarizes Müller
cells, thus decreasing the rate of the glial glutamate uptake
resulting in elevated extracellular glutamate levels.
Glutamatergic neurotransmission evokes ion currents whichlead to osmotic imbalances and a swelling of neuronal cellsbodies and synapses ( Vogler et al., 2013 ). Intense neuronal
activity also decreases extracellular osmolarity due to theactivity-dependent decrease in extracellular sodium chloridewhich is approximately twice as large as the increase inextracellular potassium ( Vogler et al., 2013 ). Then, decreased
extracellular osmolarity and the uptake of neuron-derivedosmolytes contribute to Müller cells swelling and retinaledema ( Vogler et al., 2013 ). Under this hypoosmotic
conditions, passive potassium ef ﬂux through Kir4.1 channels
and activation of a purinergic signal transduction cascade(consecutive ATP and adenosine from Müller cells) are twomain mechanisms preventing swelling of Müller cells(Pannicke et al., 2004 ). Release of ATP from Müller cells is
central to maintain water dynamics in the retina, whilepreventing this release causes retinal swelling and edema(Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2016 ). On the other hand,
adenosine acting at A1R results in the opening of potassiumand chloride channels that allow ion ef ﬂux thus increasing ﬂuid
clearance from the edematous retina ( Schwartz et al., 2016 ).
Osmo-mechanosensitive release of ATP from Müller cells is
impaired in diabetic retinopathy (DR). In contrast, glutamate-induced release of ATP from Müller cells remains protectiveagainst osmotic swelling. Various receptor ligands such asvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induce a release ofglutamate from Müller cells thus contributing to purinergicsignaling involved in the inhibition of osmotic swelling (likeabove) ( Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2016 ;Schwartz et al.,
2016 ). Extracellular ATP is converted by NTPDase2 to ADP
Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 654445 3Ye et al. Purinergic Signaling and Retinathat activates P2Y1, further facilitating release of adenosine by
nucleoside transporters and ultimately inhibit cell swelling(Weick et al., 2005 ). These data suggest that extracellular ATP
contributes to neuronal hyperexcitation and edema development
under pathological conditions, whereas VEGF-induced glutamate
and glutamatergic-purinergic signaling (especially adenosinesignaling) prevent retinal edema. Therefore, activation ofP2Y1R or A1R would be considered as a potential strategy forthe control of retinal edema.
ATP and Adenosine in the Microglial Activity
Microglia contribute to retinal in ﬂammation, migrating toward
the region of injury where they phagocyte pathogens. However,excessive or prolonged activation of microglial reactivity cancause chronic microgliosis and loss of autoregulatory
mechanisms thus leading to retinal in ﬂammation and
degeneration ( Kerur et al., 2013 ;Santiago et al., 2020 ).
Extracellular ATP stimulates retinal microgliosis in response tooverstimulated glutamatergic transmission which is apathogenetic factor in hypoxia, glaucoma, DR, andphotoreceptor degeneration ( Liu et al., 2016 ;Loukovaara et al.,
2017 ). Reactive microglia promote the release of neurotoxic
factors such as tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α), IL-1 β,
oxygen and nitrogen free radicals, and Fas-ligand, contributingto neuronal and photoreceptor cell degeneration ( Baudouin et al.,
2020 ). Upregulation of TNF- α, IL-1 β, and IL-6 that occurs
following P2X7 activation induces RGCs death under elevated
intraocular pressure ( Sugiyama et al., 2013 ). Therefore,
suppression of microglia reactivity has protective effects.
Adenosine possesses anti-in ﬂammatory properties in retina
(Aires et al., 2019a ;Aires et al., 2019b ). The increased adenosine
at inﬂamed sites can protect against cellular damage by activating
A2AR ( Ibrahim et al., 2011 ), by inhibiting release of TNF- αfrom
microglia induced by hypoxia and lipopolysaccharide, and byinhibiting microgliosis ( Jamwal et al., 2019 ). Cannabidiol, an
anti-in ﬂammatory molecule, prevents the adenosine uptake and
subsequently activates adenosine A2AR to inhibit retinal
microglia activation ( Liou et al., 2008 ). Considering the
contribution of neuroin ﬂammation for the pathophysiology of
retinal degeneration, therapies focused on pro-in ﬂammatory
ATP and immunosuppressive adenosine and their receptorsare signi ﬁcant to retinal blinding diseases.
THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF ATP AND
ADENOSINE IN RETINAL DISEASES
Glaucoma
Increased vitreal concentration of ATP has been identi ﬁed as a
contributing factor in the death of ganglion cells and observed inanimal models and humans with glaucoma ( Reigada et al., 2008 ),
the second leading cause of blindness in the world, accompaniedby elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), death of RGC, andincreased in ﬂammatory response ( Baudouin et al., 2020 ). ATP
modulates retinal neurotransmission, affecting retinal blood ﬂow
and intraocular pressure. The ATP analog β,γ-methylene ATP is
more effective in reducing intraocular pressure (40%) thanmuscarinic agonists such as pilocarpine (25%) and
β-adrenoceptor blockers (30%), raising the potential for the
use of purinergic agents in glaucoma ( Burnstock, 2006 ). In
chronic glaucoma, ATP is released via pannexin hemichannels
in astrocytes of the optic nerve and stimulates P2X7R that can
lead to cell death in the retina ( Beckel et al., 2014 ). Antagonists of
the P2X7R prevent neuronal apoptosis in the retina induced byATP. At present, the P2X7R antagonists Brilliant Blue G (BBG)and MRS2540 have been proved to be useful in treating glaucoma(Sakamoto et al., 2015 ;Dong et al., 2018 ). Agonists of P2Y2
receptor (P2Y2R) and P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6R) decrease IOP(Markovskaya et al., 2008 ;Ginsburg-Shmuel et al., 2012 ;
Jacobson and Civan, 2016 ). Topically applied P2Y6R agonist
UDP reduced rabbit IOP by 17%, while TG46, a potent agonist ofthe P2Y6R, administered topically decreased IOP in rabbits by
45% ( Markovskaya et al., 2008 ;Ginsburg-Shmuel et al., 2012 ).
Treatment with A1R agonists (such as INO-8875) lowers IOP
by enhancing aqueous humor out ﬂow ( Lu et al., 2017 ). A2AR
agonist CGS21680 decreased retinal in ﬂammation in a mouse
model of traumatic optic neuropathy ( Ahmad et al., 2013 ). A3R
agonists such as 2-Cl-lB-MECA ( Galvao et al., 2015 ;Boia et al.,
2020 ) and MRS3558 ( Jacobson and Civan, 2016 ) protect RGCs
from apoptosis induced by ATP and other factors that activate theP2X7R. Therefore, targeting this receptor might be bene ﬁcial for
glaucoma affecting RGCs. Selective A
2AR antagonist (SCH58261)
suppressed elevated pressure-induced in ﬂammation, oxidative
stress, and cell death in retinal cells ( Aires et al., 2019a ), as
well as prevented RGC death from high intraocular pressure-induced transient ischemic injury ( Madeira et al., 2016 ).
Intravitreal injection of A2AR antagonist ZM241385 reducedmicrogliosis and downregulated the proin ﬂammatory cytokines
expression in rat model ( Liu et al., 2016 ). These apparent
contradictory results might be explained by the type of injuryinﬂicted, different modes of drug administration, and the cell
types involved. This issue is signi ﬁcant because effects mediated
by A2AR are bidirectional, depending on the target cell ( Dai and
Zhou, 2011 ). Another interesting study indicated that the
relationship between intake of caffeine, a nonselective
antagonist of ARs, and glaucoma was null, but greaterconsumption of caffeine was associated with higher prevalenceof IOP and glaucoma ( Kim et al., 2020 ).
Diabetic Retinopathy
DR is another major cause of blindness, accompanied by chronic
inﬂammation, neuronal and glial dysfunctions, and cell death.
Metabolic disorders and hyperglycemia may lead to change ofintracellular and extracellular nucleotide levels ( Loukovaara et al.,
2017 ). Extracellular ATP induces formation of P2X7R pores and
cell death in retinal microvessels in the model of DR ( Burnstock
and Novak, 2013 ;Burnstock, 2018 ), suggesting that purinergic
vasotoxicity plays a crucial role in microvascular cell death, afeature of DR. With respect to extracellular ADO in DR, it wasdemonstrated that triamcinolone, used clinically for the rapidresolution of diabetic macular edema, can induce the release andformation of endogenous adenosine and subsequently activateA1R receptors resulting in ion ef ﬂux through potassium and
chloride channels and prevention of osmotic swelling ( Wurm
Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 654445 4Ye et al. Purinergic Signaling and Retinaet al., 2008 ). A1R-dependent mechanism may contribute to the
inhibition effect of triamcinolone on osmotic swelling of Müllerglial cells in retinas ( Uckermann et al., 2005 ;Wurm et al., 2008 ).
Using A2AR agonist CGS21680 decreased hyperglycemia-
induced retinal cell death, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-
αrelease in activated microglia in DR ( Ibrahim et al., 2011 ).
Intravitreal injection of the A2AR antagonist SCH58261protected the retina against microglial reactivity andneuroin ﬂammation, rescued retinal vascular leakage, reduced
retinal cell death and the loss of retinal ganglion cells inducedby diabetes ( Aires et al., 2019b ).
Furthermore, caffeine could reduce RPE cells monolayer
permeability after exposure to high glucose anddesferoxamine, and prevent outer blood-retinal barrier(BRB) damage by inhibiting apoptotic cell death ( Maugeri
et al., 2017 ). Neuroprotective effect of caffeine on RPE cell
monolayer is likely to be mediated through the antagonism ofA2AR. This study provides a potential innovative drug fordiabetic macular edema (DME). Nevertheless, another studycarried out on chick embryo retinas showed that caffeineexposure raised A2AR expression at 18 and 24 h, whiledecreased A2AR expression after 48 h ( Brito et al., 2016 ).
Retinas exposed to caffeine had increased levels ofphosphorylated extracellula r signal-regulated kinase and
cAMP-response element bind ing protein, but decreased
protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, calbindin and
choline acetyltransferase ( Brito et al., 2016 ). Such
m o d u l a t o r yr o l eo fc a f f e i n ei nr e t i n a sm i g h tb ed i r e c t l yassociated with regulation of adenosine system, as well asdifferent neurotransmitter systems. To further con ﬁrm the
protective effect of caffeine is mediated by antagonism on AR,future works are needed to evaluate the caffeine ’s effect on
expression of AR and AR-associated downstreameffector genes.
Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is responsible for ∼9% of all cases of blindness worldwide
(Stahl, 2020 ). The disease is characte rized by pathological
alteration in the RPE and loss of photoreceptor cell ( Stahl,
2020 ). Activation of P2X7R induces extracellular Ca2+inﬂux
and lysosomal alkalinization in the RPE leading to apoptosis
and degeneration ( Yang et al., 2011 ;Fletcher, 2020 ). In wet
AMD with sub-retinal hemorrhage , the release of extracellular
ATP induced severe photoreceptor cell loss and the vitreoussamples of AMD patients show ed higher extracellular ATP
levels. All hallmarks of photoreceptor cell apoptosis wereprevented by a selective P2X7R antagonist BBG ( Notomi
et al., 2011 ,2013 ), encouraging the potential application of
BBG as a neuroprotective agent in retinal degeneration linked
to excessive extracellular ATP. Stimulation of A2AR withspeci ﬁc agonists CGS21680 can reacidify damaged
lysosomes ( Liu et al., 2008 ). Nevertheless, A2AR antagonist,
SCH58261 decreases upregula tion of the expression of pro-
inﬂammatory mediators in human microglial cells, as well as
decreases the in ﬂammatory response, ult imately increasing
the clearance of apoptotic photoreceptor cells ( Madeira et al.,
2018 ).CONCLUSION
In this review, current information on the roles of extracellular
ATP and adenosine involved in the pathophysiological processeswithin retina demonstrated that extracellular ATP acts as aneurotransmitter while adenosine exerts an inhibitoryinﬂuence on retinal neuron by modulating excitatory
glutaminergic signaling. Very large concentrations ofextracellular ATP cause cell death while adenosine promotescell survival in retinal neural cells and RPE cells. What ’s more,
extracellular ATP and adenosine balance lysosomal activity in
RPE cells, as well as Müller cells volume; pro-in ﬂammatory ATP
and immunosuppressive adenosine maintain retinal microgliaactivation linked to neuroin ﬂammation and retinal degeneration.
Once excessive, extracellular ATP released from retinal cellsduring in ﬂammation, oxidative and osmotic stress, ischemic
hypoxia, mechanical stimulation, and cell injury aggravatedthe development of AMD, glaucoma, and DR.
Based on the commonly harmful role of extracellular ATP
and the protective role of adenosine described above, it iswell established that inhibition of P2 receptors or activation of
P1 receptors are possible way to treat retinal diseases. In
particular, P2X7-targeted therapy protects retinal cells fromdegeneration and the P2X7 antagonist BBG is an approvedadjuvant in ocular surgery. Selective agonists of ARs, especiallyA1R and A3R which prevent in ﬂammation, neuronal
hyperexcitation and P2X7 activation, are demonstrated bymultiple studies in vitro or vivo to lower intraocular pressure,
reduce neuroin ﬂammation and apoptosis. However, con ﬂicting
data are available regarding a potential use of A2A antagonistsfor the protection from retinal degeneration. Bene ﬁcial or
male ﬁcent effects of caffeine, a nonselective antagonist of
A2AR, have been demonstrated by different studies dependent
on different time windows of caffeine response or animaldevelopment phase, even though available study proposed thatcaffeine could be considered as innovative therapeutic drug formacular edema.
However, what is the role of other purinergic receptors in
retina and retinal diseases remains unclear. For instance, manydrugs targeting purine metabolism or purinergic signaling havebeen developed. The US FDA database shows that severalapproved purinergic signaling target-related drugs, includingadenosine and caffeine citrate injection, are mainly used in the
cardiovascular system ( Huang et al., 2021 ). In addition,
Gefapixant (AF-219) (P2X3R antagonist) is used for thechronic cough. However, the dinucleotide Up4U (diuridinetetraphosphate), marketed Diquas (P2Y2R agonist), is theonly drug used in clinical practice for ocular diseases (dryeye). Notably, P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) antagonists havebeen widely used as platelet inhibitors to preventthromboembolism. But currently no clinical trials on the useof P2Y12 antagonists in retinal disease have been performedeven though P2Y12 antagonists could be helpful to retinalmicrovascular disorders in DR. It is worthy of further studyand discussion.
ATP and adenosine acting independently as receptor
ligands, are interrelated as adenosine is a hydrolytic product
