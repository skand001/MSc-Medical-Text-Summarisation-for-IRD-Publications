Inherited retinal disease is a common cause of visual impairment and represents a highly heterogeneous group of conditions. Here, we
present ﬁndings from a cohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease, who have had whole-genome sequencing (n ¼605),
whole-exome sequencing (n ¼72), or both (n ¼45) performed, as part of the NIHR-BioResource Rare Diseases research study. We identiﬁed
pathogenic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, or structural variants) for 404/722 (56%) individuals. Whole-genome sequencing
gives unprecedented power to detect three categories of pathogenic variants in particular: structural variants, variants in GC-rich regions,
which have signiﬁcantly improved coverage compared to whole-exome sequencing, and variants in non-coding regulatory regions. Inaddition to previously reported pathogenic regulatory variants, we have identiﬁed a previously unreported pathogenic intronic variant
inCHM in two males with choroideremia. We have also identiﬁed 19 genes not previously known to be associated with inherited
retinal disease, which harbor biallelic predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved cases. Whole-genome sequencing is an increasinglyimportant comprehensive method with which to investigate the genetic causes of inherited retinal disease.
Introduction
Inherited retinal disease (IRD) describes a phenotypically
heterogeneous group of conditions consequent upon
dysfunction and/or degeneration of the neural retina or
retinal pigment epithelium, resulting in visual impairment.IRD is the most common cause of severe visual impairmentamong working-age individuals in the UK.
1Determining
the genetic cause of IRD in affected individuals allows accu-rate assessment of risk of the disease to other family mem-bers, provides useful prognostic information for affectedindividuals, and can provide much-needed insight and un-
derstanding of the disease for those affected. Furthermore,
genetic stratiﬁcation of affected individuals is increasinglybeing used to direct speciﬁc treatment options, includingclinical trials of medicines and restoration of protein func-
tion through gene therapy trials.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of large cohorts of indi-
viduals has transformed research into rare Mendelian dis-eases in recent years by facilitating discovery of pathogenicvariants, newly described disease-associated genes, andother insights into the genetic architecture of rare dis-eases.
3–5Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has thus far
typically been employed on a smaller scale and has demon-
strated advantages over other methods.6,7Large-scale
projects such as the Genomics England 100,000 GenomeProject are also beginning to use WGS to investigate rarediseases.
IRD represents a particularly good clinical phenotype to
provide comprehensive investigation by high-throughput

The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017 75/C2112017sequencing technologies because it exhibits a high degree
of phenotypic, genetic, and allelic heterogeneity, withmore than 250 genes and loci associated with autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, X-linked, and mitochon-drial inheritance (RetNet), and it is often difﬁcult to predictthe disease-associated gene from an individual’s pheno-type alone.
8IRD is therefore among the many rare diseases
that are increasingly being investigated through high-
throughput sequencing.9–12These technologies are also
transforming clinical practice by being incorporated intodiagnostic services.
13,14Most of these studies have used
targeted pull-down of a predetermined panel of knowngenes, which are limited not only in that they cover onlycertain genes, but also because they cannot reliably detectstructural variants (SVs). WES, on the other hand, is not
limited to known disease-associated genes, but coverage
is generally variable across the exome, negatively affectingvariant detection compared to targeted gene paneltesting.
15PCR-free WGS should overcome the disadvan-
tages of WES and targeted gene panels, although the re-maining challenge will be in handling the large amountof data generated and variant interpretation. Indeed, arecent study compared WGS to targeted gene panels and
found that WGS improves the pathogenic variant detec-
tion rate by facilitating detection of SVs and variants inregulatory regions.
16
The aims of the current study were three-fold. First, to
identify pathogenic variants in a large cohort of individ-uals with IRD, including intractable cases in which previ-ous investigations had not yielded a diagnosis. Second,to explore advantages and disadvantages of WGS as a
tool with which to investigate IRD. Third, to identify
candidate IRD-associated genes and provide new insightsinto phenotypes and the genetic architecture of IRD.Here we present a cohort of 722 individuals with IRDwho have had high-throughput sequencing as part of theNIHR-BioResource Rare Diseases research study.
Subjects and Methods
Cohort
722 individuals with IRD were recruited to the NIHR BioResource
Rare Diseases research study. All participants provided written
informed consent and the study was approved by the East ofEngland Cambridge South national institutional review board
(13/EE/0325). Most of the individuals (n ¼657) were recruited
at the Inherited Eye Disease clinics, Moorﬁelds Eye Hospital NHSFoundation Trust (London, UK). The remainder were recruited at
Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Cam-
bridge, UK), Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHSFoundation Trust (London, UK), Guy’s And St Thomas’ NHS Foun-dation Trust (London, UK), London North West Healthcare NHS
Trust (London, UK), and University College London Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK).
Most individuals had undergone some previous genetic testing
using routine diagnostic approaches: direct Sanger sequencing of
highly suggestive genes based on clinical characteristics, directsequencing of candidate genes in gene discovery projects, andarrayed primer extension (APEX, Asper Biotech Ltd.) assays for
retinitis pigmentosa (MIM: 268000) and Leber congenital amau-
rosis (LCA [MIM: 204000]). Individuals with no likely pathogenic
variant detected by these methods were recruited to the studyalthough systematic documentation of pre-screening of all caseswas not available. 152 individuals of the cohort had no pre-
screening performed.
High-Throughput Sequencing
WES and WGS were performed as previously described.17,18
Genome build GRCh37 was used for mapping and variant calling.
SVs were identiﬁed in the individuals who had WGS using twoindependent algorithms: Isaac Copy Number Variant Caller(Canvas, Illumina), which identiﬁes copy number gains and dele-
tions based on read depth, and Isaac Structural Variant Caller
(Manta, Illumina), which identiﬁes translocations, deletions, tan-dem duplications, insertions, and inversions based on both paired
read fragment spanning and split read evidence.
19
To identify the likely ethnicity of each individual, a principal-
component analysis was performed on WGS data from individuals
of various ethnicities in the 1000 Genomes project with 20,000
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) using PLINK.20The location of
the center of the cluster of each ethnicity was then calculated,and a likely ethnicity assigned to each of the WGS samples based
on the closest cluster.
Variant Interpretation
To facilitate variant interpretation, a list of reported IRD-associatedgenes was assembled, including genes associated with syndromic
forms of IRD or albinism, from various sources including RetNetand literature searches. This list was manually curated accordingto published evidence of pathogenicity to compile a shortlist of
224 high-conﬁdence IRD-associated genes ( Table S1 ).
21
To identify pathogenic variants, a two-step variant ﬁltering pro-
tocol was designed, utilizing automated ﬁltering followed by
manual review. For SNVs and indels, automated ﬁltering identiﬁed
variants that fulﬁl the following criteria: passes standard Illuminaquality ﬁlters in >80% of the whole NIHR BioResource Rare Dis-
eases cohort (n ¼6,688); predicted to be a high impact, medium
impact, or splice region variant, or present in the HGMD Pro data-base;
22and has minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 in control
datasets including the NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases cohort
and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database.23If a
variant is present in the HGMD Pro database, a higher MAFthreshold of 0.1 was used. Finally, we identiﬁed just those variants
that affect an IRD-associated gene. In one individual (G002628)
with hypomagnesemia and retinitis pigmentosa, we interrogatedknown hypomagnesemia-associated genes in addition to IRD-
associated genes. For SVs in the WGS data, automated ﬁltering
identiﬁed variants that fulﬁl the following criteria: passes standardIllumina quality ﬁlters, overlaps at least one exon, does not over-
lap known benign SVs in healthy cohorts,
24has MAF <0.01 in
the NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases cohort, and affects an IRD-associated gene.
Manual review of all the variants that passed the automated
ﬁltering was then performed. The variant is considered to be path-
ogenic if it fulﬁls the following criteria. First, the genotype and fre-quency of the variant is consistent with the expected mode of in-
heritance of the individual’s family (if known) and with the
expected mode of inheritance of the gene. Second, the phenotypeof the individual is consistent with the phenotype known to be
76 The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017associated with the gene. Third, the variant is predicted to result in
truncation of the protein, or it is predicted to be damaging to the
protein using scores such as CADD,25or it has previously been re-
ported as pathogenic in HGMD Pro. Fourth, the variant appears tobe of good quality upon examination of the sequencing reads withIntegrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).
26Fifth, the variant affects the
Ensembl canonical transcript or a known retinal transcript.
Variant Conﬁrmations
A subset of the pathogenic SNVs and indels was conﬁrmed by
Sanger sequencing using standard protocols. For SVs, Sangersequencing was performed across the predicted breakpoints to
generate a unique junction fragment sequence. Genotyping using
HumanCoreExome-24 v.1.0 BeadChip (Illumina) was also per-formed, followed by SV identiﬁcation using GenomeStudio and
cnvPartition software (Illumina). Sequences of all primers are
available on request.
Comparing Coverage of WGS and WES Datasets
Protein-coding regions of the Ensembl canonical transcript of eachautosomal IRD-associated gene were split into 50 bp bins. Themean GC% of each bin was calculated using data available from
the UCSC Genome Browser. The mean coverage of each bin was
calculated across a sample of 100 individuals with IRD in theNIHR BioResource Rare Diseases cohort (WGS data) and also in
the ExAC cohort, for which per-base coverage has been previously
published on 10% of the cohort.
23We used the ExAC WES dataset
for the comparison of the coverage of IRD-associated genes, ratherthan the WES data generated as part of this study, because ExAC
was used as a frequency control set in this study and because it
is based on >60,000 individuals.
Coverage data are presented as relative to the mean coverage of
all bins (34.4 3in the WGS dataset and 65.6 3in ExAC). Coverage
for each observed range of GC content (20%–30%, 30%–40%,40%–50%, 50%–60%, 60%–70%, 70%–80%, and 80%–90%) was
compared using one-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests. p values were
corrected for testing of seven observed ranges of GC content.
Variant Analysis in CHM
Two individuals with a clinical diagnosis of choroideremia
(MIM: 303100) in whom no pathogenic coding variant wasfound underwent intronic variant analysis of CHM ([MIM:
300390]; ENST00000357749.2, GRCh37/hg19 chrX: 85,116,185–
85,302,566). Intronic variants in CHM that passed standard qual-
ity ﬁlters and had a MAF %0.01 in the UK10K WGS cohort and
the NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases cohort were prioritized for
analysis. Splice site prediction of the reference and alternate se-quences were compared using Human Splice Finder V3.0 (HSF)
and NNSPLICE0.9.
27,28We identiﬁed a candidate variant that
was conﬁrmed by direct Sanger sequencing of genomic DNAfrom affected members of both families and an obligate carrier.Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) spanning CHM exons 4–5
was carried out on total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells.
Identiﬁcation of Genes Containing Likely Biallelic
Predicted Protein-Truncating Variants in UnsolvedCases
Variants (SNVs, indels, and large deletions) were identiﬁed that ful-
ﬁl the following criteria: in an unsolved case where an individualhas undergone WGS, are high impact and autosomal, the genotypeis consistent with autosomal-recessive inheritance, have MAF <
0.001 in the control datasets described, are in the Ensembl canon-
ical transcript, are in a gene that contains no homozygous predicted
protein-truncating variants in the ExAC database, and appear to bereal on examination in IGV. This analysis was not limited to IRD-associated genes, but included all protein-coding genes.
Results
In a Highly Heterogeneous Cohort of Individuals with
Inherited Retinal Disease, High-ThroughputSequencing Achieves a Pathogenic Variant DetectionRate of 56%High-throughput sequencing was performed on a cohortof 722 individuals with IRD, as part of the NIHR-Bio-
Resource Rare Diseases research study. 605 of the individ-
uals had WGS, 72 had WES, and an additional 45 hadboth. For WGS average coverage was 37 3(SD¼2.7),
with a minimum of 95% of each genome covered to at least153. For WES average target coverage was 43 3(SD¼14.9),
with 83% of target bases covered to at least 15 3.
The cohort is phenotypically heterogeneous, and the
most frequent phenotypes are retinitis pigmentosa
(n¼311), retinal dystrophy (n ¼101), cone-rod dystrophy
(n¼53), Stargardt disease (n ¼45), macular dystrophy
(n¼37), and Usher syndrome (n ¼37). The majority of in-
dividuals are unrelated probands (714/722), and there arethree parent-offspring pairs and one pair of siblings. The ma-jority of the cohort had a negative result for a genetic test,such as single-gene Sanger sequencing or targeted genepanel sequencing, prior to enrolment in the current study.
To identify the pathogenic variants, rare, coding, and
high-quality variants, including large deletions, in 224genes that are known to be associated with IRD wereconsidered. The likely cause of IRD was identiﬁed in 404/722 individuals, corresponding to a pathogenic variantdetection rate of 56% ( Tables 1 andS2). A further 5% of in-
dividuals (36/722) have been classiﬁed as partially solved.These individuals either have a single likely pathogenic
variant in a known gene associated with recessive IRD
and in keeping with the individual’s phenotype, morethan two heterozygous variants in a gene associated withrecessive IRD, or a variant that explains only part of thephenotype ( Table S2 ). The remaining 282/722 (39%) of in-
dividuals remain without a complete or partial moleculardiagnosis.
By using WES alone we were able to identify pathogenic
variants in 59/117 (50%) individuals. Subsequently, 45 of
the 58 individuals who were unsolved by WES underwentWGS, and we identiﬁed or conﬁrmed pathogenic variantsin a further 14 ( Table 1 ). For three individuals the bait for
the variant location was absent from the capture kit (RocheNimbleGen, SeqCap EZ Exome v.3), for two individualseach had a large deletion not called by WES, and in one in-dividual, a large indel was also not called by WES. For three
more individuals, the variant was called by WES but the
quality was poor. For the remaining ﬁve individuals,
The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017 77although the variants were identiﬁed by WES, they were
not the expected mode of inheritance for the family, andtherefore WGS was performed to exclude more plausiblecause of disease by including analysis of copy-number var-iants and exons of high GC content.
The pathogenic variant detection rate also varies de-
pending on the phenotype of the individual ( Table 2 ).
For example, 168/311 (54%) of individuals with retinitis
pigmentosa have been solved, which is similar to the over-
all rate; 31/37 (84%) of individuals with Usher syndromehave been solved but only 6/21 (29%) of individualswith cone dystrophy have been solved. Also, individualswho had not had any genetic test prior to this study hada notably higher pathogenic variant detection rate thanthe overall rate. Of 152 individuals who had no pre-screening, including individuals with a diagnosis of reti-
nitis pigmentosa, cone dystrophy, or congenital stationary
night blindness, 96 were solved (63%), suggesting that ourcohort is enriched for intractable cases.
The pathogenic variant detection rate within our cohort
also varies depending on the ethnicity of the individual(Table 3 ). Likely ethnicity was estimated from the WGS
data. Only 13/43 (30%) of individuals of African ancestrywere solved, compared to 259/467 (55%) of individuals
of European ancestry and 70/123 (57%) of individuals of
South Asian ancestry. Higher genetic diversity in Africanpopulations, combined with underrepresentation of non-European populations in control datasets, result in anexcess of rare and apparently rare variation in theseindividuals, rendering variant interpretation more chal-lenging.
23,29There was a median of 12 rare coding variants
in IRD-associated genes for manual review in individuals of
European ancestry and 30 in individuals of African
ancestry. Interestingly, in individuals of South Asianancestry, 59/89 pathogenic variants (66%) were homozy-gous, compared to only 82/446 (18%) in individuals ofEuropean ancestry. This is likely due to increased rates ofconsanguinity in South Asian populations, and probablyexplains why they have comparable pathogenic variantdetection rates to individuals of European ancestry in
this study, despite also being underrepresented in control
databases of allele frequencies.The genes in which pathogenic variants are most
frequently found are summarized in Table 4 .ABCA4
(MIM: 601691) is implicated in 73/440 solved or partially
solved cases (17%). In total, 796 pathogenic alleles wereidentiﬁed in 95 different known IRD-associated genes. Ofthese alleles, 687 (86.3%) are autosomal recessive, 72(9%) are autosomal dominant, 35 (4.4%) are X-linkedhemizygous, and 2 (0.3%) are X-linked monoallelic.Some of the pathogenic alleles are homozygous, andsome occur in more than one individual in the cohort,
thus there are 537 different pathogenic alleles. Of these,
499 (92.9%) are exonic SNVs or indels, 30 (5.6%) are largedeletions overlapping at least one exon, 6 (1.1%) are SNVsor indels that are synonymous or in regulatory regions,and 2 (0.4%) are tandem duplications overlapping at leastone exon. 291/537 (54.2%) are previously unreported inpublically available databases emphasizing the allelic het-erogeneity of IRD, and the rest have been previously re-
ported and are in the HGMD Pro database.
22
We performed conﬁrmatory Sanger sequencing and
segregation in families in a subset of variants. Of 177 allelesSanger sequenced, all were conﬁrmed. Of these, 52 weretested in at least one additional informative family mem-ber, and segregated as expected. In ﬁve of the individualswhose case is unsolved, a pathogenic variant was identiﬁedby a different method concurrent to this study. Four of
these are variants in highly repetitive regions requiring
speciﬁc optimized Sanger sequencing protocols, forTable 1. Pathogenic Variant Detection Rates by Sequencing

Pathogenic Structural Variants Are an Important
Cause of IRD, and Their Detection Is Facilitated
by WGS
There are 33 SVs (31 deletions and 2 tandem duplications)that are pathogenic in 31 individuals ( Table S2 ). Each SV
was further investigated using either SNP genotypingarray, direct Sanger sequencing of a unique PCR ampliﬁedproduct spanning the predicted breakpoints, or bothtechniques. 23 (70%) have been conﬁrmed by Sangersequencing of the breakpoint, 6 (18%) have been
conﬁrmed by both Sanger sequencing the breakpoint
and SNP genotyping array, 2 (6%) have been conﬁrmedby genotyping only, and 2 (6%) have not yet beenconﬁrmed by an alternative method, although visual in-spection of the IGV plots predict a deletion. In sevenSVs, conﬁrmatory Sanger sequencing of PCR generatedproducts over the breakpoint also revealed an insertion(1–51 bps) at the breakpoint of the variants predicted by
the algorithms.
The Manta algorithm, which identiﬁes structural vari-
ants based on both paired read fragment spanning andsplit read evidence, predicts the correct breakpoints with100% accuracy in 13/26 SVs that were called by Mantaand have been conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. It predictsthe correct breakpoints to within 3 bp in 21/26 SVs. Inter-estingly, we have identiﬁed one identical SV in two unre-
lated individuals. G001296 and W000139 both have 15:
89,750,128–89,757,489del, which overlaps exons 7–9 ofRLBP1 (MIM: 180090). In G001296 the deletion is hetero-
zygous and occurs in conjunction with a second patho-genic variant, and in W000139 it is homozygous. It doesnot occur in any other individual in the NIHR BioResourceRare Diseases cohort.
Case study one illustrates the power of WGS to
detect SVs. Two likely pathogenic heterozygous vari-
ants were identiﬁed in EYS (MIM: 612424) in indivi-dual W000325, who presented with typical retinitis
pigmentosa. The variants are a missense variantENST00000503581.1; c.6473T >C (p.Leu2158Pro) that is
predicted to be damaging by CADD (phred-scaledCADD score ¼23.5) and has not been reported
before in public databases, and a 55 kb deletion
(chr6: 65,602,819–65,658,187del), conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing, which overlaps exons 15–18 (c.2260-2380_2847-6084del). If transcribed, this large deletionis predicted to lead to a frameshift and premature termi-nation in exon 19 (p.Arg949Ilefs*4). This individual hadundergone WES analysis prior to WGS analysis, fromwhich it was not possible to identify the pathogenic dele-tion ( Figure 1 ).
Case study two is an interesting example of likely unipa-
rental isodisomy discovered through analysis of SVs. Indi-vidual W000170 presented with an atypical early-onsetform of retinal dystrophy. A homozygous in-frame combi-nation indel in KCNV2 (MIM: 607604) was ﬁrst identiﬁed:

ual is heterozygous for this indel, and the father is
homozygous for the reference allele. By visual inspectionTable 3. Pathogenic Variant Detection Rate by Ethnicity

homozygous tandem duplication was identiﬁed (chr9:
2,717,844–2,718,030dup), ﬂanking the indel ( Figure 2 ),
which was conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Further inves-tigation revealed a long run of homozygosity with approx-imate coordinates chr9: 2,100,000–27,400,000. Takentogether, we consider that the most likely explanation forthese observations is homozygosity for the KCNV2 disease
allele due to partial maternal uniparental isodisomy of
chromosome 9.
Case study three is an interesting example of overlap-
ping compound heterozygous deletions. IndividualW000164 presented with typical retinitis pigmentosa.Two likely pathogenic overlapping heterozygous dele-tions were identiﬁed by WGS. The ﬁrst (chr6:64,475,599–64,501,270del) encompasses exons 38–40 ofEYS and the second (chr6: 64,491,812–64,513,698del)
encompasses exons 38–39 of EYS (Figure 3 ). Sanger
sequencing conﬁrmed both deletions. This example illus-trates the value of algorithms that use paired read frag-ment spanning evidence such as Manta. Only these areable to provide characterization of breakpoints to a singlebase pair resolution. WES or indeed read depth analysisalone of WGS (e.g., the Canvas algorithm) would failto characterize the breakpoints precisely, rendering
Sanger sequencing conﬁrmation or family analysis
more difﬁcult.
Figure 1. Case Study 1: WGS, Compared
to WES, Increases Power to Detect SVs(A) One individual (W000325) withretinitis pigmentosa has a pathogenic
heterozygous deletion within EYS
(6:656,02,819–65,658,187). IGV plotsshowing the deleted region in both WGS
and WES data in the individual. The dele-
tion was identiﬁed by WGS due to thedrop in coverage and increased distance
between mate-paired reads. However, it
was not identiﬁed from WES data.(B) The individual also has a pathogenicmissense variant ENST00000503581.1;
c.6473T >C (p.Leu2158Pro).
WGS Improves Coverage of GC-
Rich Regions Compared to WESIn the current study, we haveobserved increased power to detectvariants in GC-rich regions. To assessthe possible impact of this, we calcu-lated the average coverage of exonsof known IRD-associated genes, split
into 50 bp bins, in our WGS dataset
and in the ExAC WES dataset. Forexons of IRD-associated genes with aGC content of 45%–65%, the averagecoverage by read depth of sequenceusing WES is higher than for WGS.The calling of SNV exonic variants
in this range is not signiﬁcantly different for WES and
WGS. Comparing WES from ExAC, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly
higher coverage in our WGS dataset in bins with GC <
30% or >70% ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, the variability of
coverage in our WGS data is much less than that of theExAC dataset. This uniformity of coverage is one of themain factors that make WGS particularly powerful for SVdetection. Calling SVs in WES where the variance of readdepth is so great is unreliable ( Figure 1 A).
Case study four illustrates the clinical relevance of this
improvement in coverage. Individual G004991 presentedwith Leber congenital amaurosis. Pathogenic compoundheterozygous variants were identiﬁed in the ﬁrst codingexon of GUCY2D (MIM: 600179), which is 76% GC
(Figure 5 ). The variants are an in-frame deletion
(ENST00000254854.4; c.238_252delGCCGCCGCCCGCCTG [p.Ala80_Leu84del]) not previously reported in
publically available databases and a previously re-
ported missense variant (ENST00000254854.4; c.307G >A
[p.Glu103Lys]).
30This exon is not covered in the capture
kit used for WES, and had WES been used rather thanWGS to investigate this individual, neither pathogenicvariant would have been identiﬁed. Furthermore, visual in-spection of the sequencing reads using IGV demonstratesbiallelic inheritance of the two variants, since they occur
within 70 nucleotides and are never observed on the
same 150 bp read.

One individual (W000170) with atypical, early-onset retinal dystrophy, has a homozygous pathogenic tandem duplication withinKCNV2 , likely due to partial maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 9.

nates of this region of homozygosity are 9:2,100,000–27,400,000.

ValThrThrThrLeu). The mother of the affected individual is heterozygous for this variant, but the father is homozygous for the reference
allele (not shown).
The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017 81WGS Allows Identiﬁcation of Pathogenic Variants in
Non-coding RegionsIn our cohort, three different pathogenic non-coding SNVs
were identiﬁed. For example, in G008165, who presented
with Stargardt disease, one intronic SNV was identiﬁed inABCA4 intrans with a previously reported synonymous
SNV , 1:94466602C >T (ENST00000370225.3; c.6342G >A),
that results in a premature donor splice site that truncatesexon 46.
31The heterozygous intronic variant was
1:94476951A >G (ENST00000370225.3; c.5461 /C010T>C),
which has also been previously reported and causes aber-
rant splicing.32This variant was found in 16 individuals,
all of whom presented with typical features of ABCA4 reti-
nopathy, and thus represents a signiﬁcant portion of diseasealleles. In two of these individuals this variant is homozy-gous, in a further nine individuals it occurs in conjunctionwith a second heterozygous likely pathogenic allele, and inﬁve, we have identiﬁed no second likely pathogenic alleleand the individuals remain partially solved. This variant is
rare in both ExAC (MAF ¼2.2310
/C04,n oh o m o z y g o t e s )
and the whole NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases cohort(MAF¼1.8310
/C03, no homozygotes other than the two
described here).
In another example, individual G001035, who presented
with Usher syndrome, the deep intronic USH2A (MIM:
608400) variant 1:216064540T >C (ENST00000307340.3;
c.7595 /C02144A >G) was identiﬁed. This is heterozygous
and occurs in conjunction with a second heterozygous
likely pathogenic allele. It has been previously reported,and results in the retention of a pseudoexon, which causes
a frameshift and premature truncation of the protein.33
Finally, in two unrelated males with a clinical diagnosis
of choroideremia (G001372 and G007713), we identiﬁed
a deep intronic variant in CHM that has not been previ-
ously reported. Both individuals had previously undergoneCHM screens, which were negative, and no convincing
pathogenic coding variant was found in any IRD-associ-ated gene in either individual upon analysis of the WGSdata. Given the unequivocal diagnosis of choroideremiain these individuals and the single genetic cause of choroi-
deremia, the sequence of these case subjects was selected
for interrogation of rare non-coding variants in CHM
(chrX: 85,116,185–85,302,566). We hypothesized that adeep intronic variant may act as a null variant by alteringsplicing as previously described.
34
A rare (MAF %0.01) deep intronic hemizygous variant
was identiﬁed in G001372 in the genomic region ofCHM : chrX: 85,220,593T >C (ENST00000357749.2;
c.315–1536A >G). Individual G007713 had three rare in-
tronic variants, including the same chrX: 85,220,593T >C
variant. This variant is absent in the UK10K genome proj-ect dataset and the 1000 Genomes dataset.
29,35The variant
was conﬁrmed in both individuals by direct Sangersequencing, and it was also conﬁrmed in an affectedmale cousin of G007713 and in the heterozygous state inthe mother of G007713.
Splice prediction analysis using HSF

demonstrated the likely introduction of a cryptic splice
Figure 3. Case Study 3: Identiﬁcation and Characterization of Compound Heterozygous Deletions in EYSby WGS

(B) Sanger sequencing conﬁrmed both deletions. Sequencing across the breakpoint (vertical dashed line) of deletion 2 is shown.
82 The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017acceptor site by this variant (HSF consensus value: 92.66,
NNSPLICE0.9 score 0.94). The presence of a strong donorsite (HSF consensus value: 84.71, NNSPLICE0.9 score: 0.89,sequence atgcaag gtaaactg) 224 bp downstream of the
cryptic acceptor site suggested that a cryptic exon could arise
from this variant ( Figure 6 ).
To conﬁrm this, we used RT-PCR ampliﬁcation spanning
exons 4–5 of CHM from G001372, G007713, and the
heterozygous mother of G007713. This demonstrated afragment approximately 200 bp larger than expected (2fragments in the heterozygous mother). Upon sequencingof the fragments, the predicted cryptic exon was
conﬁrmed. The variant is predicted to lead to a premature
termination codon after 9 altered amino acid residues(p.Ser105Argfs*10).
Monoallelic Variants in Genes Associated with a
Recessive Mode of InheritanceInterpreting single heterozygous variants in recessive IRD-associated genes presents a challenge, as it is typically difﬁ-
cult to distinguish between a case in which a second path-
ogenic allele in the same gene has been missed from a casein which the individual is just a carrier of the single hetero-zygous variant and the real cause of disease lies elsewhere.In our cohort there are only 16 individuals (2%) who havea single heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in a reces-sive IRD-associated gene. Of these, 12 are in ABCA4 and
one is in each of CEP290 (MIM: 610142), CNGB1 (MIM:
600724), GUCY2D , and CRB1 (MIM: 604210). These indi-
viduals all have phenotypes that are strongly indicativeof variants in the gene in question, and the identiﬁed
variant in each case is either a predicted protein-truncatingvariant or a missense previously reported as being patho-genic. We excluded the possibility that these individualshave an additional previously reported pathogenic deepintronic variant. The probability is high that at leastsome of these 16 partially solved individuals harbor a sec-
ond pathogenic variant in the same gene, perhaps in a reg-
ulatory region, that remains elusive. This cohort is undercontinuing investigation to identify further variants,including variants in regulatory regions. The proportionof individuals who have a single likely pathogenic variantin an autosomal-recessive gene in this study is lower thanpreviously reported (2%).
16This may reﬂect a combination
of detailed specialist phenotyping to reduce phenocopies
and the comprehensive exon and non-coding coverage
achieved using WGS.
Identiﬁcation of Genes Containing Likely Biallelic
Predicted Protein-Truncating Variants in UnsolvedCasesWe performed further investigation of 247 individuals, inwhom no pathogenic variants were detected in the knownIRD-associated genes, and whose family history is not
inconsistent with recessive disease. These were screened
for any gene containing R2 predicted protein-truncating
alleles, including SVs. This yielded a list of 19 genes in 16individuals ( Tables 5 and S3). None occurred in more
than one individual, but three individuals have variantsin two genes. Segregation has not been performed on thedouble heterozygous variants. None of these genes containany homozygous predicted protein-truncating variants in
the ExAC dataset, suggesting that they may not tolerate
biallelic loss-of-function variation.
Discussion
Overall, we have identiﬁed pathogenic variants for 404/
722 individuals with IRD in the NIHR-BioResource Rare
Diseases study, which is a pathogenic variant detectionrate of 56%. Factors that inﬂuence this rate within ourcohort include the phenotype of the individual, forexample individuals with Usher syndrome are substan-tially more likely to receive a molecular diagnosis than in-dividuals with retinitis pigmentosa. There are severalpossible reasons for this. First, it may be that a higher pro-
portion of Usher syndrome genes overall have been identi-
ﬁed than retinitis pigmentosa genes. Second, more speciﬁcphenotypes can suggest a smaller number of candidategenes; retinitis pigmentosa is far more genetically hetero-geneous than Usher syndrome. Third, it is more difﬁcultto distinguish pathogenic monoallelic variants from themany rare benign inherited monoallelic variants than itis to distinguish pathogenic biallelic variation; therefore,
phenotypes that are predominantly recessive tend to
have higher pathogenic variant detection rates. Also, it

The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017 83may be that individuals with some phenotypes were more
likely to undergo some pre-screening prior to enrolment inthe project, which would exclude individuals with variantsin known genes and likely reduce the pathogenic variantdetection rate.
Our pathogenic variant detection rate of 56% with WGS
is comparable to those previously reported in other similarstudies of IRD, which ranges between 39% and 70%.
9–14,16
Factors that inﬂuence differences between these ratesinclude the technology used and the degree of pre-screening performed on the cohort, as well as the pheno-types included and the ethnic distribution of the cohortas discussed. Our detection rate of 50% using WES in 117individuals is perhaps lower than expected due to theWES depth of coverage of 43 3used compared to diag-
nostic laboratory median coverage of >803that is recom-
mended.
36Our observation that the subset of our cohort
who had no pre-screening had a higher pathogenic variantdetection rate than the overall rate suggests that our cohortis enriched for intractable cases and that the overall rate of56% is an underestimate compared with what would be ex-pected if WGS was used as the ﬁrst-line test.
We have observed that using primarily WGS instead of
WES or targeted gene panels has improved our power to
detect three categories of variants in particular: SVs, vari-
ants in GC-rich regions, and variants in regulatory regions.Previous studies have also observed that WGS is superior toWES for the detection of SVs, particularly small deletions(e.g., single exon deletions).
6,37,38This is due to high uni-
formity of coverage achieved with WGS and the veryhigh probability that the breakpoints of a SV will becovered by WGS reads. With WGS, therefore, precise char-
acterization of the SV to single base pair resolution is often
possible, without any further investigation.Our study also supports previous reports that PCR-free
sequencing protocols, such as WGS, capture genomic re-gions that are particularly high or low in GC contentmuch more effectively than methods such as WES and tar-geted gene panels, which require a PCR ampliﬁcationstep.
36,37GC-rich regions tend to be poorly covered by
methods that require a PCR ampliﬁcation step due totheir high stability and consequent resistance to standard
denaturation protocols, and variant calling suffers as a
consequence.
39–41
The WGS analysis identiﬁed three intronic variants that
would not have been identiﬁed by standard WES withoutspeciﬁc prior knowledge. The interpretation of these vari-ants required the availability of sequence from a largenumber of internal controls (~3,000 alleles from theNIHR BioResource Rare Diseases consortium) and external
WGS controls (~8,000 alleles from UK10K). Frequency data
on non-coding variants comparable to the ExAC datasetfor coding variants is needed and will transform rare dis-ease non-coding variant interpretation. Clinical WES plat-forms can be designed to target known pathogenic variantsin regulatory regions in addition to the exome footprint.
42
However, they require regular redesign to capture newly re-ported non-coding pathogenic variants, and they do not
give the option of identifying pathogenic deep intronic
variants that have not been previously reported.
Regarding limitations of WGS, highly repetitive regions
generally still remain poorly covered in our WGS data,due to the difﬁculty of uniquely mapping the reads inthese regions to the genome. This has previously been re-ported
16and is also a problem for targeted gene panels
and WES.12,13This is an important issue for IRD, due to
the existence of clinically important repetitive regions
such as RPGR ORF15 , which is highly repetitive and is a

which is 76% GC-rich. This exon is not covered by WES in our cohort, as demonstrated by the WES data of a control sample shown
here. It is also not well covered in ExAC.
84 The American Journal of Human Genetics 100, 75–90, January 5, 2017mutational hotspot that constitutes one of the most com-
mon causes of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.43Although
in the future increasing read lengths and improved readmapping algorithms are likely to result in improvedcoverage over these regions, currently they must still besequenced separately using optimized PCR ampliﬁcationand Sanger sequencing protocols to exclude the possibilityof them harboring pathogenic variants. WGS also remains
costlier than targeted gene panels or WES, and so currently
costs more per diagnosis.
44With the cost of WGS
continuing to fall and the emergence of large-scale WGSprojects such as the Genomics England 100,000 GenomeProject, WGS is an increasingly important tool for investi-gating genetic causes of rare diseases, including IRD, inclinical practice as well as research, and is likely to becomethe preferred ﬁrst-line test in the future.
45
This project has already contributed to novel insights
into the genetic architecture and phenotypic spectrum ofIRD. We have identiﬁed a distinctive electroretinogramphenotype, predominantly involving the cone pathways,in two individuals with variants in CACNA2D4 (MIM:
608171).
46Additionally, an individual from this study
with biallelic IFT140 (MIM: 614620) variants, along with
additional case subjects, expanded the known phenotypic
spectrum of IFT140 -associated disease, which was origi-
nally reported as a severe syndromic ciliopathy and isnow known to also cause non-syndromic retinitis pigmen-tosa.
18Several other individuals in our cohort with vari-
ants in both RGR (MIM: 600342) and CDHR1 (MIM:
609502) led to the discovery that a recessive retinal disor-der previously associated with a homozygous variant inRGR is more likely to be caused by the variant in CDHR1 ,
which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the orig-
inally reported variant.
47
There are many possible reasons why 282/722 (39%) of
our cohort remain as yet unsolved. Some may have patho-genic variants that have not been called by the variantcalling software because, for example, they are in regionsof poor coverage such as repetitive regions. Others mayhave pathogenic variants that were called but not manu-
ally reviewed because they did not pass one of our ﬁlters.
Some are likely to have pathogenic variants in genes asso-

ciated with IRD that are not on our
list of IRD-associated genes. Forsome unsolved individuals, the causeof their disease may be more complexthan Mendelian inheritance and may
be oligogenic or inﬂuenced by environmental factors.
Finally, it is likely that a proportion of unsolved individualshave pathogenic variants in regulatory regions, rather thanin coding exons. Regulatory variation is known to be animportant cause of IRD.
11,31,33,48,49Having used WGS
for the majority of our cohort, we are well placed toinvestigate this class of variation. However, interpretationof regulatory variation remains a signiﬁcant challenge.
Experimental veriﬁcation of speciﬁc variants is particularly
difﬁcult as many IRD-associated genes are restricted toexpression in the retina, making functional conﬁrmationof the effects of any candidate regulatory variation chal-lenging. Our investigation of potentially pathogenic regu-latory variation is ongoing.
We have identiﬁed 19 genes that contain likely biallelic,
predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved individ-
uals with IRD, including CROCC (MIM: 615776), IRX5
(MIM: 606195), and NUMB (MIM: 603728) that have
known roles in retinal development and function.
50,51
These may represent strong candidates for previouslyunreported recessive IRD-associated genes ( Table S3 ). Iden-
tiﬁcation of at least two additional individuals with likelypathogenic variants is necessary to provide sufﬁcient sup-portive evidence of any of these genes being associated
with IRD.
In conclusion, we present here a large cohort of indi-
viduals with IRD who have had WGS, and we haveachieved a pathogenic variant detection rate of 56%.We have identiﬁed three categories of pathogenic variantthat WGS substantially improves the detection of: SVs,variants in GC-rich regions, and variants in regulatory re-gions. Studying a cohort of this size using WGS provides
new insights into phenotypes and the genetic architec-
ture of IRD. In the future, WGS is likely to become thepreferred choice of test with which to investigate thegenetic causes of IRD.
