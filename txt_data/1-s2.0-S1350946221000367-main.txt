Gene therapy ABSTRACT  
Inherited and age-related retinal degeneration is the hallmark of a large group of heterogeneous diseases and is 
the main cause of untreatable blindness today. Genetic factors play a major pathogenic role in retinal de-
generations for both monogenic diseases (such as retinitis pigmentosa) and complex diseases with established 
genetic risk factors (such as age-related macular degeneration). Progress in genotyping techniques and back of 
the eye imaging are completing our understanding of these diseases and their manifestations in patient pop-
ulations suffering from retinal degenerations. It is clear that whatever the genetic cause, the majority of vision 
loss in retinal diseases results from the loss of photoreceptor function. The timing and circumstances surrounding 
the loss of photoreceptor function determine the adequate therapeutic approach to use for each patient. Among 
such approaches, gene therapy is rapidly becoming a therapeutic reality applicable in the clinic. This massive 
move from laboratory work towards clinical application has been propelled by the advances in our under -
standing of disease genetics and mechanisms, gene delivery vectors, gene editing systems, and compensatory 
strategies for loss of photoreceptor function. Here, we provide an overview of existing modalities of retinal gene 
therapy and their relevance based on the needs of patient populations suffering from inherited retinal 
degenerations.   
1.Introduction 
1.1. Why gene therapy? Why now? 
Gene therapy that is broadly defined as the use of exogenous DNA to 
treat human disease has been proposed as a potential medical inter-
vention over five decades ago (Aposhian, 1970 ). Gene therapy offers a 
theoretical advantage over small molecules classically used as medi -
cines: it is a one-shot treatment that can provide a durable and poten -
tially curative clinical benefit. The journey from concept to clinical 
application has been long, including the development of an experi -
mental approach around the identified medical needs. The first appli -
cations were evidently in vitro where cells to be genetically modified 
were removed from the body then re administered to patients( Fischer, 
Hacein-Bey-Abina and Cavazzana-Calvo, 2010 ). The development of gene delivery vectors has been the major bottleneck of this attractive 
strategy and remained problematic in the early clinical trials of the 
1990s revealing therapy-related toxicities such as inflammatory re-
sponses to the vectors and malignancies caused by vector-mediated 
insertional activation of proto-oncogenes( Dunbar et al., 2018 ). These 
setbacks fueled more basic research in virology, immunology, cell 
biology, model development, and target disease, that ultimately led to 
successful clinical translation of gene therapies in the 2000s. Gene 
therapy can now be carried out in vitro in patient cells or in vivo. In the 
second scenario, genetic materials need to be directly introduced into 
the target organs or tissues of the patients. 
Today, in vivo delivery of therapeutic AAV vectors to the retina, 
liver, and nervous system resulted in clinical improvement in patients 
with congenital blindness, hemophilia B, and spinal muscular atrophy, 
respectively( Dunbar et al., 2018 ). In the United States, Food and Drug

2Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals 
of the first gene therapy products occurred between 2017 and 2018, 
including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–T cells to treat B cell ma-
lignancies and AAV vectors for in vivo treatment of congenital blindness 
(Luxturna). Promising clinical trial results in spinal muscular atrophy 
and hemophilia also resulted in additional FDA approval since that time. 
Now is thus the right time to leverage these initial experiences of gene 
therapy to extremely rare diseases towards providing treatments in 
diseases affecting larger groups of patients. This review will outline 
strategies being explored in this direction and technologies needed for 
their successful translation. The ability of gene therapies to provide 
durable benefits to human health justifies continued optimism and 
increasing efforts towards making gene therapy part of our standard 
treatments especially in ophthalmology, where the eye presents clear 
advantages of being a small compartmentalized structure with immune 
privilege. 
1.2. What happens in retinal degeneration? 
Visual loss from retinal degeneration is the major cause of blindness 
in industrialized countries(Wright et al., 2010). Retinal degenerations 
represent a large and heterogenous group of diseases, with genetic 
mutations and susceptibility factors determining the disease pathogen -
esis and onset. The majority of vision loss in retinal degenerations, 
whatever the cause, ultimately results from the loss of photoreceptors. 
This loss can be due to genetic mutations that these cells carry or mu-
tations found in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Mendes et al., 
2005). These mutations can affect genes that are involved in photo -
transduction, biosynthesis and folding of the rhodopsin molecule, and 
the disruption of proteins providing structural support of the retina like 
those involved in Usher Syndrome(Daiger et al., 2013). The broadest 
category of inherited retinal degenerations is Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). 
Within RP, most frequent mutations are found on the rhodopsin gene 
affecting the function of rhodopsin and indirectly leading to other issues 
within rods(Audo, Manes, Mohand-Saïd, Friedrich, Lancelot, Antonio, 
Moskova-Doumanova, Poch, Zanlonghi, Christian P Hamel et al., 2010). 
One mechanism of retinal degeneration is rhodopsin overexpression or 
under-expression. Another mechanism, whereby a mutation causes a 
truncated rhodopsin, affects the cell’s ability to fold and traffic the 
protein leading to cell death via the unfolded protein response(Kunte 
et al., 2012). 
The other large group of diseases affecting photoreceptor survival 
consists of degenerations with proven genetic risk factors that make 
certain individuals more at risk of complex disease(Fritsche et al., 2013). 
In contrast to targeted replacement of single gene deficiencies that can 
be proposed in monogenic diseases described above, different strategies 
are required to treat these so-called complex photoreceptor de-
generations (like age related macular degeneration). For the purpose of 
this review, we will focus on monogenic inherited retinal dystrophies, 
for which, we now have a good understanding of the genetics and 
mechanisms. 
1.3. How can gene therapy help, prevent or cure visual loss caused by 
retinal degeneration? 
In principal, the most significant benefit from gene therapy can be 
obtained by replacing the mutant gene with a healthy copy or by cor-
recting the underlying mutation prior to degeneration of retinal cells. 
Some progressive diseases have a large window of opportunity where 
such interventions can be made prior to the loss of photoreceptors 
resulting in potentially lifetime benefit. Achromatopsia, where cones 
stay anatomically intact is another example. Other diseases such as 
congenital stationary night blindness where there is no degeneration but 
a functional loss at the bipolar cell level are excellent candidates for gene 
replacement or corrective therapies with a large therapeutic window 
(Zeitz et al., 2015; Cremers et al., 2018). On the other end of the spectrum, Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy affect the RGCs and most 
patients progress to vision worse than 20/200 within the first year after 
the disease onset severely restricting the therapeutic window of oppor -
tunity(Vignal-Clermont et al., 2015). However, in most cases of rod-cone 
dystrophy, once photoreceptors have started to degenerate, gene 
replacement or correction is uncertain to provide a life-long benefit as 
the degenerative process once underway may be difficult to halt. 
Moreover, there are many unknown and dominant mutations where 
gene replacement cannot be envisioned. In all such cases, benefit can be 
obtained via the secretion of survival factors delivered in form of gene 
therapy potentially in combination with gene replacement(Sahel and 
Roska, 2013). There are several varieties of survival-enhancing factors 
that can help with metabolic issues, inflammation and oxidative stress 
that arise in cones secondary to the loss of rods(Sahel et al., 2013). Once 
cones lose their outer segments, it is possible to restore light sensitivity 
in these cells via ectopic expression of microbial opsins (optogenetics). 
Such degenerated cones that have lost their outer segments or down -
stream neurons can be transduced to express opsins rendering them 
sensitive to light(Simon et al., 2020). Indeed, once light capture has 
been lost, it is interesting to observe that the inner retinal neural cir-
cuitry from bipolar cells to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) often remain 
intact. This gives rise to further opportunities to salvage vision in 
advanced disease via the use of gene therapy. These approaches briefly 
described here are the major avenues of gene therapy for inherited 
retinal dystrophies that are being perused today. They all benefit from 
the emergence of efficient and safe viral vectors (in particular, the 
adeno-associated virus) capable of transducing different retinal cell 
types that constitute targets for gene therapy. 
1.4. What other strategies and how do they compare to gene therapy? 
Implantation of an electronic retinal prosthesis or other devices that 
aid in visual performance have been pursued over the last two decades 
(Scholl et al., 2016). Retinal prostheses are designed to restore a basic 
sense of sight to people with profound vision loss. They require a rela-
tively intact posterior visual pathway (optic nerve, lateral geniculate 
nucleus and visual cortex). Despite reorganization and cell loss, the 
inner retinal neurons retain the capacity for signal transmission. 
Morphometric analyses have shown that, based on the nuclei count, 
around half or the retinal ganglion cells survive in patients with virtually 
no photoreceptors. Retinal implants are options for those patients 
including both retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degenera -
tion patients. Electrode-based extracellular stimulation operates by 
injecting current into the tissue of interest via a single or an array of 
electrode placed nearby (Yue et al., 2016). In bioelectronic retinal im-
plants, an electrode array is placed in close proximity to the retina, 
forming an electrochemical interface with the physiological liquid sur-
rounding the retina. Stimulating electrodes inject electrical current 
which passes through the cell membranes of the retinal neurons and is 
recorded through the return electrode. Firing of action potentials is 
initiated when membrane depolarization exceeds a threshold. The sys-
tem is completed by a visual interface, a pocket processor and a retina 
stimulator. There have now been three regulatory-approved retinal 
prostheses. Over five hundred patients have been implanted globally 
over the past 15 years. Devices generally provide an improved ability to 
localize high-contrast objects, navigate, and perform basic orientation 
tasks. The visual acuity that can be attained with implants is low. Unlike 
the optical stimulation, where the incident beam can be as narrow as the 
width of a photoreceptor, electrode-based activation is limited by the 
physical size of the electrodes as well as the lateral current spread. 
Moreover the information processing performed by retinal neurons is 
lost, since bipolar and/or ganglion cells are being activated simulta -
neously. Stimulation at different retinal locations may result in differ -
ential levels of visual acuity as the receptive field converges as a function 
of eccentricity e the receptive field varies from 1:1 photoreceptors: 
ganglion cells at the fovea to thousands:1 at the peripheral retina. Thus, C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
3the acuity is dependent not only on the spacing of the pixels, but also on 
the pixel size and the contact with the target neurons and cannot be 
matched with the physical limits imposed on electrical implants. 
Furthermore, adverse events such as conjunctival erosion, retinal 
detachment, loss of light perception, and the need for revision surgery, 
have been reported for patients having received such prosthetic devices. 
Device related risks, such as overstimulation or delamination of 
implanted components, can also cause other rare but real risks. Current 
challenges include how to improve visual acuity, enlarge the 
field-of-view, and reduce a complex visual scene to its most salient 
components through image processing. 
In addition to prosthetic approaches, direct replacement of lost 
retinal cells by transplantation of human embryonic or induced plurip -
otent stem cell-derived RPE or photoreceptors is also a compelling 
strategy. Although regenerative medicine is several decades younger 
than gene therapy current developments offer hopes of replacing 
photoreceptor cells lost to inherited retinal degenerations (Gagliardi, 
Ben M’Barek and Goureau, 2019 ). Major strides have been made thanks 
to the discovery of Yamanaka factors allowing reprogramming of any 
they of cells into a state of induced pluripotency. This has opened the 
way to generation of retinal cells and retinal tissue from human 
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). These cells can then be grown in culture 
and differentiated towards the desired specialized cell types. Retinal 
pigment epithelium cells derived from PSCs is already in clinical testing. Transplantation of retinal photoreceptors has been more complex but 
the most recent advances in 3D culture systems has allowed generation 
of human retinal organoids increasing availability of human photore -
ceptor cells for future clinical applications in IRDs. The generation and 
characterization of transplantable photoreceptors from PSCs and other 
current obstacles regarding PSC-based preclinical studies for photore -
ceptor replacement are now conducted in animal models. Nevertheless, 
most recent turning point in our understanding of donor photoreceptor 
integration revealed many artefactual findings in the early photore -
ceptor transplantation period and highlighted crucial obstacles that 
hinder the photoreceptor replacement. These obstacles also include the 
growth and maintenance of a functional outer segment generating light 
responses, crucial for treatment efficacy using such approach. The most 
promising strategies to overcome these obstacles in the future, and 
perspectives on the approaching advancement in the application of PSC 
technology for treatment of photoreceptor degenerative diseases is dis-
cussed in more detail in a recent review (Gagliardi, Ben M’Barek and 
Goureau, 2019 ). 
2.Historical perspective: genes and mutations 
Hundreds of genes have been implicated in IRDs, thus making gene 
or mutation specific gene therapy approaches a colossal task (Fig. 1). As 
it is noted in Table 1, the clinical trials for IRDs have thus far targeted

4genes involved in autosomal recessive disorders (i.e. those that create 
null genotypes) were supplementing the gene to produce a functional 
protein can be a straightforward approach(Stone, 2009). Some recessive 
diseases could not benefit from AAV mediated gene replacement due to 
other challenges that limit the development of therapies using the AAV 
platform such as the size limit of the therapeutic cassette(Trapani et al., 
2014). This created new ways of thinking about the use of AAV for gene 
therapy that is not limited to direct replacement or correction of a 
disease-causing gene. With our increasing understanding of disease 
mechanisms, it became clear that AAV can also be used to augment 
processes and pathways downstream of the mutation, which can prove 
beneficial for more retinal diseases beyond IRDs (including complex 
diseases like glaucoma, age related macular degeneration)(Campo -
chiaro, 2011). Several gene therapy mechanisms targeting metabolic 
deficits that occur during rod-cone dystrophy have been developed as 
alternative ‘gene independent’ therapies (Fig. 1). Such gene therapies 
that target a larger population of patients by inducing the expression of 
neuroprotective factors/anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory proteins are 
quickly moving into the therapeutic landscape. The discovery of opto-
genetics which endows light responsiveness to any given neuron by the 
expression of opsins has also appeared as an attractive experimental 
strategy to compensate for photoreceptor cell loss that is a common 
phenotype of the great majority of IRDs. 
2020 (15 years later)- we know a lot more about the mutations and 
the discovery of gene editing has opened new perspectives to correct 
dominant mutations and mutations found on large genes (Fig. 1). This 
extremely promising technology extends the promise of gene replace -
ment and will allow the correction of gene defects in situ, allowing 
corrected genes to be expressed within their genomic context and be 
regulated by the cell’s endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms(Yanik 
et al., 2017). 
Genome editing represents a new solution to treat IRD, if side effects 
of Cas9 can be controlled and limited in vivo. It could be particularly 
useful for dominant mutations where gene replacement is not sufficient, 
or for large genes that do not fit into AAV and are therefore not good 
candidates for a simple gene replacement. Last year, a phase I/II clinical 
trial for a CRISPR-based therapy administered directly inside the human 
body. This trial is targeting mutations in the CEP290 gene causing Leber 
Congenital Amaurosis 10 by delivering AAV encoded CRISPR/Cas9 via a 
subretinal injection. The initial step is to inject small amounts of the 
CRISPR/Cas9 in adult patients who are nearly blind to test for safety. If 
everything goes well, other patients will receive higher doses. 
The gene-editing revolution continues to rapidly evolve from a sys-
tem that can create targeted cuts to strategies allowing cut and replace, 
with the discovery, for example, of HITI(Suzuki et al., 2016). More 
recently, David Liu’s team has generated new gene-editing tools named 
base editors (Gaudelli et al., 2017; Komor et al., 2017) and prime editors 
(Anzalone et al., 2019) that can correct single nucleotides without 
introducing breaks in the DNA. Less than 10 years after its discovery, 
CRISPR, base and prime editing the ultimate promise for the treatment 
of inherited retinal diseases. The refinements and improvements of these 
technologies themselves(Rees and Liu, 2018) and annex technologies for 
their delivery(Luther et al., 2018) into human cells will be the focus of 
research and development efforts over the next decade. It is important to 
note that this versatile platform technology has unlimited potential as it 
can also be used to activate or suppress the expression of endogenous 
genes to promote survival (as in the trophic factor approach)(Moreno 
et al., 2018) or even regenerate dying photoreceptors by reprogramming 
of Müller glial cells(Yao et al., 2018) creating the next generation of 
gene therapies for IRDs. 
3.Phenotypes and phenotyping 
As previously mentioned IRDs are a heterogeneous group of diseases 
with diverse mechanisms of inheritance, and with a variable onset and 
progression. An autosomal recessive inheritance mode is observed in Table 1

5over half of all RP cases, and in most cases of Leber congenital amaurosis 
(LCA). LCA represents a group of hereditary retinal diseases character -
ized and unified by the following clinical features: severe and early vi-
sual loss, sensory nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and absent electrical 
signals on ERG( den Hollander et al., 2008 ). LCA presents very early in 
life, usually at around the age of 6 weeks, when parents note the oscil-
lations of the eyes (nystagmus) or the absence of fixation( Galvin et al., 
2005 ). Most vision researchers currently consider LCA the most severe 
retinal dystrophy without major systemic features. The most common 
form of macular dystrophy, Stargardt disease, is inherited in the auto-
somal recessive form. Clinical gene therapy studies are ongoing for 
Stargardt disease as well as, cone-rod dystrophies CNGA3, CNGB3. 
The most common IRD is Retinitis Pigmentosa also referred to as 
Rod-Cone dystrophy (RCD). Despite different mutations, RCDs share a 
similar phenotype and mechanisms, characterized by photoreceptor 
degeneration which ultimately leads to complete blindness. The pro-
gression of the degeneration can be divided in three separate stages:  
1) rod photoreceptors start to degenerate from the periphery towards 
the center of the retina as a consequence of the mutation (Lin et al., 
2009 ). The degeneration of rods involves apoptosis( Cottet and 
Schorderet, 2009 ), however, the mechanism leading to cell death has 
still not been entirely elucidated for every mutation. Previous studies 
suggest that the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein could 
be toxic for the rod photoreceptors( Lin and LaVail, 2010 ). Other 
studies suggest microglia and oxidative stress may also contribute 
(Zeng et al., 2014 ; Di Pierdomenico et al., 2019 ) and mutations in the 
interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein have also been reported 
to activate apoptotic and necrotic pathways (Sato et al., 2013 ). 
Regardless of the mutation, rod degeneration results in night blind -
ness, that is, the loss of ability to see in the dark or low-lit environ -
ments. Night blindness is usually the first symptom of RCD and 
addressing the disease at this point is challenging, requiring knowl -
edge of the mutation and means to repair it or replace it before major 
loss of rods.  
2) In the second stage of the degeneration, the loss of rods causes the 
degeneration of cone outer segments from the periphery towards the 
center of the retina. Rods are responsible for the production or rod- 
derived cone viability factor (RdCVF), a trophic factor that is 
fundamental for cone survival (L˘eveillard et al., 2004 ). The result of 
cone outer segment loss is a progressive shrinking of the visual field, 
resulting in “tunnel vision ”. A therapeutic strategy at this stage could 
consider the supply of RdCVF or other trophic factors, in order to 
prolong the survival of the cones and preserve their function. Ther-
apeutic strategies can also combat oxidative stress caused by rod loss 
or help fight inflammation.  
3) In the third, stage of RCD, surviving cone cells lose their light 
responsive outer segment. Indeed the maintenance of the outer 
segment is metabolically demanding and difficult to maintain in 
absence of trophic support from rods. At this stage, remaining cones 
(mostly in the fovea) become sparser and lose their outer segment 
leading to loss of the remaining tunnel vision.  
4) In the fourth and final, stage of degeneration, cone cell bodies might 
completely degenerate, leaving the retina with only inner retinal 
neurons( Stone, 1992 ). 
After photoreceptor loss, the inner retina undergoes substantial 
remodeling and rewiring, abandoning its classical structure in favor of a 
more disorganized pattern( Marc and Jones, 2003 ). This last stage of 
degeneration is felt as complete blindness in patients. 
Despite the remodeling, however, the majority of inner retinal neu-
rons, together with retinal ganglion cells, remain viable even at late 
stages of degeneration (Humayun et al., 1999 ). The presence of such 
cells is fundamental for restorative therapies like optogenetics. 
In conclusion, outer retinal degeneration is a common phenotype 
across IRDs, but its onset and its progression depend on a series of factors including the gene that is involved, the inheritance of the mutation, and 
the personal history of the patient (in other words, each patient is 
unique). Pairing the patient population with the appropriate gene-based 
therapies is crucial for successful outcomes in the clinic. The choice of 
therapy will depend on the disease gene, the disease stage, with a 
particular emphasis on the state of the photoreceptor cells and their 
anticipated survival based on the natural history of the disease. The 
latter two parameters are determined by retinal phenotyping which is 
performed by imaging studies and functional tests as discussed below. 
The retina being mostly transparent its observation became possible 
with the discovery of fundus autofluorescence imaging and more 
recently optical coherence tomography (OCT) and adaptive optics (AO)- 
enhanced ophthalmoscopy (AOO) in the 1990s. Today, OCT has become 
part of the standard of care in ophthalmic hospitals, while AOO is 
currently reserved for clinical research. Using OCT retinal layers and 
their corresponding cell types can be identified in patients with good 
fixation. AOO gives further detail into subpopulations or retinal neurons 
in the living human eye(Rossi et al., 2011 ). These technologies are 
helping to establish genotype-phenotype correlations in patient pop-
ulations across the globe. 
An adequate quantification of vision is equally crucial, as are the 
objective evaluations of the therapeutic benefit for patients must be 
known to advance. Other visual assessments performed in the clinical 
setting include electrophysiology (electroretinograms), visual evoked 
potentials (VEP) and psychophysical tests, which are objective measures 
of vision( McGregor et al., 2019 ). The visual electrophysiology tests are 
compiled using International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology and 
Vision (ISCEV) standards. The tests assess visual functions along the 
visual pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Other 
methodologies, look at visual performance as an indirect measure. 
Functional vision is often described as the ability to independently 
conduct visual tasks pertaining to daily life. The assessment of vision in 
blind individuals, low vision and ultra-low vision patients is a major 
challenge and is essential to set the baseline on which we will construct 
gene therapies aiming to restore function. In addition to evaluating the 
standard outcomes reflecting visual function such as visual acuity 
contrast sensitivity and visual field, which is difficult in these patients, 
so called performance-based tests can provide additional functional 
measures looking at visual improvement for tasks of daily life such as 
orientation, mobility, reading. Such techniques are currently being 
developed as the early clinical trials for visual restoration made it clear 
that robust assessments tools for measuring functional vision were 
needed as patients receiving the early versions of emerging vision res-
tauration therapies such as implants would improve to the level of legal 
blindness. Direction, localization and motion-based tests on a computer 
monitor, as well as real-world assessments situation simulations, stan-
dardized multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT) formed the basis of 
these tests and were complemented by Patient-Reported-Outcomes and 
of Functional Vision assessment( da Cruz et al., 2016 ; Lombardi et al., 
2018 ). These new approaches to measure functional vision were also 
implemented in the clinical trials leading to approval Luxturna for Leber 
Congenital Amaurosis. Low vision rehabilitation centers dedicated to 
evaluation and training are also being used in several centers including 
ours (StreetLab, Homelab) and Kobe Eye Center in Japan. These centers, 
in addition to investigating behavioral and adaptive mechanisms in 
response to therapy aim to create a supportive environment for visually 
impaired patients. 
4.Delivering each therapy 
The basic principles of pharmacology also apply to gene therapy: the 
gene is considered a pro-drug that needs to reach its target tissue at 
sufficient doses and exert its activity specifically. The particular condi -
tions governing the safety and feasibility are dictated by the choice of 
delivery vectors and injection routes. Below we detail the vector systems 
that have been used so far in pre-clinical and clinical gene therapy C. Botto et al.

6studies. These vectors broadly fall under two main categories: viral 
vectors and synthetic vectors each with specific constraints and 
advantages. 
As we discuss in detail below for each vector system, an important 
feature is a vector ’s ability to enter into the target cells in complex tis-
sues representing many physical and biological barriers to transduction. 
Our ability to obtain sufficient level transgene expression in a given 
retinal cell population depends on our ability to solve a complex, 
species-specific equation involving at least 8 parameters: Injection 
route, vector choice, dose, promoter, cis-regulatory elements of the 
transgene cassette, state of the tissue, nature of transgene, immune 
status of the subject all come into play to determine whether or not we 
obtain transgene expression. Below we discuss these parameters and our 
current understanding of vector mediated gene delivery to the retina. 
4.1. Injection routes 
The three primary methods of delivery of ocular medications to the 
eye are topical, local ocular (ie, subconjunctival, intravitreal, retro-
bulbar, intracameral), and systemic. The most appropriate method of 
administration depends on the area of the eye to be medicated. For 
retinal gene therapy in view of clinical application three local routes of 
delivery are preferred: intravitreal or subretinal. Both subretinal dosing 
and intravitreal administration of gene therapy vectors in higher species 
induce mild and transient dose-dependent inflammatory responses. 
These responses seem to be greater in the vitreal compartment compared 
to subretinal space which offers better shielding of the vector from the 
immune system. Indeed, foreign protein and foreign DNA are known 
inducers of inflammation, which is also true in the immune-privileged 
ocular environment( Khabou, Cordeau, et al., 2018 ; Xiong et al., 
2019 ). A suprachoroidal approach has also been suggested more 
recently( Chung et al., 2021 ). 
4.2. Vectors 
4.2.1. Viral vectors 
Viral vectors have the unique capacity to bring genetic material into 
the nuclei of non-dividing cells rendering them attractive for gene 
therapy in the retina. Today most studies of gene delivery and gene 
therapy in the retina use three types of viral vectors: adenovirus (Ad), 
lentivirus (Lv) and AAV. The size and biochemical properties of the 
capsid determine its distribution in the retinal tissue, its tropism towards 
various cell populations and immunological profile determining the 
longevity of gene expression in transduced cells. Below, we review these 
three vectors in view of these properties (capsid structure, size, spread 
and longevity of transgene expression) and their application today in 
retinal gene therapy (Fig. 2). 
4.2.1.1. Adenoviruses. Adenoviruses (Ad) contain a linear, double- 
stranded DNA genome with up to 37 kB carrying capacity contained 
in an icosahedral non-enveloped capsid with fiber-like projections with 
over 50 different human Ad serotypes generating a rapid onset of 
expression at 48 h post-injection. Vector genomes stay episomal and 
highly quality vector preps can be routinely manufactured but Ad’s large 
carrying capacity and immunogenic nature have reduced their appli -
cation in retinal gene therapy. A recent comprehensive study comparing 
the retinal transduction profiles of different naturally-occurring or 
mutant Ad serotypes shows that none of the Ad variants significantly 
outperforms Ad5 in adult murine PR transduction (Puppo et al., 2014 ). 
To date, no clinical trials based on Ad were undertaken for gene 
replacement, although two clinical trials have been performed using 
Ad5 intraocularly in order to treat age-related macular degeneration (Q. 
D. and N, 2006 ) and retinoblastoma (Ch˘evez-Barrios et al., 2005 ). To 
sum up, adenoviruses can be a vector of interest for a gene therapy using 
a big transgene but they remain a second choice because of uncertainties about the expression level and longevity of the transgene particularly in 
larger animal models. 
4.2.1.2. Lentiviruses. Lentiviruses (LV) are enveloped retroviruses con-
taining a single-stranded RNA genome with 8 kB carrying capacity. They 
infect both dividing and non-dividing cells with chromosomal integra -
tion at random sites. Although chromosomal integration is not an 
advantage in the retina, their relatively large capacity has allowed their 
use in multicistronic expression systems allowing delivery of multiple 
therapeutic proteins to the retina (Williams et al., 2006 ; Verrier et al., 
2011 ; Semple-Rowland and Berry, 2014 ) or for delivery of large trans -
genes to the RPE. 
Although their diffusion across the inner and outer limiting mem-
branes of the neural retina into the tight extracellular matrix is limited 
by particle size and composition one study suggests that certain types of 
Lv can allow gene delivery to the photoreceptors in some model animals. 
The capacity of lentiviruses to infect the human retinal explants ex vivo 
has been shown in more than one study( Busskamp et al., 2010 ; Sengupta 
et al., 2016 ). Thus, like Ad, Lv can be a vector of choice in case a large 
carrying capacity is needed, but to achieve infection of more retinal cell 
types, validating level of expression in primates by quantitative methods 
revealing distribution across different cell types is still needed. Never -
theless, their infectious capacity (on a per particle base) seems greater 
than AAV vectors, particularly in human retinal explants. The devel -
opment of the non-primate equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) has 
raised hopes for overcoming this limitation forming the basis for the 
ongoing clinical trials for Stargardt disease (STGD) and USH type IB 
(USH1B) using this vector( Kachi et al., 2009 ). 
4.2.1.3. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV). Today, AAV is without a 
question the vector of choice for retinal gene delivery with the majority 
of clinical trials using this vector for gene delivery. We will thus present 
this vector and its retinal transduction properties more extensively in 
this section. AAV belongs to the family of Parvoviridae. It is a depend -
ovirus, requiring the presence of a helper virus for replication (Hastie 
and Samulski, 2015 ) with a particle size of 25 nm. AAV is a 
non-enveloped virus, carrying single stranded DNA of 4.7 kB. 
Over the past 50 years, significant strides have been made in making 
an ideal vector out of AAV. Recombinant AAV used for therapeutic ap-
plications no longer contains rep or cap genes which makes the repli-
cation of viral genome extremely unlikely in the infected host cells. AAV 
has very low immunogenicity compared to other disease-causing viruses 
like Lv and Ad. Although immunogenicity of AAV is not a straightfor -
ward concept, because it depends on many factors such as transgene 
transported by AAV, promoter in front of expressed transgene, serotype 
of AAV, the dose of AAV or injection route, it has been used successfully 
for long term gene expression in several animal models and has shown 
efficacy results for a decade in the clinic( Hastie and Samulski, 2015 ). 
The capsid of AAV is the most important parameter that determines 
which retinal cells will be transduced once the vector solution is deliv-
ered in proximity of the retina. It also plays a role in the immunogenicity 
of the vector. Depending on the administration route a capsid can reach 
multiple cell types, usually with a tendency to lead to most expression in 
cells it first comes into contact with. The specifics of which sub- 
populations of neurons are targeted also depends on the interaction of 
the AAV capsid with its primary and secondary cell surface receptors 
mediating its entry into the cells and trafficking into the nucleus. There 
are twelve characterized serotypes of AAV (Schmidt et al., 2008 ), each 
with unique capsid associated properties. AAV2 was the first serotype to 
be used for gene transfer applications and has been utilized in the ma-
jority of AAV clinical trials to date. With the discovery of over 100 novel 
AAV sequences by biomining (Gao et al., 2005 ; Schmidt et al., 2006 ) this 
number of serotypes expanded and pseudotyped recombinant AAV 
vectors packaging a transgene cassette flanked by AAV2 ITRs into the 
capsid of other serotypes are now broadly used. C. Botto et al.

7AAV capsid is formed of beta barrels and loops with beta barrels 
forming the inner surface of capsid and surface exposed loops. These 
loops contain secondary structures as beta ribbons (Fig. 3) with zones 
forming peaks referred to as threefold proximal peaks. The farthest point 
of these peaks from the center forms the most exterior part of the capsid 
initiating contact with the environment and determining its tropism. 
Neighboring loops interact with one another (Xie et al., 2002 ) forming 9 
hypervariable regions (Bennett et al., 2020 ) each influencing a different 
feature of the capsid (see Fig. 3 and Table 2 for a summary). Despite 
increasing grasp of the capsid structure, engineering the capsid ratio-
nally to meet the demands of specific gene delivery scenarios remains 
complex. For example, replacement of amino acids in some positions 
modify heparan sulfate binding but others abolish it completely( Boye 
Sanford L., Bennett Antonette, VanVliet Kim, Dinculescu Astra, White 
Miranda, Peterson James, Agbandje-McKenna Mavis, 2014 ). Moreover, 
we still don’t know how to use this information on heparin binding to 
create a variant having just enough heparin binding to get through the 
inner limiting membrane of the retina. This is why directed evolution has gained interest to generate AAV variants with desirable features 
(Fig. 4). Directed evolution is a mimic of the natural evolution process in 
a laboratory setting. It requires creation of artificial variants of AAV, 
that can be selected for a desired trait( Kotterman and Schaffer, 2014 ). In 
AAV directed evolution, the capsid gene is evolved by iterative rounds of 
mutagenesis, and selection (Fig. 4). 
Retinal tropism and transduction efficiency of different AAV sero-
types vary greatly depending on route of ocular delivery and species 
(Jüttner et al., 2019 ). With subretinal delivery, all AAV serotypes suc-
cessfully transduce the RPE and great majority also transduce the ONL 
(Fig. 2). Suprachoroidal injections are recently being implemented and 
according to recent studies in model animals they seem to mirror 
transduction profile of subretinal delivery for all AAV serotypes with a 
wider distribution and greater average ONL transduction efficiency 
(Chung et al., 2021 ). Intravitreal delivery on the other hand results in 
transduction primarily of the inner retina with naturally occurring se-
rotypes( Kalesnykas et al., 2017 ). This transduction profile is improved 
with viral vectors designed by directed evolution which have acquired

Cellular tropism of various viral and non-viral vectors by intravitreal (left) and subretinal (right) administration into the retina. C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
8the capacity to lead to pan-retinal gene delivery into all retinal cell types 
in rodents( Dalkara et al., 2013 ). Pan retinal gene delivery to the retina 
after intravitreal injections remain a problem in primate species with a 
thick inner limiting membrane( Byrne et al., 2020 ). 
In addition to understanding serotype-specific differences, the 
development of AAV-mediated gene therapy in humans requires 
knowledge of species-specific differences in retinal tropism and trans -
duction important to translation of preclinical data in animal models to 
human clinical trials( Jüttner et al., 2019 ). The results of a growing 
number of studies highlight important differences in tropism in rodents, 
pigs, dogs and primates when compared to tests on human retinal ex-
plants. Because of similarities to the human eye size pigs and non-human 
primates are often used as preclinical models. Although the eye size is 
closer to the human eye in these large animal models; species-specific differences between AAV transduction profiles after both subretinal 
and intravitreal injections have been reported( Barker et al., 2009 ; Yin 
et al., 2011 ; Khabou, Garita-Hernandez et al., 2018 ; Jüttner et al., 2019 ; 
Byrne et al., 2020 ). 
Relative to subretinal or suprachoroidal delivery, intravitreal in-
jections are routine clinic-based procedures commonly used for drug 
delivery to treat a variety of retinal diseases, including diabetic reti-
nopathy, retinal vein occlusions, non-infectious uveitis, and age-related 
macular degeneration. Thus far, however, there have been fewer num-
ber of clinical trials evaluating intravitreal delivery of AAV for the 
treatment of inherited retinal disease( Bennett, 2017 ). Numerous chal-
lenges to effective retinal transduction via intravitreal delivery of AAV 
exist, including the large volume of vitreous in the human eye, the 
presence of a thick ILM and other factors such as antibody neutralization 
(Kotterman et al., 2014 ). Importantly, substantial variability in retinal 
transduction observed when testing AAV serotypes in human explant 
models should be interpreted with caution as an explant does not have 
RPE attached, vector stocks deposited on the photoreceptor side or RGC 
side do not confront the same intact barriers as in vivo( Hickey et al., 
2017 ). The strategic selection of AAV serotype and ocular delivery route 
for human trials should also consider these factors which cannot be 
recapitulated as a whole in any given model in vivo or in vitro. 
4.2.2. Synthetic vectors 
Synthetic vectors are also often referred as nanoparticles (NPs) 
because of their sizes are in the nanometric range. These vectors are 
positively charged polymers, polysaccharides or lipids that interact with 
nucleic acids to compact them into particles that can be internalized into 
cells. Synthetic vectors are easier to produce compared to biological 
agents reducing production costs compared to viruses( Trapani et al., 
2014 ). Their derivation by changes in molecular structure can be easily 
implemented and they can carry up to 20 kb of DNA (Fink et al., 2006 ), 
which makes them suitable for delivery of genes like ABCA4 or USH2A 
too large to be accommodated in AAV particles. Like AAVs and Ad, they 
do not provide integration into the genome, alleviating insertional 
mutagenesis. However, their cellular uptake and ability to transfer the 
DNA through the nuclear pores, is determined by their size and charge. 
Most studies of gene delivery to the retina using synthetic vectors to date 
used subretinal injections and only a few vectors seem to transduce 
efficiently the neural retina or the RPE without toxicity( Adijanto and 
Naash, 2015 ). One of them is CK30PEG - a 30-mer cationic polylysine 
conjugated with 10-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG), which produces 
rod-shaped compacted DNA NPs (Farjo et al., 2006 ; Fink et al., 2006 ). 
These have been reported to deliver DNA to the RPE and photoreceptor 
cells (Han, Conley, R. Makkia et al., 2012 ). Remarkably, their efficacy 
has been shown to last for up to 1 year in rodents albeit with lower gene 
expression levels than those obtained with AAVs. CK30PEG NPs are 
thought to be internalized by nucleolin, which transfers the compacted

10DNA directly into the nucleus. The small minor diameter (8–11 nm) of 
these particles seem largely responsible for their ability to get into the 
nuclei of retinal cells. As such, they were reported to lead to functional 
improvements in mouse models carrying mutations in 
photoreceptor-specific genes like the Abca4 / model of Stargardt 
disease( Han, Conley, R. S. Makkia et al., 2012 ). Chitosan (a poly-
saccharide) NPs were shown to transduce photoreceptors and RPE after 
a subretinal injection and some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after 
intravitreal injection( Puras et al., 2013 ; Mitra et al., 2014 ). Solid lipid 
nanoparticles (SLNs) are considered to be among the most effective 
lipid-based vectors. They consist of a solid lipid matrix surrounded by a 
layer of surfactants in an aqueous dispersion( Battaglia et al., 2016 ). 
Hyaluronic acid modified SLN transporting plasmids expressing GFP and 
RS1 were shown to transduce the RPE, the photoreceptors, and some 
RGCs and when carrying the human RS1 gene were able to improve the 
phenotype of a mouse model of XLRS (Apaolaza et al., 2016 ). Never -
theless, the efficiency of these NPs seems lower than those obtained with 
viral vectors, particularly AAV. Another limitation of NPs is their 
formulation which can be difficult as some compounds are highly 
viscous preventing their wide distribution into the retina. 
Current nanoparticle-based gene delivery in the eye has focused on 
using DNA as the therapeutic of choice. However, DNA delivery using 
nanoparticles is inherently inefficient due to the nuclear entry require -
ment in post-mitotic retinal cells. There is an emerging need to develop 
non-viral vectors which can generate therapeutic levels of protein pro-
duction especially for applications where transient presence of the 
protein is desirable. The emergence of in vitro transcribed mRNA has 
expanded our ability to achieve high gene expression from mRNA by 
preventing immune response activation and stabilizing the mRNA thus 
expanding its half-life( Kowalski et al., 2019 ). mRNA mediated expres -
sion is thus an attractive strategy for delivery of endo/exonucleases for 
gene editing or activation of transcription factors for regenerative ap-
plications. In vivo, mRNA delivery to mouse photoreceptors has been 
described after the subretinal injection (Devoldere et al., 2019 ). A sec-
ond study uses an ionizable lipid to deliver mRNA in the retina and 
shows high protein expression in the RPE(Patel et al., 2019 ; Ryals et al., 
2020 ). 
Although, the discovery of smaller Cas orthologues derived from 
Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9)( Ran et al., 2015 ) Campylobacter jejuni 
(CjCas9) (Y. B. Kim et al., 2017b ) allow its delivery with AAVs, the 
persistence of the Cas9 protein obtained via AAV mediated constitutive 
expression raises the possibility of permanent recombination in the 
genome, endogenous genetic disruption through long-term exposure to 
the encoded Cas9 protein, and potential immune responses( Charles -
worth et al., 2019 ). DIrect transfer of Cas9 mRNA or protein with its 
gRNA (RNP) can offer a transient presence of Cas9 which is degraded 
within three days(K. Kim et al., 2017a ). Indeed, it has already been 
shown that intracellular delivery of a Cas9 protein/gRNA complex using 
cationic lipids can target gene modification with high efficiency and 
greater specificity than administration of Cas9 DNA (Zuris et al., 2015 ; 
Gao et al., 2018 ). This approach has been shown to be effective in mouse 
inner ear cells (Zuris et al., 2015 ), in the retinal pigment epithelium of 
the retina (Y. B. Kim et al., 2017b ) and recently in a mouse model of 
genetic deafness leading to phenotypic improvement (Gao et al., 2018 ). 
Kim et al., are the first to send Cas9 protein in vivo by a subretinal in-
jection. They show a 22% indels of VEGFA in RPE cells leading to a 
therapeutic effect 7 days after the injection with an increased CNV area 
(Y. B. Kim et al., 2017b ). There have not been any studies showing 
applicability in the neural retina thus far. 
In addition to delivery of nucleases, mRNA ’s ability to deliver large 
transgenes could be a modular alternative for base editors or prime 
editing tools that do not fit into a single AAV. 
Even if mRNA or protein do not face the same nuclear barrier as DNA 
delivery, many extracellular and intracellular barriers prevent efficient 
outcomes. The main challenges of the stability and immunogenicity of 
the mRNA are being sorted out by the in vitro transcription methods but for protein delivery, the challenge is even bigger as proteins are more 
variable in charge, size and shape than DNA or RNA. Therefore, different 
vectors are likely required for each editing system. Some commercial 
lipids have already been utilized (i.e. 
Lipofectamine ™ CRISPRMAX ™ Cas9, ThermoFisher) but are for 
now only for in vitro use. 
The transport efficacy of synthetic vectors is still weak compared to 
AAV in vivo and more work is needed to improve the Cas9 mRNA or 
protein and sgRNA co-delivery to the retina for therapeutic benefit. 
These future improvements in mRNA and protein delivery systems also 
need to consider potential toxicity issues. 
5.Moving towards therapies 
The primordial question in moving towards successful implementa -
tion of therapies is matching the patient genotype/phenotype at the time 
of intervention with an adequate therapeutic approach. For simplifica -
tion, we will focus on the predominant phenotype encountered in rod- 
cone dystrophy patients. As mentioned above, in retinitis pigmentosa, 
mutations mostly in rod transcripts lead to degeneration of these cells 
(stage I) followed by progressive cone degeneration that spans two 
distinct stages (stages II and III). In stage II, cones still have an outer and 
inner segment, whereas these features are lost in the subsequent stage 
III, leading to so-called “dormant cones ”. In the final stage (stage IV), all 
photoreceptor cells are lost altogether. Below we discuss different 
therapies in view of their utility in each stage and in some stationary 
diseases that fall outside these phenotypic manifestations. 
5.1. Stage 1 therapies 
5.1.1. Gene replacement for monogenic recessive diseases 
After an intense period of gene identification in the 80s and 90s, it 
became evident that some of the monogenic recessive diseases could 
benefit from the so-called gene replacement approach (also called gene 
addition or gene supplementation) where a cDNA copy of the mutant 
gene is delivered to the affected cell type to compensate the lack of 
protein production (Fig. 5). With the advances in vector technology (see 
below) encouraging results started to be obtained in model animals in 
several retinal dystrophies. Among those, type 2 LCA seemed to be an 
excellent candidate as the causal gene RPE65 had been identified and 
was associated with a slowly progressing phenotype where the retina 
stayed in stages II and III(Schimmer and Breazzano, 2015 ). Photore -
ceptors persisted over decades leading to a rather large window of op-
portunity for therapeutic intervention. Mutations in the gene encoding 
the RPE- specific protein RPE65 account for about 5–10% of LCA cases 
(Thompson et al., 2000 ; Apte, 2018 ) Encouraging results from both 
small and large animal showed that AAV-mediated RPE65 expression 
slowed down or reverse vision loss, and paved the way toward first 
application in humans( Bennett, 2017 ). Adult patients of various ages 
received a single subretinal injection of AAV vector carrying the RPE65 
gene in their worst-seeing eye leading showing both the safety and ef-
ficacy of this approach( Bainbridge and Ali, 2008 ). The improvements in 
scores of best-corrected visual acuity, kinetic visual field, nystagmus, 
pupillary light reflex, microperimetry, dark-adapted perimetry, 
dark-adapted full-field sensitivity in treated eyes compared to untreated 
eyes confirmed the benefits and paved the way for administration of 
AAV-RPE65 to contralateral eyes of some patients where recovery of 
retinal function was also observed in the second eye. In these early trials 
there were some effects related to surgery such as lack of improvement 
in foveal function despite vector having been delivered to the fovea in 
some of the patients. This could be attributed to surgery which disrupts 
the intricate connection between RPE and foveal cones which is different 
than those between RPE and peripheral cones( Fisher et al., 2005 ). Along 
these lines, subretinal injection into a limited region under the retina 
was responsible for formation of pseudo-foveas in patients pointing to-
wards the need to expand the treated zone for better outcomes. Such C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
11improvements might be in the horizon with the development of better 
AAV vectors (see below). 
In addition to this limitation in spread of the treatment, two groups 
also reported that early visual improvements in RPE65-treated patients 
with LCA were limited in time in some patients. In a group of patients, 
visual benefits persisted up to 3 years, but two years later, the areas of 
improved vision (visual field) were found to have constricted( Bain-
bridge et al., 2015 ; Jacobson et al., 2015 ). This indicated that in adults, 
the degeneration of photoreceptors continued despite the initial 
improvement in function. Continued degeneration in treated retina can 
be due the insufficient amount of RPE65 provided by the therapy or can 
be mediated by progressive loss of trophic support (particularly for 
cones)( Aït-Ali et al., 2015 ). The possibility that the rods had progressed 
to a pre-apoptotic state by the time the intervention could also be an 
explanation to the limited duration of therapeutic benefit in these 
studies. The loss of visual function at later times after treatment is in line 
with this natural progression of degeneration. 
Despite improvements needed in our understanding of LCA2 and 
application of gene therapy towards better outcomes; gene replacement therapy was quickly implemented for other retinal degenerative diseases 
based on the promising outcomes of these pioneering studies. Gene 
replacement therapy for choroideremia, and other forms of LCA caused 
by mutations in various genes (i.e. GUCY2D), X-linked retinoschisis 
(XLRS), MERTK, achromatopsia (see Table 1 for full listing) came 
quickly as these therapies build on the successful application of AAV 
vectors in the subretinal space to encode replacement genes in the outer 
retina. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) - a maternally 
inherited disease caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations also imple -
mented use of AAVs for gene replacement via intravitreal AAV delivery 
with successful outcomes and new findings specific to this disease where 
the optic nerve implications showed unanticipated results( Dalkara et al., 
2016 ). 
Other studies used lentiviral vectors as cDNA copies of mutant genes 
were too large to be carried by AAV. Clinical trials to treat Stargardt 
disease (STGD) associated with mutations in the photoreceptor- specific 
ABCA4 gene and Myo7A associated Usher Syndrome are two examples. 
Although no serious adverse events related to the vector have been re-
ported so far efficacy in these diseases might be limited by the tropism of

Schematic representation of gene replacement using AAV and gene editing with CRISPRCas9 in a photoreceptor cell. C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
12lentiviral vectors (see below). Preliminary studies towards the devel -
opment of gene therapy for CEP290-associated LCA (LCA10) were also 
conducted. LV vector expressing full-length human CEP290 were to be 
used but due to doubts about photoreceptor transduction using LV other 
approaches were prioritized such as mutation read through with anti-
sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene edit-
ing(DiCarlo et al., 2018). Both of these technologies came into spotlight 
as a potential solution to the limited length of replacement genes that 
can be delivered with AAV vectors (see below). 
5.1.2. Silence and replace for dominant diseases 
For patients in Stage I, gene replacement is technologically the most 
straightforward option for reversing the course of recessive retinal dis-
eases caused by loss-of-function mutations. Unfortunately, this tech-
nique is not suitable for autosomal dominant (ad) diseases. Indeed, in 
this type of disease, the gene therapy approach will depend on the type 
of mutation. Autosomal dominant diseases can be caused by dominant- 
negative or gain-of-function mutations leading to proteins with antag -
onistic effect to the wild-type one in case of dominant-negative muta -
tions. In gain-of-function mutations, the encoded protein has a new 
function, also leading to toxicity. Therefore, on these types of mutations, 
a simple healthy gene supplementation is not enough: the mutated gene 
needs to be silenced to inactivate the detrimental effect (gene silencing). 
Depending on the disease and on its stage, an additional supplementa -
tion might be necessary (“silence and replace” (Farrar et al., 2012)). The 
other gene therapy options for Stage I diseases caused by 
dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations is gene correction as 
discussed further below. 
5.1.2.1. Gene silencing. Autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa 
(adRP) accounts for around 30% of all RP cases and among adRP, ~25% 
are due to mutations in the rhodopsin RHO gene. We will use rhodopsin 
mutations to illustrate therapies applicable in principal in all adRP with 
an identified mutation. No gene therapy applicable in Stage I of adRP 
has reached the clinic so far due to the more complex nature of 
substituting a healthy RHO gene while silencing the mutant copy. For 
this reason, in this section we will review pre-clinical studies on animal 
models highlighting the challenges in the way of clinical translation. 
There are more than 100 disease-causing mutations of RHO, 
dispersed across the gene, leading to adRP by different mechanisms of 
toxicity (Athanasiou et al., 2018). Gene silencing will be necessary to 
provide therapy no matter what the mutation and mechanism of mutant 
rhodopsin toxicity. The degree of silencing necessary to achieve a clin-
ical benefit will probably depend on the mutation mechanism and on the 
stage of the disease at which the intervention is made. 
Among the variety of RHO mutations, two mutations are most 
prevalent in northern America and Europe. The first one is mutation 
P23H, which is the most prevalent adRP mutation in the USA (around 
10% of the adRP in North America) (Giannelli et al., 2018). This mu-
tation has both dominant-negative and gain-of-function effects, with 
protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and with the activation 
of unfolded protein response (Lewin et al., 2014). 
To treat the disease, allele-specific disruption has been developed. 
The main target of genetic silencing strategies is the messenger RNA 
(mRNA) transcript, the function of which can be inhibited by antisense 
RNA-based, ribozyme-based and more recently by small interfering (si) 
RNA-based and micro (mi)RNA-based, approaches (Fig. 5). 
The second most prevalent RHO mutation is P347L. It is the most 
prevalent adRP mutation in Europe (Audo, Manes, Mohand-Saïd, Frie-
drich, Lancelot, Antonio, Moskova-Doumanova, Poch, Zanlonghi, 
Christian P. Hamel et al., 2010). It leads to the mistrafficking of the 
mutated protein, leading to its accumulation in the endoplasmic retic-
ulum, the plasma membrane and the synapses. The disruption of the 
synaptic transmission then creates an overload of the degradation ma-
chinery and a decreased availability of some important functional proteins (Athanasiou et al., 2018). Interestingly, silencing alone has not 
been tested for this mutation. As mutation P347L leads to a more severe 
phenotype than P23H mutation(Oh et al., 2003) silencing alone is un-
likely be sufficient for clinical benefit in patients. 
In view of the allelic heterogeneity of the RHO mutations, gene 
silencing approaches, using ribozyme or RNA interference, have been 
developed to suppress both the wild type and mutant rhodopsin. Such 
approaches have the advantage of being applicable to multiple muta -
tions. For example, Jiang and colleagues developed an shRNA that 
significantly improved photoreceptor survival, delayed disease onset, 
and ameliorated visual function in an adRP mouse model expressing 
bovine GCAP1 (Y99C) (Jiang et al., 2011). 
But RHO is an essential gene for the retinal function and its complete 
suppression will induce phenotypic degradation, as it is the case in 
recessive RP caused by RHO mutations. Therefore, mutation- 
independent suppression of both alleles will probably require supple -
mentation by the addition of exogenous rhodopsin (see silence and 
replace) in order to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. 
5.1.2.2. Gene replacement after silencing. Silencing alone might not be 
sufficient to counterbalance the pathological phenotype, in particular in 
mutation-independent approaches where the wild-type allele is also 
silenced. Along the same lines, it is anticipated that the delivery and 
expression of replacement cDNAs might not be sufficient either in this 
scenario. That being said, in an interesting past study, some benefit in 
slowing down the loss of rods had been obtained when RHO expression 
alone was achieved in a mouse model of adRP (Mao et al., 2011). 
Contrarily, in a more recent attempt of gene replacement alone in a 
mouse model RHO.P23H, no beneficial effect on retinal structure or 
function was observed (Orlans et al., 2020). Therefore, more efforts have 
been focused on coupling the silencing and the replacement. As recent 
studies also suggest, in RHO replacement it is important to monitor 
closely protein levels, depending on the model, as a too small quantity of 
protein will not be sufficient to obtain a significant rescue but an excess 
of expression might be toxic to the cell. For example, an excess of RHO 
expression level (151%) in control mice leads to outer retina toxicity 
(Orlans et al., 2020). 
As it has been developed for silencing alone, several groups used 
RNA interference techniques to silence RHO, to which they add a 
replacement of RHO cDNA. They all did subretinal injection at early 
stage (from D1 to D14). In 2007, a study used a single AAV to deliver 
siRNA and shRNA simultaneously targeting the RHO cDNA that leads to 
an increased ONL thickness (O’Reilly et al., 2007). Another study 
confirmed these results but with the use of 2 AAVs and with an addi-
tional increase of the scotopic ERG at 20-weeks post-injection (Mill-
ington-Ward et al., 2011). The persistence of the preserved ERG 
response and ONL thickness was studied up to 9 months post-injection in 
an additional study (Mao et al., 2012) as a follow up to their demon -
strated therapeutic benefits of RHO gene expression in absence of 
silencing (Mao et al., 2011). 
A possible alternative to such RNA-targeting approaches is the 
modulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level, by using zinc- 
finger (ZF)- based artificial transcription factors (ZF-ATFs) that can be 
tailored to a desired DNA target sequence(Stolzenburg et al., 2010). To 
date, several functional ZF-ATFs have been generated to modulate target 
gene expression in vitro but silencing a disease gene via vector-mediated 
somatic-gene transfer has taken more time to implement. In a newly 
designed two-step repression–replacement strategy mutations leading 
adRP has been targeted with zinc-fingers, also in combination with a 
replacement of RHO gene, showing respectively, a preserved ERG 
response at 60 days post-injection and the integrity of the photoreceptor 
outer segments (Mussolino et al., 2011; Botta et al., 2016). 
Recent translation of silence and replace strategy a large animal 
model of adRP showed that the development of clinical therapies needs 
to fine-tune the level of reduction of both mutant and WT endogenous C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
13proteins while providing sufficient resistant replacement (Cideciyan 
et al., 2018 ) with a particular focus on improving RHO supplementation. 
Silence and replace strategy is currently being developed commer -
cially into a treatment candidate gene therapy to suppress expression of 
the faulty gene and deliver the normal rhodopsin (RHO) gene, thereby 
providing a therapy that is independent of the specific causative 
rhodopsin mutation in adRP. 
The discovery and ease of application of CRISPR (see below) has also 
lent its use as a mutation-independent gene silencer instead of RNA 
interference. It has been used in vivo to silence RHO in combination with 
RHO replacement delivered by two AAVs. This treatment improved the 
ONL thickness and increased the b-wave response at D90 in P23H mice 
(Tsai et al., 2018 ). 
Another interesting approach has been tested based on non-viral 
delivery of a codon-optimized short form of RHO combined with 
shRNA for the silencing. This study showed improved ERG responses in 
the P23H mouse 60 days post-injection (Mitra et al., 2018 ). 
In summary, many studies are in progress to find a successful therapy 
for autosomal dominant RP, especially for RHO mutations. The ‘silence 
and replace ’ strategies seam today to be the most promising: neither 
silencing nor replacement alone seems to be enough to reliably rescue 
the clinical phenotype. A mutation independent silencing seems to have 
better potential clinical applicability as adRP with mutations of RHO is a 
group of rare diseases and a therapy that could be applied to all the 
different mutations would be useful to more patients. 
However today, many challenges still remain in getting hitting the 
delicate balance between sufficient silencing and replacement. The 
future might hold better possibilities in the use of CRISPR-derived base 
or prime editing that allow the correction of the mutation in situ over-
coming this obstacle (see below). This approach would allow correcting 
the mutations and thereby both silencing and replacing all at once, 
obtaining physiologically relevant control of the corrected rhodopsin 
expression under endogenous promoters. On the other hand, such 
corrective approach would necessarily be mutation specific, pausing 
additional hurdles to the already complex development issues that come 
along with adaptation of new and emerging technologies enabling gene 
editing. 
5.1.3. Gene editing 
By changing precisely and permanently the pathogenic mutation, 
gene editing overcomes many current challenges of today ’s gene ther-
apy paradigms and offers the possibility to restore physiological levels of 
expression from the corrected gene under the control of endogenous 
promoters and regulatory mechanisms. 
There are several editing mechanisms that can be applied to muta -
tions depending on the specific context surrounding them. Engineered 
nucleases can be used to target a specific sequence and lead to a double- 
stranded break (DSB) in the DNA. The cleavage generated will be 
repaired by mechanisms naturally present in mammalian cells: mainly, 
the non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ) and the homologous 
recombination repair (HDR). NHEJ introduces insertions and deletions 
(INDELS) most frequently leading to a shift in the reading frame and 
therefore an inactivation of the targeted gene. HDR takes place in the 
presence of a donor template and leads to a precise correction in actively 
dividing cells (Fig. 6). Compared to other nucleases that require engi-
neering of DNA-binding protein domains to recognize a precise 
sequence, Cas9 protein is an endonuclease that needs a unique sgRNA 
(single guide RNA) which can be easily modified to recognize a 20 bp 
sequence in the genome (Jinek et al., 2012 ). Due to this versatility and 
efficiency, CRISPR Cas9 system emerged as the tool of choice for genetic 
engineering. However, several problems remain today for its successful 
therapeutic use in the eye. First, Cas9 protein can tolerate some mis-
matches in its pairing with DNA leading to so-called off target cuts 
potentially deleterious to cellular functions unrelated to the targeted 
mutation. Different methods to predict such off target cuts in silico have 
been developed but they often do not take into account the dynamic changes in the chromatin of a specific cell type that is being targeted 
(Zischewski et al., 2017 ). For this reason off target cuts need to be 
verified experimentally – preferentially by whole genome sequencing. A 
second hurdle with the use of CRISPR for therapeutic in vivo gene 
editing is low efficiency of targeting events. Particularly, in post-mitotic 
tissues CRISPR based gene editing can be challenging. Indeed, lack of 
HDR machinery in post-mitotic cells is of special concern for therapeutic 
editing approaches in skeletal and cardiac muscles, as well as in neurons. 
Low efficacy is also correlated with delivery and the particular CRISPR 
Cas9 system used. These gene editing proteins are subject to constant 
improvements to increase their capacity to avoid off-targets, increase 
their specificity for the on-target cuts and improve overall efficiency 
(Cong et al., 2013 ; Ran et al., 2015 ; Slaymaker et al., 2016 ). 
One other concern using this system is immune responses against the 
Cas9 protein, its guide RNA and vectors that deliver this ribonucleo -
protein (RNP) into target cells. Mechanisms of innate, cellular and hu-
moral immune responses triggered need to be circumvented by various 
strategies depending on the context. Potential host immune responses 
could be directed against the Cas9 system or the new protein product 
resulting from the correction (Chew, 2018 ). Charlesworth and co-
workers are the first to highlight the existence of a pre-existing adaptive 
immune response in humans against the two most commonly used Cas9 
proteins derived from Staphylococcus pyogenes (spCas9) and Staphylo -
coccus aureus (saCas9). Their results show the pre-existence of a humoral 
response against spCas9 and saCas9 in 12 healthy adults and confirm 
previous observations indicating immunity in the human population 
(Simhadri et al., 2018 ). In addition, they reveal the presence of T lym-
phocytes at a high frequency directed against specific antigens of both 
proteins, which confirm the existence of an adaptive immune response 
against the Cas9 protein. These immune responses are expected to have 
a strong impact on the safety and efficacy of in vivo therapy employing 
these proteins. It is important to note that in addition to the immuno -
genicity of the protein Cas9 and its sgRNA, the delivery method will play 
an important role in vivo in the pathways and intensity of immune re-
sponses against gene editing therapies. 
5.1.3.1. Gene editing for autosomal dominant RP.Application of CRISPR 
Cas9 to dominant diseases has been more complex and is still in pre- 
clinical stages due to more complex issues surrounding dominant 
negative mutations. Nevertheless, gene inactivation based on Cas9/ 
sgRNA DSB was the first approach that was tested in the retina. Based on 
the formation of indels by the post mitotic predominant repair pathway 
NHEJ, this strategy requires only the delivery of Cas9 and one or two 
sgRNA. To successfully apply this strategy to dominant diseases, the 
mutant allele needs to be specifically targeted. To do so, mutation spe-
cific sgRNA or Cas9 variants with PAM sequence including the mutation 
can ensure a specific disruption of the mutant allele. This strategy was 
applied successfully in vivo in RHO.P23H mice by Broccoli and Liu 
teams. An sgRNA specific to dominant rhodopsin mutation was com-
bined with Cas9 VQR variant allowing specific disruption of the mutated 
gene (Giannelli et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ). Giannelli et al. deliver 
Cas9/sgRNA with and engineered vector AAV9-PHP using intravitreal 
injection. This strategy was also applying recently in RHO.P347S mice 
leading to partial recovery of photoreceptor function (Patrizi et al., 
2021 ). In addition to these studies in the retina, allele-specific PAM 
sequence present only in the mutated gene has been successfully used in 
the inner ear and in RP mouse models leading to the phenotypic im-
provements (Gyorgy et al., 2019 ) (Bakondi et al., 2016 ). 
It is important to note that this need of specificity leads to costly 
mutation dependent strategy, reducing the number of patients that can 
benefit from treatment. Moreover, it may lead to haploinsufficiency as it 
does not compensate for the inactivation of the mutant allele. In auto-
somal diseases with dominant negative effect, one of the alternatives is 
to non-specifically disrupt the two alleles using CRISPR Cas9 system. 
Latella et al. adapted this approach in their proof of concept study C. Botto et al.

14targeting the P23H mutation in transgenic mice thanks to two sgRNAs 
flanking the exon 1 of the gene leading to overall decrease of RHO gene 
expression. With the same strategy, Tsai et al., reported phenotype 
improvement in P23H and D190N mutations knock-in mouse models 
(Latella et al., 2016 ; Tsai et al., 2018 ). 
Proof of concept in an autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy 
(CORD6) has also been reported in mice and primates. A double AAV 
approach to deliver SpCas9 and sgRNA targeting the GUCY2D gene leads 
to a decrease of the expression of the two WT and mutated alleles. Thus, 
CRISPR Cas9 is a promising tool to develop a treatment for autosomal 
dominant diseases however, the second part consisting in the simulta -
neous replacement of the endogenous gene by a healthy gene has not 
been reported yet (McCullough et al., 2019 ). This is due to technical 
difficulties regarding delivery of an additional replacement cDNA 
requiring additional gene carriers and constraints. Instead of bringing 
additional healthy copies, it might be more advantageous to turn to gene 
correction (see below). 5.1.3.2. Gene editing for autosomal recessive RP.The gene editing stra-
tegies applied depend on the disease mechanisms surrounding the causal 
mutations. In terms of ease of application, the delivery of CRISPR Cas9 
and guide RNA to deliberately introduce cuts is the most straightforward 
approach compatible with existing vector technologies making it 
feasible in the retina. Indeed, saCas9 and its guide RNAs can be 
accommodated in a single AAV vector and be used to create indels or 
excise sequences containing mutations promoting read-throughs. An 
early example of the latter approach is the application of CRISPR Cas9 
mediated gene editing to recessive Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10 
(LCA10). Recessive LCA10 disease is caused by an intronic mutation in 
CEP290 gene generating a novel splice donor site. Recently Maeder et al. 
reported a double sgRNAs combined with SaCas9 approach to delete this 
intronic region in pre-clinical studies paving the way to clinical appli -
cation. The pre-clinical work showed safety and feasibility in non- 
immunosuppressed macaques after the delivery of the dual guide 
RNAs along with saCas9 by subretinal injection of and AAV5 vector with

Schematic representation of Indel creation using CRISPRCas9 in comparison to gene correction using base and prime editors. Cas9 protein is guided to a specific locus 
by its sgRNA to introduce double stranded breaks (upper panel). The mechanism of action for the base editors (middle panels) and prime editors (lower panel) do not 
require double stranded break formation. Base editing uses components from CRISPR systems together with other enzymes to directly install point mutations into 
cellular DNA or RNA. DNA base editors comprise a catalytically disabled nuclease fused to a nucleobase deaminase enzyme and, in some cases, a DNA glycosylase 
inhibitor. Prime editing uses a fusion protein, consisting of a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase enzyme, and a 
prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA), capable of identifying the target site and providing the new genetic information to replace the target DNA nucleotides. C. Botto et al.

receive the authorization to enter in clinical application. 
5.1.3.3. Mutation correction. First strategies based on CRISPR Cas9 
developed to promote precise mutation correction used the HDR 
pathway in the presence of exogenous DNA template. However, the HDR 
repair pathway is limited to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and 
could not achieve a satisfactory percentage of correction in post mitotic 
retinal cells. Several strategies have been developed to increase the ef-
ficiency of HDR pathway (Maruyama et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015). These 
methods tested in vitro have however limited applicability for in vivo 
therapy. Repair by NHEJ thus remains predominant in post-mitotic 
tissues and this needs to be considered in further developments of 
gene corrective strategies in the retina. 
Due to the low efficiency of HDR in post mitotic cells, gene correction 
mediated by has not been applied in vivo in the retina but has found vast 
applications in patient-derived iPS cells. 
The first strategy applied in vivo bypasses the HDR pathway by using 
the predominant NHEJ to perform an accurate repair. This technique 
called Homology independent targeted integration (HITI) was devel -
oped by the Belmonte group at the Salk Institute (Suzuki et al., 2016). To 
promote the insertion of a donor sequence, the Cas9/gRNA complex will 
target both the genome sequence and also two short sequences inserted 
on either side of the correction matrix (see Fig. 6). A proof of concept in 
vivo in a rat model for RP shows the possibility to correct homozygous 
mutation in the Mertk gene after injection of two HITI-AAVs (Suzuki 
et al., 2016). However, the repair of DSB also generates indels and re-
sults in a mosaic editing products in vivo restricting the application field 
of HITI to correct mutations in retinal disease. 
Most recent gene editing tools, base editing and prime editing, are 
promising to overcome these limitations by precisely correcting a mu-
tation in post-mitotic cells without causing DSB (see Fig. 6). A first study 
has already shown the possibility to apply a split base editor dual AAV 
strategy in vivo in the mouse retina (Levy et al., 2020). A second study 
recently applies ABE system to correct a de novo nonsense mutation in 
the Rpe65 gene of adult mice. After sub retinal injection of lentivirus 
expressing ABE protein and its sgRNA, 29% gene correction in the RPE 
with the restoration of the Rpe65 expression and minimal formation of 
indels or off target mutations is reported in this recent study (Suh et al., 
2021). 
New editing systems have been finding their applications in the 
retina and each reveal different constraints and advantages. Base editing 
allows a precise correction of point mutations or SNPs at a targeted 
location in the genomic DNA. They are composed of a Cas9 protein and a 
deaminase which will respectively allow to precisely target a sequence 
in the genome and convert one nucleotide to another without any cut-
ting activity. Two classes of base editors exist to date: cytidine base 
editors (CBE) (Komor et al., 2016) which convert C.G. nucleotides into 
A.T. and adenine base editors (ABE) which convert A.T. nucleotides into 
C.G. (Gaudelli et al., 2017). These two editors allow the correction of 
61% of pathogenic point mutations and are being continually improved 
(Thuronyi et al., 2019). 
Anzalone et al. recently reported a new tool derived from CRISPR 
system called prime editing and composed of a Cas9n (Cas9 H840A 
nickase) merged with a reverse transcriptase. This complex is guided by 
an RNA called pegRNA for prime editing guide RNA which recognizes 
the targeted DNA site and contains the correct sequence. This recent tool 
allows correction of point mutations without causing double-stranded 
cuts and can also correct short deletions or insertions. The correction 
capacity of this system is sufficient to cover more than 89% of known 
pathogenic mutations. Compared to recombination correction, the more 
efficient prime edition generates very small unwanted editions at the cut 
site and appears to generate fewer unwanted off-target cuts (Anzalone 
et al., 2019). Validations on cell lines and primary cultures of neurons, 
applications in vivo are underway. 5.1.3.4. Gene independent strategies by CRISPR Cas9. CRISPR-Cas9 can 
also enable a large spectrum of targeted in situ gene regulation func-
tionalities, by transcriptional repression or activation of genes in vivo. 
Such in vivo gene-repression-mediated gene therapy for retinitis pig-
mentosa has been proposed by two groups. Moreno and coworkers 
engineered targeted repression of Nrl, a master regulator of rod photo -
receptor determination mediating in situ reprogramming of rod cells 
into cone-like cells that are resistant to retinitis pigmentosa-specific 
mutations. Such in vivo epigenome engineering enables a cone sparing 
intervention that is potentially reversible. This technique was imple -
mented by using a dual AAV approach to deliver SpCas9 and sgRNA sub- 
retinally in three mouse models developed (Yu et al., 2017; Moreno 
et al., 2018). These two studies report the feasibility of a gene inde-
pendent strategy using CRISPR cas9 tools to develop a universal treat-
ment for IRDs in early stages of the disease. 
5.2. Stage 2 and 3 therapies 
In early phases of stage 2, rod numbers have decreased but central 
cones are still viable and patients retain central vision, a therapeutic 
approach should aim at (1) slowing down photoreceptor degeneration, 
(2) preserving cone function in the fovea. One way to address the first 
two points is by providing the retina with neuroprotection(Wubben 
et al., 2019). Neurotrophic factors are small molecules, mostly peptides, 
that promote cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and survival with 
either an autocrine or a paracrine effect (Kolomeyer and Zarbin, 2014). 
Several peptides, such as ciliary-derived trophic factor (CNTF) and 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (Faktorovich et al., 1990; Joly et al., 
2007) glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Frasson et al., 1999; 
Dalkara et al., 2011), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) 
(Barnstable and Tombran-Tink, 2006) and brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) (Okoye et al., 2003; McGill et al., 2007) have been proved 
to be beneficial for the maintenance of ONL thickness and for the overall 
photoreceptor survival. Although some of these generic trophic factors 
stimulating cell proliferation and promoting growth in differentiated 
cells, they can also have adverse effects on specialized photoreceptor cell 
function. The processes they mediate are energy-intensive, and conse -
quently upregulate glucose metabolism. GDNF and BDNF have shown 
positive effects on both survival and function of the outer retina likely by 
these mechatnisms but others like CNTF lead to decrease in photore -
ceptor function albeit preserving anatomy. Trophic factors more rele-
vant to rod cone dystrophy have been identified that help overcome 
these hurdles. The identification of one mechanism that causes vision 
loss in rod-cone dystrophies revealed a signaling molecule called 
Rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) that represents a promising 
therapy specific for this disease mechanism(Leveillard and Sahel, 2010). 
RdCVF, maintains the function and the viability of cone photoreceptor 
cells in the retina by stimulating glycolysis; and mice that lack this factor 
exhibit a progressive loss of photoreceptor cells(Aït-Ali et al., 2015). The 
gene encoding RdCVF also encodes, by differential splicing, a second 
product that has characteristics of a thioredoxin-like enzyme and pro-
tects both rod and cone photoreceptor cells against oxidative damage via 
its interacting protein partner, the tau protein(Byrne et al., 2015; Mei 
et al., 2016). This signaling pathway links environmental insults that 
occur during neurodegeneration to an endogenous neuroprotective 
response. Expression of RdCVF has been proven beneficial in several 
animal models, and an RdCVF-based gene therapy is currently being 
developed for clinical application. 
Focusing on targeting the biological pathways that cause the cones’ 
death is now recognized to be an attractive strategy for promoting cone 
survival and it has been pursued by other groups(Ramachandran et al., 
2015). Today it is accepted that several mechanisms contribute to cone 
death like hyperoxia and lack of energy mentioned above; and a lack of 
intermediates in the anabolic processes by which large molecules are 
synthesized from smaller ones and more gene therapy approaches are 
being developed targeting these pathways. In such a quest, C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
16hyperactivation of the protein complex mTOR1, which controls cell 
metabolism has been shown to increase cone survival( Punzo et al., 
2009 ). This protein complex probably acts by promoting the expression 
of genes that improve glucose uptake and use, raising levels of anabolic 
intermediates and of an anabolic cofactor molecule called NADPH. 
Adequate levels of NADPH are important to cone survival because, as 
they play roles in anabolic processes, and pathways that detoxify ROS in 
hyperoxic retinas. Injection of antioxidants or viral-vector delivery of 
genes that fight oxidation prolong cone survival in mouse models of 
retinitis pigmentosa, supporting the theory that oxidation is a cause of 
cone death. 
Another targeted neuroprotective approach has been developed to 
increase the endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms by expression 
of genes that combat oxidation. The Cepko group has used vectors 
encoding the transcription factors NRF2 and/or PGC1a, which regulate 
genes that combat oxidation, stress, or enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase, which directly detoxify radical oxygen 
species (ROS)( Xiong et al., 2015 ). They tested the effectiveness of this 
approach in several rodent models of photoreceptor degeneration with 
positive outcomes. AAV-mediated delivery of NRF2 was more effective 
than SOD2 and catalase, while expression of PGC1a accelerated photo -
receptor death. Since the NRF2-mediated neuroprotective effects 
extended to photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells, which are 2 very 
different types of neurons, these results suggest that this targeted 
approach may be broadly applicable in retinitis pigmentosa and other 
diseases where cells suffer from oxidative damage. In a parallel line of 
research, Venkatesh et al. explored the development of nutrient depri -
vation( Venkatesh et al., 2015 ). Venkatesh et al. constitutively activated 
components of the mTOR pathway specifically in cone cells in rd1 mice 
and determined that activation of mTORC1 markedly improved cone 
survival, function, and morphology. Moreover, mTORC1 activation 
increased expression of the metabolic genes responsible for glucose 
uptake, retention, and utilization and promoted NADPH production, 
which likely reduced ROS and prevented apoptosis. Thus, mTORC1 
activation acts in several different ways to increase cone survival — by 
increasing glucose metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and prevent -
ing apoptosis. 
More recent work by Wang et al. demonstrate that AAV-mediated 
overexpression of TGF- β1 promotes cone survival and function in 3 
distinct RP models with rod-specific mutations( Wang et al., 2020 ). 
TGF- β1 induces microglia to metabolically tune from a glycolytic 
phenotype (M1) to an oxidative phenotype (M2), which associates with 
neuroprotection and the anti-inflammatory ecosystem. A protective 
system including the anti-inflammatory system is a new outlook in 
neuroprotection in RP. Consolidating the results of this study with cur-
rent understanding of how TGF- β1 regulates microglia polarization, this 
work once more highlights cell-specific metabolome reprogramming 
and adds to a growing panoply of promising non-gene-specific thera -
peutic interventions in development for inherited retinal degenerations. 
As the degeneration progresses, however, cone outer segments are 
lost in the central retina as well, and optogenetic approaches aimed at 
restoring light sensitivity in dormant cones can be envisioned (Fig. 7). 
Since in healthy retinas photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to a 
light stimulus, the idea is to provide remaining cones with microbial 
opsins capable of hyperpolarizing the membrane without the need for 
the intricate phototransduction cascade occurring in the outer segment. 
This approach was first successfully developed by Busskamp et al. 
through the expression of an enhanced version of halorhodopsin 
(eNpHR) from Natronomonas pharaonis in a mouse model of retinal 
degeneration( Busskamp et al., 2010 ). The presence of the chloride pump 
allowed dormant cones to regain their function, resulting in the detec -
tion of light-evoked currents at the level of RGCs, in the restoration of 
ON and OFF responses, and in visual-guided behaviors in treated mice. 
Notably, treated human retinal explants expressed eNpHR and respon -
ded to light stimuli( Busskamp et al., 2010 ; Fradot et al., 2011 ). 
Further research led to the engineering of a more efficient hyperpolarizing microbial opsin, named Jaws, with a peak absorption at 
600 nm (Chuong et al., 2014 ). When injected in a blind mouse model for 
retinal degeneration, Jaws was expressed in dormant cones and 
correctly restored ON and OFF responses at ganglion cell’s level upon 
light stimulation. Higher spiking rates and higher sensitivity was 
observed in RGCs of Jaws-injected retinas compared to RGCs of 
eNpHR-injected retinas. Notably, when coupled to a cone-specific pro-
moter and injected in macaque retina, Jaws showed robust response to 
light stimuli with orange light showing clinical feasibility for this 
approach (Khabou, Cordeau, et al., 2018 ). 
5.3. Stage 4 therapies 
In the last stage of retinal degeneration, almost the entirety of pho-
toreceptors might be lost, in which case the RPE invades the subretinal 
space and the inner retina undergoes remodeling and rewiring (Marc 
and Jones, 2003 ). In this scenario, a different group of therapies aiming 
to compensate photoreceptor function are used. Optogenetics is once 
again implemented here but this time to generate currents in normally 
light-insensitive second and third order neurons. 
Among the microbial opsins (also called mOpsins, or Type 1 opsins), 
channelrhodopsin played a central role in the development of the first 
strategies for vision restoration. In a first pioneering study, mouse 
models for retinal degeneration were injected with an AAV vector cod-
ing for ChR2 (Bi et al., 2006 ). Protein expression was observed in the 
inner retina eliciting light-driven currents. Visual-evoked potentials 
(VEPs) could be recorded in the cortex of treated mice, proving the 
validity of this innovative approach in restoring visual information flow 
to the brain. RGCs have been successfully targeted with ChR2, both in 
rat and in mouse models (Bi et al., 2006 ; Tomita et al., 2014 ). Following 
small animal studies focused on increasing the information processing of 
the inner retina targeting specific subsets of inner retinal neurons such as 
ON bipolar cells (Doroudchi et al., 2011 ; Cronin et al., 2014 ; Mac˘e et al., 
2015 ). However, the light intensity required to activate ChR2 is close the 
regulatory limits for the human retina imposed by the international 
commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP, 2013). To 
increase the safety of this approach, researchers turned to more sensitive 
and red-shifted opsins. A red-shifted channelrhodopsin, VChR1, with a 
peak response of ~530 nm from Volvox carteri (Zhang et al., 2008 ), was 
first used (Tsunoda et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011 ). ReaChR, an 
improved version of VChR1 with a peak response of ~590 –630 nm (Lin 
et al., 2013 ) was able to restore light responses in blind mice and, 
notably, to induce spike responses in RGCs macaque and human samples 
(Sengupta et al., 2016 ). Light intensity used to activate ReaChR was well 
below the limits set for the human retina, possibly eliminating the need 
of goggles and making it a good candidate for human application. 
Another red-shifted microbial opsin, ChrimsonR, showed great promise 
as it restored RGC activity in living primates (Gauvain et al., 2021 ). 
Following the success of these studies, Channelrhodopsin-based gene 
therapy approach for vision restoration are currently being tested in 
several clinical trials (NCT02556736, NCT03326336, NCT04278131). 
Despite their success and recent year ’s improvements, channelrho -
dopsins are still unable to match light sensitivity and adaptation pro-
vided by our vision based on vertebrate opsins ’ (also known as vOpsins, 
or Type 2 opsins). vOpsins are seven-transmembrane-domain proteins 
belonging to the G-protein coupled receptors family (GPCRs), and are 
normally used in vertebrates for vision and light-related tasks (Fig. 7) 
(Simon et al., 2020 ). In the human eye, rod opsin (rhodopsin) and cone 
opsins are coupled to a chromophore, the 11-cis-retinal. When hit by a 
photon, the chromophore is converted into all-trans-retinal causing a 
conformational change in the opsin, triggering a phototransduction 
cascade, ultimately leading to cellular hyperpolarization. The rationale 
behind the choice of vOpsins as optogenetic tools for vision restoration is 
that downstream effectors of the phototransduction cascade are com-
mon to inner retinal neurons, since they also rely on GPCRs, although for 
different tasks. The activation of the opsin upon light stimulation would C. Botto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
17therefore trigger a similar cascade to the one existing in photoreceptors, 
but this time culminating with the opening of a cation channel which 
would depolarize the cell and transmit the signal to downstream neu-
rons. Among the different vOpsins, melanopsin was the first one to be 
used for vision restoration. Melanopsin is already expressed in a 
sub-population of intrinsically light-sensitive RGCs that are responsible 
for controlling and tuning the circadian rhythm (Xue et al., 2011 ). In a 
first study, melanopsin was expressed ectopically in RGCs (Lin et al., 
2008 ). Treated blind mice showed improved pupillary reflex and 
restored their capability of discriminating light from dark. The light 
intensity required to elicit these responses was considerably lower than 
the one needed to activate ChR2. Despite the improvements, however, 
melanopsin ’s kinetics proved to be too slow for movie-rate vision. 
Other studies attempted to rescue vision using chimeric light- 
activated GPCRs in blind mice. In early work by the Kleinlogel group, 
a chimera between mouse melanopsin and the mGluR6 receptor (Opto- 
mGluR6) was created and expressed in ON-bipolar cells of blind mice (van Wyk et al., 2015 ). mGluR6 is a Gi/o coupled receptor and specif -
ically expressed in the retinal ON-bipolar cells in the retina. It mediates 
light responses via closing of TRPM1 cation channels. AAV mediated 
expression of Opto-mGluR6 was restricted to ON-bipolar cells using a 
specific promoter. This expression converts the ON-bipolar cell into an 
OFF-cell, since glutamate release in the dark activates mGluR6. This 
effect could be observed in the electroretinogram where the b- wave of 
the ERG was inverted in comparison to control mice. Opto-mGluR6 
mediated light responses were recorded in ON-bipolar cells, RGCs and 
visual cortex in this work. Another vOpsin, rhodopsin, has been suc-
cessfully expressed in ON bipolar cells of a mouse model for retinal 
degeneration, taking advantage of the cell-specific promoter 4xgrm6 
(Gaub et al., 2015 ). As for melanopsin, rhodopsin proved to be more 
sensitive than ChR2, and restored visually-evoked potentials in the 
cortex along with basic visually-guided behaviors. However, the tem-
poral resolution was low, probably due to a suboptimal working envi-
ronment for the opsin. In order to obtain better temporal resolution,

Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 86 (2022) 100975
18cone opsins were implemented by the same group for vision restoration 
approaches in the inner retina(Berry et al., 2019). In a recent study, 
mouse medium-wavelength sensitive opsin (mMWO) was expressed in 
RGCs of blind rd1 mice (Berry et al., 2019). mMWO responses were one 
log faster as compared to rhodopsin when expressed in RGCs of degen -
erated retinas. 
To summarize, substantial efforts were made internationally in the 
development of gene therapy approaches for vision restoration at late 
stages of retinal degeneration. mOpsins, and vOpsins, have been 
implemented in preclinical models and are now transitioning towards 
clinical applications and industrial development. mOpsins can be 
controlled with millisecond-scale precision but suffer from low light 
sensitivity, requiring light-intensifying goggles to be functional. On the 
other hand, vOpsins are considerably more sensitive, thanks to the 
signal amplification provided by the GPCR mechanism, but have lower 
temporal resolution compared to mOpsins. We also know less about 
their intracellular targets and how their behavior changes from one cell 
type to another. Current and future clinical trials will inform us on the 
most suitable option for vision restoration in patients whose outer 
retinal layers have been lost to degeneration. 
6.Future directions and conclusions 
Monogenic inherited retinal degenerations are caused by mutations 
in genes associated with biochemical or physiological pathways neces -
sary for normal function of retinal cells. Gene replacement (addition or 
supplementation) therapy involves transporting a healthy copy of the 
defective gene under the control of a promoter active in the affected cells 
of the retina(Sahel et al., 2019). The gene is carried by a vector and 
administered in proximity of retinal cells by an intravitreal or subretinal 
injection. The most efficient and safe gene delivery vectors are AAVs, 
they offer a 4.7-kilobase carrying capacity. First successful imple -
mentation of AAV mediated gene augmentation therapy is the case of 
Luxturna for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa or Leber congenital 
amaurosis associated with RPE65 and a dozen other clinical trials are 
underway to tackle other monogenic recessive diseases of the retina 
using this strategy. However, there are many other larger IRD genes that 
exceed the carriage capacity of AAV and mutations causing retinal 
degeneration by a dominant negative effect. Methods to safely and 
specifically edit the endogenous DNA or RNA are likely to be crucial in 
tackling these remaining mutations in the years to come. Clinical trials 
thus far have not targeted autosomal-dominant mutations causing 
retinal degeneration due to the complexity of silence and replace stra-
tegies but will likely become plausible with gene editing using Crispr 
Cas9. The implementation of this versatile gene editing system has been 
quick with a clinical trial underway for the treatment of type 10 Leber 
congenital amaurosis caused by recessive mutations in the CEP290 gene 
(Sahel and Dalkara, 2019). Both gene replacement and gene editing 
offer incredibly promising outcomes for patients treated early on in 
disease onset, prior to degeneration of the photoreceptors. Unfortu -
nately, most patients who are followed in rare disease centers today are 
past this point where gene editing or gene addition can provide thera -
peutic benefit. The great majority of inherited retinal degenerations are 
highly progressive making it necessary to foresee a treatment based on 
the patient’s phenotype at the point at which an intervention can be 
made(Sahel et al., 2013). For this reason, and for our incomplete 
knowledge of the multitude of mutations leading to rod-cone dystrophy, 
the most prevalent IRD, alternative gene therapies need to be developed 
that can treat patients independently of the causal mutations. These 
include gene therapies leading to the secretion of neuroprotective agents 
or proteins acting on metabolic, inflammatory and nutritional pathways 
and those that can activate remaining neurons in the visual pathway 
such as optogenetics. The major challenges in the implementation of 
these late stage therapies will be to measure and understand the effects 
of such therapies requiring brain plasticity and to demonstrate the 
positive impact of vision preservation or restoration in treated patients. The quantification of a therapeutic can pose challenges in these diseases 
where vision is very low at baseline as traditional tests in ophthalmology 
are centered on the ability to read lines of letters on an eye chart. This 
standard reflects the function of the foveal cone cells that and do not 
account for aspects of vision carried out by the majority of the retina 
residing outside the fovea. Future developments in our methods of 
evaluation of low vision along with development of more sophisticated 
instruments for objective measures is going to be key to the achievement 
of such therapies. 
Finally, there are large phenotypic variations in rod-cone dystrophy 
that needs to be taken into account when considering the most beneficial 
treatment for a patient. Retinal imaging and deep phenotyping can aid 
in determining a gene therapy approach with the most promise in terms 
of visual improvements and longevity. The variety of gene therapies 
developed require gene delivery to different cell types. As safety data 
accumulate on new vectors and routes of administration, regulatory 
bodies may reduce the regulatory burden. This, along with anticipated 
developments in manufacturing practices of core technologies such as 
AAVs will likely reduce the cost of clinical trials in the years to come. 
Recent developments in retinal gene therapy are already very encour -
aging, and this has attracted significant interest from scientists, clini-
cians and industry working in the field. This interest and investment will 
enable the stakeholders to tackle the remaining challenges in this 
promising avenue over the decade to come. The multitude of knowledge 
generated from studies on IRDs could help developing of gene thera -
peutic strategies for more common complex degenerative disorders like 
AMD.
