Abstract figure legend . Optogenetic approaches for vision restoration in end-stage retinal degeneration. In inherited
retinal degenerations, there is progressive loss of photoreceptors (rods and cones) but inner retinal structures remain
largely intact. Optogenetic strategies aim to induce light sensitivity in remaining retinal cells using gene therapy,
via ectopic expression of an opsin gene. The most widely investigated approach uses retinal transduction via an
adeno-associated virus injected either into the subretinal space or via intravitreal injection, with the aim of vision
restoration(GC,ganglioncell;BC,bipolarcell;AC,amacrinecell;HC,horizontalcell;RC,residualcones;RPE,retinal

Introduction
The inherited retinal degenerations are a heterogeneous
group of disorders that result in photoreceptor cell
dysfunction and cell death, leading to severe visual
impairment. They affect around one in 4000 people and,
with rare exceptions, there are no effective therapies
(Verbakeletal.,2018).Theymaybeinheritedasanauto-
somaldominant,autosomalrecessiveorX-linkedtraitand
somerareformsareassociatedwithmutationsinmDNA.
Although most of these diseases are confined to the eye,
some are associated with systemic features, when the

tissues. Interestingly some mutations in ubiquitously
expressedgenescangiverisetoaretinaonlyphenotype.
More than 250 different causative genes have been
identified (https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/sum-dis.htm) and
this great heterogeneity has complicated attempts to
develop effective treatment. Many different approaches
have been tried, including the use of gene targeted
therapies,neuroprotectiveagents,optogenetics,celltrans-
plantation, stem cell therapy and retinal implants (Dias
et al., 2018). Gene targeted therapies rely on a precise
moleculargeneticdiagnosisandgenerallywillbeeffective
only for the gene of interest, with some approaches
utilizing CRISPR or antisense oligonucleotides targeting
only a specific mutation (Nuzbrokh et al., 2021). For
a disorder caused by more than 250 genes and with

probably effective early in the disease when significant

is extensive photoreceptor cell death or photoreceptor
structure has been lost. However, many patients have
severe disease at presentation and, given that there has
beenlittleeffectivetherapytodate,therearemanypatients
withlate-stagedisease.
Significantly more patients could be helped by the
development of treatments that are less influenced by
the specific genetic cause and which could still work
in late-stage disease to restore visual function. Evidence
from animal models (Mazzoni et al., 2008) and human
post-mortem specimens (Humayun et al., 1999; Santos
et al., 1997) indicates relative preservation of inner
retinal structures and circuitry even in advanced stages
of inherited retinal degeneration. Several gene agnostic
approaches have been investigated for the purpose of
vision restoration, including cell transplantation, stem
cell therapy, retinal implants and optogenetics. Each
has reached the stage of clinical trials after extensive
preclinical studies. Cell transplantation and stem cell
therapy aim to support residual viable photoreceptors
and develop new populations of light sensitive cells. By
contrast, optogenetic approaches and retinal implants
bypass host photoreceptors to stimulate remaining inner
retinal neurons and post-receptoral pathways. The latter
comprise arrays of electrodes or photodiodes that are

Optogenetics
Optogenetics is a method of neuromodulation that has
wide applicability in neuroscience. It involves the use of
lighttoactivateapopulationofcellsmadephotosensitive
via ectopic expression of an opsin protein (Zemelman
et al., 2002). The first reports utilised the expression of a
combinationof Drosophila photoreceptorgenestoinduce
lightsensitivityinmammalianneurones(Zemelmanetal.,
2002) and several other optogenetic tools have sub-
sequently been developed. Given that the conversion of
light to electrical activity occurs in the eye when light
triggersphototransductioninrodsandcones,anintuitive
application of optogenetic techniques is to induce light
sensitivityintheremaininginnerretinalcellsinend-stage

an effective optogenetic approach requires consideration
of multiple factors, including the characteristics of the
light-sensitive protein used, the vector for gene delivery
andthetargetcellforexpression.

into ion channels or ion pumps and G-protein coupled
receptors.
Ion channels
The use of light-gated ion channels or pumps is
advantageous for the purpose of vision restoration
because these do not require the presence of proteins
involved in a signalling cascade that may be absent,
or reduced, in advanced retinal degeneration.
Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a rhodopsin with a
microbial-type chromophore that was originally isolated
from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Nagel
et al., 2003; Sineshchekov et al., 2002). ChR2 is itself a
light-sensitive cation channel: incident light isomerises
itsall-transchromophore into 13- cisretinal inducing a
conformational change in ChR2, allowing cations intothecellleadingtodepolarisation(Nageletal.,2003).This
responseisrapidwithanonsetoflessthan50 μsafterlight
exposure(Hollandetal.,1996),makingChR2well-suited
for use as an optogenetic tool. ChR2 responds to light
of wavelength under 540 nm, with a peak sensitivity of
450 nm (Nagel et al., 2003), which is in the blue light
spectrum.
A disadvantage of ChR2 is the high stimulus intensity
required to obtain a response compared to rhodopsin or
coneopsins(1015photonscm–2s–1required forChR2 vs.
1010photonscm–2s–1forconesand106photonscm–2s–1
forrods) (Bi et al., 2006; Lagali et al., 2008)and this high
intensity of blue light may be damaging to the retina.
Another potential limitation is range: healthy photo-
receptors are able to respond to light intensities spanning
8logunits,whereasChR2responsesareseenovera2log
unitrange(Lagalietal.,2008).Therefore,animageorlight
processingdevicemayberequiredtoamplifydimlight,or
attenuateveryhighintensitylightforoptimalstimulation
ofChR2.
Given these limitations, engineered variants of ChR
have been developed such as calcium translocating
channelrhodopsin(orCatCh),whichhasimprovedlight
sensitivityandkineticscomparedtoChR(Kleinlogeletal.,
2011).Othernative(e.g.ChrimsonR)andengineeredChR
(e.g. red-light activated depolarizing ChR or ReaChR)
have peak sensitivity in the red light spectrum, and high
lightintensitiesofthesewavelengthsmaybelessdamaging
to the retina than similar intensities of blue light. Studies
have also explored the use of an engineered light-gated
ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR). This bears a
mutated cysteine residue, to which a photo switchable
tethered ligand can bind. Incident light of 380 nm causes
isomerisation of the photo switch and opening of the ion
channel,and500nmlightresultsinclosingofthechannel.
Expression of this optogenetic tool in murine degenerate
retinaresultedinrestorationofvisualresponses(Caporale
et al., 2011) and a second-generation ligand activated at
460 nm has also shown similar efficacy in mice and dogs
(Gaubetal.,2014).
Ion pumps
Halorhodopsin (NpHR) is a light-sensitive chloride
ion pump derived from Natronomonas pharaonis
halobacteria (Zhang et al., 2007). Light stimulation of
NpHR causes hyperpolarisation of the cell (similar to
the response of photoreceptors in the physiological
state) and its peak sensitivity is to a wavelength of
590 nm. Given its very fast activation and de-activation
kinetics (Han & Boyden, 2007), halorhodopsin has
good temporal characteristics for therapeutic use. An
enhanced variant (eNpHR) has also been developed that
permitshigherexpressionlevelswithoutinducingtoxicity

(Gradinaru et al., 2008). However, the stimulus intensity
required to obtain a light response is even higher than
that for ChR2 (1016photons cm–2s–1) (Busskamp et al.,
2010). Other ion pumps have also been investigated
such as the yellow–green light sensitive proton pump
archaerhodopsin or Arch (Chow et al., 2010), activation

a red shifted cruxhalorhodopsin, which showed greater
light sensitivity and ganglion cell spiking compared to
other hyperpolarising ion pumps following expression in
residual cone photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinal
degeneration(Chuongetal.,2014).
G-protein coupled receptors
Rhodopsin and cone opsins are found natively in rod
and cone photoceptors respectively and activation
of each leads to cell hyperpolarisation. They are
G-protein coupled, and this has the significant advantage
of permitting signal amplification. For example, a
single activated rhodopsin interacts with more than
800 molecules of its G-protein transducin, resulting
in the closure of more than 200 ion channels in the
photoreceptor outer segment disc membrane, from the
absorptionofonephotonalone(Purvesetal.,2001).This
signalamplificationmeansthatG-proteincoupledopsins
are sensitive to lower light intensities than ion channels,
and therefore could function as optogenetic tools (Berry
et al., 2019; Cehajic-Kapetanovic et al., 2015) without
the need for modification of the light stimulus required
by ChR2 and NpHR. In addition, ectopic expression of
these native proteins has a lower probability of incurringan immune response when injected into the eye than
microbialopsins.
A further mammalian opsin, melanopsin, has also
been investigated, which is present in a subset of
mammalian cells named intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells. Melanopsin is also G-protein coupled
and photoisomerisation of 11- cisretinal results in
activation downstream signalling cascade causing cell
depolarisation, with responses in the physiological
light range (De Silva et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2008). It
may also be capable of coupling to ubiquitous cell
signalling pathways (Hankins et al., 2008) and therefore
probably functional when introduced into a new cell

et al., 2015) and a photo switch activated metabotropic
glutamatereceptor2(mGluR2)(Berryetal.,2017).
Target retinal cells
Animportantconsiderationindevelopinganoptogenetic
approach is whether to target expression of the photo-
sensitive protein to a specific retinal cell type or adopt a
ubiquitous approach, where the light-sensitive protein is
expressed in as wide a range of cells as possible (Fig. 1).

The latter has been widely investigated subsequent to

expression of ChR2 in a mouse model of retina
degeneration (Bi et al., 2006); multiple other studies
have also demonstrated similar efficacy (Dalkara et al.,
2013; De Silva et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2008; Tomita et al.,
2007). The rationale here is that the mixed visual signal
is interpreted via cortical processing, as is presumed to
b et h ec a s ew i t hr e t i n a li m p l a n t st h a th a v ea l s os h o w n
efficacy despite stimulating multiple retinal cell types
(Millsetal.,2017).
However, widespread expression of a light sensitive
protein in remaining retinal cells runs the potential risk
ofalossofsignalprocessing,limitingthequalityofvision
thatcouldberestored.Humanretinalcircuitryiscomplex:
cones synapse with 10 types of bipolar cell (ON and
OFF subtypes) and rods with one (ON subtype, the most
commonbipolarcelltypeintheretina).Thismultiplicity
of connections allows for image processing and the
creationofONandOFFpathways,wherealightstimulus
excites one population of cells and inhibits another.
Theseconnectionsarefurthermodifiedbyhorizontalcells
to mediate contrast sensitivity. Cone ON bipolar cells
synapse with ON ganglion cells, and OFF bipolar cells
synapse with OFF ganglion cells, respectively. Rod ON
bipolar cells synapse with amacrine cells, which in turn
provide inhibitory input to OFF ganglion cells. There are
atleast25typesofamacrinecellandmorethan17typesof
ganglioncellintheprimateretina,withvaryingfunctions
that facilitate our complex visual responses (Grunert &
Martin,2020).
Some optogenetic strategies therefore aim to pre-
serve as much signal processing as possible within
the retina, by targeting the most upstream remaining
cells (e.g. bipolar cells or residual cones) to more
closely mimic the retinal circuitry that is normally
stimulated by light. In vivostudies using murine models
of retinal degeneration have demonstrated successful
targeting of eNpHR to hyperpololarise residual cones
(Busskamp et al., 2010) and ChR2 to depolarise ON
bipolar cells (Doroudchi et al., 2011; Lagali et al., 2008).
However, hyperpolarising opsins (e.g. rhodopsin) have
been also been selectively expressed in ON bipolar cells
in mouse models with restoration of visual responses
(Cehajic-Kapetanovic et al., 2015). Precisely how the
visual signal would be interpreted in the latter situation
is unclear, given reversal of polarity, although there is
evidence to suggest that visual responses were mediated
via light-dependent disinhibition of ganglion cell firing
(Cehajic-Kapetanovic et al., 2015). Alternative strategies
specifically target the ganglion cell (Berry et al., 2019;
Sengupta et al., 2016) because this cell type is pre-
served even in end-stage disease, but again compromise
on bypassing the signal processing capacity within
theretina.Delivery of optogenetic agents to the retina
The most widely investigated approach for delivery
of the opsin protein to cells of the degenerate retina
is via gene therapy vectors such as adeno-associated
viral vectors (AAV). These vectors have been used in
human gene supplementation therapy clinical trials and
in a Food and Drug Administration and European
Medicines Agency approved retinal gene replacement
therapy named voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), for an
early-onset, severe retinal degeneration (as a result of
biallelicvariantsin RPE65)(Maguireetal.,2019).AAVare
single-strandedDNAparvovirusesthatarenotassociated
with pathogenicity in humans, and have a genome of
∼4.7 kb consisting of two genes on either side of which
lies a palindromic region known as an inverted terminal
repeat (ITR). These native genes can be replaced with a
transgeneofinterestandregulatoryelements,suchasthe
coding sequence of an opsin gene. A limitation of AAV
gene therapy is the size of genetic material than can be
packaged within the AAV capsid, which is under 5 kb.
However, given that opsin genes are comparatively small,
this limited packaging capacity does not significantly
impactoptogeneticgenetherapyapproaches.
The AAV vector can be further altered to influence
efficacyofexpressionandtargetcelltypebymodifyingits
capsid and promoter sequence amongst other elements.
More than 100 AAV serotypes have been described
(Lebherz et al., 2008), of which AAV2, AAV3 and AAV5
are endemic to humans (Gao et al., 2002). To increase
transduction efficiency and change cellular tropism,
vectors have been pseudotyped in which the ITRs of one
serotype are packaged in the capsid of another serotype
(Rabinowitz et al., 2002). For example, packaging AAV2
ITRs in an AAV8 capsid (generating a rAAV2/8 vector)
confers the safety and efficient expression of rAAV2 with
thetropismofAAV8.rAAV2/2andrAAV2/8arebothable
totransduceganglioncellsfollowingintravitrealinjection,
and rAAV2/2, rAAV2/5 and rAAV2/8 are able to trans-
ducephotoreceptors(Lebherzetal.,2008).
Bipolar cells have been particularly difficult to target
using AAV vectors, possibly as a result of viral particles
being degraded within the retina before they access
this layer. Modification of the capsid VP3 protein,
specifically point mutation of tyrosine (Y) residues to
phenylalanine (F), can significantly improve the ability
of AAV to penetrate the retina and increase transgene
expression (Zhong et al., 2008). A single mutation in
rAAV2/8(Y733F) was demonstrated to result in bipolar
celltransductioninthe rd10(Doroudchietal.,2011)and
rd1mouse model of retinal degeneration (De Silva et al.,
2016) and the rAAV2/2 quadruple and pentuple mutants
are able to transduce bipolar cells when delivered either
subretinallyorintravitreallyinwild-typemice(Petrs-Silva
et al., 2011). A novel vector developed by targeted

Conventionally, the AAV vector has been delivered
via subretinal injection to target outer retinal cells
(e.g. residual photoreceptors or bipolar cells) and via
intravitreal injection to target ganglion cells. Subretinal
injectionissurgicallymorechallenging.Itisperformedin
the operating theatre and requires intraocular surgery to
remove the vitreous (vitrectomy), as well as penetration
of the retina using a fine gauge needle followed by sub-
retinal injection of the virus. There are associated small
risks of retinal detachment, bleeding, infection (end-
ophthalmitis), inflammation, raised intraocular pressure
and developing cataract; however, this method allows for
concentrated vector delivery to an area directly adjacent
to the residual outer retina, and is the method of
injectionfortheFoodandDrugAdministrationapproved
Luxturna(Maguire etal.,2019).Intravitrealinjectionisa
commonly performed procedure in clinical care and can
be performed in a suitable room in a clinical setting. It
involves direct injection through the sclera at the pars
plana, with subsequent injection of the drug into the
vitreous cavity. However, dilution of virions within the
vitreouscavitymayreducetransduction.
More recently, a directed evolution approach has been
utilised to generate new AAV variants, by screening a
library of capsid types generated in the laboratory and
isolating the best AAV candidate. Using this approach,
an AAV vector named 7m8 was identified that enabled
transductionofphotoreceptors(Dalkaraetal.,2013)and
bipolar cells (Mace et al., 2015) following intravitreal
delivery in mouse retina, with transduction of primate
retina also being demonstrated in the former study.
However, compared with intravitreal vector delivery in
mouse models where widespread retinal transduction is
often seen, a much smaller area of retina seems to be
transduced in primates, largely in the parafoveal region
(Ivanova et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2011). This reduction
is presumed to be the result of a thicker inner limiting
membrane in primates forming a greater barrier to virus
particles than in the murine retina. Novel AAV vectors
suchas7m8doimprovetransductionintheprimateretina
(Byrne et al., 2020; Dalkara et al., 2013), although this is
stillnotaswidespreadasinmousemodels.
Alongside modification of the AAV capsid protein,
alterationofthepromotercanenabletargetingofdifferent
cell populations. Many studies have used ubiquitous
promoters to express the light sensitive protein in
a wide range of retinal cells. An example of this
is the CAG promoter [comprising a cytomegalovirus
enhancer (C), chicken beta actin promoter (A) and
splice acceptor of the rabbit beta globin gene (G)],
which has been demonstrated to facilitate effective
transduction of the degenerate retina (Bi et al., 2006;Dalkara et al., 2013; De Silva et al., 2017). Sub-
sequently,cell-specificpromoterssuchas Grm6-SV40 (the
grm6gene being that which encodes the metabotropic
glutamate receptor associated with ON bipolar cells)
have successfully targeted expression to ON bipolar cells
(Cehajic-Kapetanovic et al., 2015; Doroudchi et al., 2011;
Lagali et al., 2008). The combination of this promoter
withnewerAAVcapsidtypesfurtherimprovesbipolarcell
transduction (Mace et al., 2015) and modifications of the
Grm6-SV40 promoter have also been investigated, either
using multiple repeats or additional intronic sequences

Clinical trials
More than a decade of research into optogenetic
approaches for vision restoration has led to at least four
ongoing clinical trials in this area (https://clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=optogenetic&cntry=
&state=&city=&dist=). The patients most suitable for
thesetherapiesarethosewithadvancedvisualloss(visual
acuity of hand movements or perception of light only)
but with relatively intact inner retinal structures on
optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans (Fig. 2).
Primaryoutcomemeasuresoftheseclinicaltrialsinclude
safety and tolerability, and secondary outcome measures
include assessment of visual function such as perception
of light, visual acuity, full field threshold stimulus test,
determiningdirectionofmotion,identificationofobjects,
evaluationofmobilityandqualityoflife.
The first trial was led by RetroSense Therapeutics,
now a part of Allergan, which began recruitment
in 2015 (NCT02556736), investigating intravitreal
delivery of ChR2 using an AAV2 vector in 14 patients.
Few data have been released regarding outcomes:
no serious adverse effects were reported, although
one of 14 subjects was documented to have vitreal
cells and one out of 14 subjects was documented to
have vitritis; however, it is not clear whether these
outcomes were noted in the same patient (https:
//clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02556736?
term=channelrhodopsin&draw=2&rank=3). A phase
1/2a trial by GenSight Biologics named PIONEER
(NCT03326336) commenced recruitment in 2017, and
reported outcomes from the first patient in 2021 (Sahel
et al., 2021). This study assessed intravitreal injection
of an AAV2/7m8 vector, expressing a modified channel
rhodopsin(ChrimsonR)underthecontrolofaubiquitous
CAG promoter, in combination with a medical device
incorporating light stimulating goggles. Patients were
also given visual training using the goggles, beginning

4 months post-injection, to allow time for stabilisation
of ChrimsonR in ganglion cells. The reported patient
completed15suchsessionsand,7monthsafterinjection,
showedanimprovementinvisualfunctionsuchthatthey
were able to perceive, locate and touch different objects
using their treated eye alone whilst wearing goggles.
Electroencephalographic recordings demonstrated
activity in the visual cortex corresponding to these
objects and visual perception. The patient could not
detect any objects without goggles (or with the goggles
prior to injection), indicating the need for light stimulus
augmentation using this optogenetic tool. There was
no evidence of intraocular inflammation in this patient

Another clinical trial of optogenetic therapy uses
an alternative channel rhodopsin named ChronosFP
in combination with a prosthetic device (Bionic

Conclusions
Optogenetic therapies are one of several approaches
in clinical trials for restoration of visual responses in
advanced retinal degeneration. They have the advantage
of being independent of the underlying disease-causing
gene, and multiple reports have now demonstrated proof
of principle in animal models (McClements et al., 2020;
Simunovic etal., 2019).The firstclinical trials areunder-
way in patients, with initial reports indicating safety,
improvedlightsensitivity,andtheabilitytodetectmotion
andlargerobjects.
However, several challenges remain, including the
relativelylowlightsensitivitythatisafeatureofmanyion
channelsorionpumpsusedasoptogenetictools,resulting
in the need for augmentation of the light stimulus via
gogglesorstimulatingglasses.Inaddition,achievinghigh
levels of transduction in the primate or human retina
remains a challenge, and the ability to target specific

circuitry as closely as possible, is not yet well developed.
How much precise targeting is required, and whether
ubiquitous approaches are equally effective is currently
unclear.
A further consideration is the role of retinal
remodelling, which is a series of complex processes
that occur in the degenerate retina. This includes glial
hypertrophy, which may affect AAV penetration of the
retina and transduction efficacy. Other changes include
‘rewiring’, in which neurons extend new processes that
alterretinalcircuitry,and‘reprogramming’,wherethereis
switchingofbipolarcellclasses(Pfeifferetal.,2020).The
impact of these altered cellular connections and circuitry
on the potential visual response that can be restored via
optogenetic methods is currently unknown, as well as
whethercorticalprocessingmightadequatelycompensate
forthesechanges.
Many of the answers to these questions may become
clearer as we move further from bench to bedside since
assessments of visual function and visual perception
can be performed with far greater accuracy in patients.
Knowledge generated in these trials may, in turn, lead to
refinementofoptogenetictoolsandoptimisationofimage
processingtechnology ,withtheaimofrestoringvisionin
