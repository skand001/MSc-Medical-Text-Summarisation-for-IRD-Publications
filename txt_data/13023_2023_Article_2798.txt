Abstract 
Background Non-syndromic inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) such as retinitis pigmentosa or Leber congenital 
amaurosis generally manifest between early childhood and late adolescence, imposing profound long-term impacts 
as a result of vision impairment or blindness. IRDs are highly heterogeneous, with often overlapping symptoms 
among different IRDs, and achieving a definite diagnosis is challenging. This narrative review provides a clinical 
overview of the non-syndromic generalized photoreceptor dystrophies, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and Leber 
congenital amaurosis. The clinical investigations and genetic testing needed to establish a diagnosis are outlined, 
and current management approaches are discussed, focusing on the importance of the involvement of an interdisci-
plinary team from diagnosis and initial care to long-term follow-up and support.
Results The effective management of IRDs requires a multidisciplinary, and ideally interdisciplinary, team of experts 
knowledgeable about IRDs, with experienced professionals from fields as diverse as ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry, 
psychology, neurology, genetics, orthoptics, developmental therapy, typhlology, occupational therapy, otolaryngol-
ogy, and orientation and mobility specialties. Accurate clinical diagnosis encompasses a range of objective and sub -
jective assessments as a prerequisite for the genetic testing essential in establishing an accurate diagnosis necessary 
for the effective management of IRDs, particularly in the era of gene therapies. Improvements in genome sequencing 
techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have greatly facilitated the complex process of determining IRD-
causing gene variants and establishing a molecular diagnosis. Genetic counseling is essential to help the individual 
and their family understand the condition, the potential risk for offspring, and the implications of a diagnosis on visual 
prognosis and treatment options. Psychological support for patients and caregivers is important at all stages of diag-
nosis, care, and rehabilitation and is an essential part of the multidisciplinary approach to managing IRDs. Effective 
communication throughout is essential, and the patient and caregivers’ needs and expectations must be acknowl-
edged and discussed.

Introduction
Non-syndromic inherited retinal dystrophies (inherited 
retinal diseases; IRDs) form a large family of rare diseases 
characterized by the progressive dysfunction and loss of 
photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 
leading to severe impairment of vision or blindness [1–4]. 
The patterns of inheritance can be autosomal recessive, 
autosomal dominant, X-linked, or even mitochondrial [2, 
5].
Two generalized photoreceptor dystrophies are more 
likely to be encountered by pediatricians and ophthal -
mologists in a routine clinical setting: retinitis pig -
mentosa (RP), the most common IRD [6], and Leber 
congenital amaurosis (LCA), which is one of the most 
severe forms [7]. The onset of these conditions is usually 
between early childhood and late adolescence [3, 8–10].
Due to disease heterogeneity and the overlap of mani -
festations among different IRDs, achieving a definite 
clinical diagnosis is often difficult and requires a multi -
disciplinary effort combining several different assessment 
techniques [7, 11]. Determining IRD-causing gene vari -
ants has also proven complex. However, recent improve -
ments in genome sequencing techniques (notably, the 
introduction of next-generation sequencing, NGS) have 
considerably advanced the molecular diagnosis of IRDs 
[10, 12, 13]. Consequently, establishing the genotype of 
IRDs is increasingly considered an essential component 
of the diagnostic workup [8]. The approval in 2017 of 
voretigene neparvovec, a gene therapy indicated for the 
treatment of adult and pediatric patients with “vision loss 
due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed 
biallelic RPE65 mutations” [14, 15], has raised great 
expectations and provided further support for the need 
for molecular diagnosis [12, 16, 17].
The field of IRDs is rapidly evolving, as other gene ther -
apies are under development [1, 18]. These changes pose 
new challenges to clinicians treating patients with IRDs, 
including pediatricians, child neuropsychiatrists, and 
general ophthalmologists. It has become apparent that 
best-practice care for patients necessitates the involve -
ment of a broad multidisciplinary team experienced in 
the management of IRDs and including specialists in 
retinal diseases, the genetics of hereditary retinal dystro -
phies, vitreoretinal surgery, molecular biology, genetic 
counseling, patient support, and other technical and bioinformatic aspects of IRDs. In fact, the ideal approach 
should go beyond the multidisciplinary approach, in 
which team members work independently on a common 
issue within defined role responsibilities, to an interdisci -
plinary one, where teams made up of various disciplines 
work collaboratively towards a shared, patient-centered 
outcome, with each discipline building on the expertise 
of the others.
This narrative review aims to provides a clinical over -
view of the non-syndromic generalized photorecep -
tor dystrophies, in particular RP and LCA. The clinical 
investigations and genetic testing needed to establish a 
confirmed diagnosis will be outlined, and current man -
agement approaches will be discussed, focusing on the 
importance of the involvement of an interdisciplinary 
team from diagnosis and initial care through to long-
term follow-up and support.
Clinical overview
Retinitis pigmentosa and LCA are the two IRDs more 
commonly encountered in clinical practice. Accurate 
clinical diagnosis of RP and LCA, as with other IRDs, 
remains a key step in determining the etiopathogenesis of 
IRDs and effectively managing these conditions. IRDs are 
highly heterogeneous in phenotypes and genotypes [2, 
19–21], and their diagnosis is complicated by the diver -
sity of clinical presentations caused by mutations in a sin -
gle gene or overlapping clinical phenotypes that can be 
associated with mutations in different causative genes. 
Therefore, it is recommended that the clinical diagnosis 
is refined as much as possible using multiple assessment 
tools. Patients and parents will have expectations that 
a definitive diagnosis will be established and accurate 
information offered on prognosis, risk of genetic trans -
mission within the family, eligibility for treatment, or 
admission to ongoing clinical trials.
Retinitis pigmentosa
Retinitis pigmentosa is the most common IRD, with a 
worldwide prevalence of approximately 1:4000 [6, 22]. 
The term describes a heterogeneous group of progressive 
retinal dystrophies characterized by a primary degenera -
tion of rod photoreceptors that progresses to the loss of 
cone photoreceptors. Often a loss of night vision will Page 3 of 13
 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
 
be the first symptom the patient notices, followed by 
progressive concentric reduction of the visual field, ulti -
mately resulting in central vision loss. However, there 
is usually relative preservation of macula function until 
an advanced stage of the disease [6, 23]. The majority 
of forms of RP are associated with mutations of a single 
gene and display autosomal dominant, autosomal reces -
sive, X-linked or, more rarely, mitochondrial patterns of 
inheritance [5, 6]. Patients with X-linked RP , represent -
ing between 5 and 15% of patients with RP , tend to have 
a more severe disease course than those with autosomal 
recessive RP (50–60% of RP patients) [6]. The remain -
ing 30–40% of RP patients have an autosomal dominant 
form, which is associated with a better outcome in terms 
of retaining central vision [6].
Although the rhodopsin (RHO ) gene was the first gene 
implicated in autosomal RP , the involvement of muta -
tions in over 100 genes has since been identified [24], 
and genetic overlap with other IRDs further complicates 
the classification of RP [6]. The high number of genetic 
mutations associated with RP accounts for the wide 
heterogeneity exhibited by patients with the disease, 
with additional implicated genes progressively added 
as research into RP continues. However, RHO  remains 
the gene most associated with autosomal dominant 
RP , accounting for more than 30% of cases, followed by 
PRPH2 , PRPF31 , and RP1 [6].
Fundus abnormalities usually affect both eyes and are 
symmetrical; they typically show bone spicule pigmen -
tation, occurring mainly in the periphery (and/or mid-
periphery), narrowing of the retinal vessels, and a waxy 
optic nerve head pallor. These signs are hallmarks of the 
condition [6, 25]. During the early stages of RP , when 
bone spicule pigment deposition is absent or sparse, 
vascular attenuation is minimal, and the appearance of 
the optic disc is normal, the fundus may appear normal 
on examination. Additionally, before the appearance of 
the typical abnormalities of RP , nonspecific abnormali -
ties such as vitreous changes (cellophane aspect due to 
increased reflexes from the internal limiting membrane, 
broadening of the foveal reflex, vitreous condensation), 
and small, discrete, pale-colored local lesions may be 
present at the level of the RPE in some patients. Further -
more, the bone spicules at the fundus typical of RP do 
not develop in all patients, and the degree of hyperpig -
mentation can vary among patients. Macular complica -
tions may develop in RP , including epiretinal membrane 
formation, macular hole, and cystoid macular edema 
(CME), reported in up to 50% of patients [26].
The progression of RP is undertaken using visual 
field analysis, visual acuity, fundus autofluorescence 
(FAF) photography, and optical coherence tomography 
(OCT). Multimodal imaging is increasingly being used to monitor the progression and severity of the disease. Sev -
eral potential biomarkers have been identified, including 
the width of the ellipsoid zone retinal thinning on OCT 
or the diameter of the perifoveal hyperautofluorescent 
ring [27–30].
Leber congenital amaurosis
Leber congenital amaurosis represents the most severe 
form of IRD in infancy. It is typically characterized by 
an early onset within the first months of life and from as 
early as six weeks after birth with a profound visual def -
icit, absence of fixation, and a range of other signs and 
symptoms, including photophobia, nyctalopia, nystag -
mus, roving eye movements, and the oculodigital sign, 
together with a highly variable appearance of the fundus 
[7, 31, 32]. A milder form, namely early-onset severe reti -
nal dystrophy/severe early childhood onset retinal dys -
trophy (EOSRD/SECORD), usually presents after infancy 
and within the first five years of age, with a less severe 
impact on visual acuity and relatively more preserved full 
field electroretinogram (ffERG) responses according to 
different genotype–phenotype correlations [32]. Nota -
bly, despite a significant overlap of causative genes for the 
two phenotypes, mutations in some genes like GUCY2D, 
AIPL1, and CEP290 are more frequently associated with 
LCA, whereas others such as RPE65, LR AT,  and RDH12 
are commonly associated with EOSRD [33]. The ethnic 
background of patients may influence the frequency of 
mutations, with mutations in CEP290, GUCY2D, and 
RPE65 showing a prevalence of approximately 10% or 
higher, generally more frequent in Caucasian populations 
[33–35]. Conversely, CRB1 mutations, associated with 
13.6% of LCA cases, have been reported as the leading 
causative genetic defect in the Chinese population, fol -
lowed by mutations in GUCY2D [36]. LCA represents 
approximately 5% of all IRDs, with a prevalence ranging 
from 1/30,000 to 1/81,000 [7].
The most common refractive error is hyperopia, par -
ticularly when associated with mutations in GUCY2D; 
high myopia has also been reported suggesting an 
impaired process of emmetropization [31]. Associated 
ocular features are keratoconus and juvenile cataracts 
[7]. Gene mutation-dependent renal and olfactory dys -
function have also been reported [31]. Fundus appear -
ance presents high variability ranging from normal to 
severely disrupted retinal architecture that may include 
peripheral pigmentary retinopathy or macular atrophy 
[7]. Electrophysiological tests may be key in assessing 
patients with suspected LCA presenting nystagmus and 
apparent normal fundus early in life; ffERG responses 
are usually undetectable or severely reduced, although 
a residual cone response has been reported in GUCY2D 
mutation and a residual rod response in RPE65 [37]. Page 4 of 13 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
The improvements in retinal imaging technologies like 
spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) have revealed the spe -
cific retinal structural alterations associated with a par -
ticular genotype, allowing a better phenotype-genotype 
characterization.
In specific genetic mutations, such as GUCY2D, 
CEP290, and RPE65, the central foveal structure may be 
relatively preserved, which paves the way to potential 
therapeutic strategies for genetic remodeling. The identi -
fied genes account for about three-quarters of LCA cases, 
and recent data from the Retinal Information Network 
lists 26 genes associated with LCA [24]. The majority of 
causative mutations in LCA have an autosomal recessive 
pattern of inheritance (except for CRX , IMPDH1, and 
OTX2 ) and can affect all of the molecular mechanisms 
involved in vision: phototransduction (GUCY2D, AIPL1, 
RD3, KCNJ13), retinoid cycle (RPE65, LR AT  , RDH12), cil -
iary transportation (LCA5 , CEP290, RPGRIP1, SPATA7 , 
TULP1, IQCB1), photoreceptor morphogenesis (CRX , 
CRB1, GDF6, PRPH2 ), guanine synthesis (IMPDH1), and 
photoreceptor differentiation (OTX2 ) [37]. However, the 
underlying mechanism implicated in the LCA phenotype 
of the recently-identified mutations in USP45 (LCA 19) 
and other genes remains to be clarified [38].
Multidisciplinary care of patients with inherited 
retinal dystrophies
Overview
When a suspicion of an IRD is identified, the initial com -
prehensive neurological, ophthalmologic, and perception 
tests to identify the patient’s clinical profile will encom -
pass the development profile of the child together with 
the etiology of the visual disability, functional vision and 
also neuropsychiatric aspects such as cognition, learn -
ing, and socio-emotional aspects. The etiopathogenetic 
diagnosis of the visual deficit begins the evaluation of any 
associated neurological or systemic symptoms related to 
syndromic forms of retinal dystrophy and is a prerequi -
site for genetic testing.
An accurate determination of the patient’s visual func -
tion is critical, and objective and subjective measures 
are used in combination. The diagnostic process should 
involve an accurate medical history, with inquiries 
about the existence of other family members with visual 
impairment or systemic diseases (e.g., hearing loss, kid -
ney diseases); assessment of visual acuity; fundus exami -
nation; evaluation of the extent of vision loss via a visual 
field test (Goldmann visual field); evaluation of retinal 
activity using ffERG; retina assessment using imaging 
techniques, namely OCT and FAF [6, 11, 39]. Although 
ERG and Goldmann perimetry continue to be crucial 
functional tests, retina imaging with OCT and FAF have 
contributed significantly to our understanding of the retinal structure and degeneration and represent essen -
tial diagnostic tools. A newer tool, the full-field stimulus 
threshold (FST), an alternative test for assessing retinal 
function in patients where ERG is not able to be per -
formed or where ERG responses are undetectable, is also 
making its way into clinical practice as a valuable tool for 
further diagnostic investigations, such as the evaluation 
of treatment effects [40], and is now widely available in 
centers that manage IRDs [9].
An ongoing exchange between child neuropsychia -
trists, ophthalmologists, pediatricians, and geneticists is 
crucial to establish and better define the different steps 
of diagnosis jointly. Additional investigations such as 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroen -
cephalogram (EEG), metabolic examinations, abdomen 
ultrasound, in particular in the presence of neurological 
and systemic associated symptoms, and genetic analysis 
may also be considered in order to differentiate non-syn -
dromic from syndromic forms, such as ciliopathies (e.g., 
Joubert’s syndrome) [41–43], and peroxisomal and mito -
chondrial diseases [44, 45]. Neurological symptoms such 
as hypotonia, neuromotor deficit, ataxia, epilepsy, and 
auditory, skeletal, renal and hepatic abnormalities can be 
further evaluated to confirm a diagnosis.
Clinical investigations
(a) Perimetry
In the early stages of IRD photopic visual field may 
appear complete. However, small relative scotomata may 
be located in the region between 20° and 40° from the fix -
ation point and will fuse progressively, with the appear -
ance of a relatively dense annular scotoma in the area 
between 20° to 45° from the fixation point [25]. During 
the course of the disease, the annular scotoma extends 
toward both the center and the periphery. Eventually, 
tunnel vision will develop, with a central field between 
5° and 10° around the fixation point. Kinetic perimetry is 
most suitable for the assessment of peripheral visual field 
loss.
(b) Electroretinography
The ERG technique measures the electrical activity of 
retinal photoreceptor cells and provides information on 
the activity of rod and cone cells in response to light. 
Decreased electrical activity indicates a loss of photore -
ceptor function.
The use of ffERG for adults and, when necessary, 
using abbreviated protocols in children, represents a 
fundamental tool for diagnosing IRDs supported by 
the guidelines of the International Society for Clinical Page 5 of 13
 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
 
Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) (http:// www. iscev.  
org/ stand  ards). It reveals the characteristic loss of pho -
toreceptor function, which occurs principally among 
rod photoreceptors rather than cones in the early 
stages of the disease [6 ]. Indeed, by comparing the loss 
of rod- and cone-mediated responses, one can distin -
guish between a disease involving primary rod photo -
receptors and secondarily cones, like typical RP and 
congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), from a 
primary dysfunction and degeneration of both rods and 
cones, as in cone-rod dystrophies, and from a selective 
dysfunction/degeneration of cones with no or minimal 
involvement of rods, as in cone dystrophies, achro -
matopsia, and blue cone monochromatism.
ERG abnormalities precede occur in the early stages, 
preceding night blindness symptoms and fundus abnor -
malities in RP . An undetectable or at least severely 
reduced ERG recording is typical in LCA [6 , 31, 32]. 
ERG is also important for diagnosing atypical forms 
without pigments from congenital hemeralopia. As the 
disease progresses, ffERG may become non-record -
able despite a residual visual field, in which case FST 
provides a fast test while circumventing the fixation 
requirement. Alternatively, a multifocal ERG (mfERG) 
may still be able to elicit responses and help monitor 
disease progression. Delayed responses in the mfERG 
may predict visual field loss in a retina that otherwise 
appears to be healthy [6 ].
(c) Optical coherence tomography
Optical coherence tomography allows the visualization 
of the thinning or disappearance of retinal layers, includ -
ing the photoreceptor layer of the posterior pole. The use 
of OCT in IRDs has been well described, particularly in 
RP , where histopathological changes are first shown by 
a shortening of the photoreceptor outer segments [46], 
with confirmation seen on SD-OCT imaging, that shows 
disorganization of the outer retinal layers, first at the 
interdigitation zone, then the ellipsoid zone (EZ), and 
finally occurring at the external limiting membrane [47, 
48]. In particular, in sector RP , OCT shows the differ -
ences between the affected and non-affected retinal areas 
[49].
Disruption of the EZ zone is associated with a worse 
prognosis in RP . More specifically, the restoration of nor -
mal vision in terms of visual acuity can be expected in 
patients with an EZ width of approximately 600 μm [50]. 
As RP progresses, there is a thinning of the outer seg -
ments accompanied by a decrease in the thickness of the 
outer nuclear layer (ONL), the location of photorecep -
tor cell nuclei. In the late stages of RP , there is a complete 
loss of both the outer segment and the ONL [6, 51].In patients with RP , hyperreflective foci (HRF) are fre -
quently found in the outer layers of the central macula, at 
the edge of the atrophic outer retina, and in the choroid, 
associated with a decrease in macular thickness accom -
panied by visual impairment. The concomitant presence 
of HRF could lead to more profound visual impair -
ment and marked visual decline during monitoring [52]. 
OCT imaging also has a role in diagnosing other macu -
lar abnormalities, such as macular edema and atrophic 
changes, that are present in up to 50% of patients with RP 
[47, 48, 53].
Changes in superficial and deep vascular density and 
enlarged foveal avascular zone have been demonstrated 
with OCT angiography (OCT-A) [54], which also allows 
the study of the choroidal tissue, which it is not possible 
to evaluate accurately using other imaging techniques: 
choroidal thickness is significantly lower in the RP in 
comparison normal subjects [55].
In some LCA genotypes, OCT studies may ini -
tially show relatively normal outer retinal morphology, 
whereas normal or subnormal retinal and ONL thickness 
may be observed in other patients; viable photoreceptor 
the presence of viable photoreceptors appears to persist 
until relatively later in the disease process [31, 32].
(d) Fundus autofluorescence imaging
Fundus autofluorescence is an essential diagnostic tool 
for diagnosing and monitoring IRDs that can detect oth -
erwise-undetectable disruptions in RPE metabolism.
Lipofuscin in the RPE is the principal source of the 
autofluorescent signal using short-wavelength (SW)-FAF 
(blue or green light). Hyperautofluorescence is correlated 
with metabolic dysfunction of the retina, and hypoauto -
fluorescence is correlated with atrophy of the RPE [56–
58] (Fig.  1). An abnormal foveal ring or curvilinear arc of 
increased autofluorescence not visible on ophthalmos -
copy is present in 50–60% of RP patients [48, 57]. Such an 
hyperautofluorescent ring can represent a transition zone 
between normal and abnormal retinal function, with 
relatively normal function within the ring and absent 
function outside it. More specifically, the hyperautofluo -
rescent ring denotes an area of outer segment dysgenesis 
and lipofuscin production, with progressive retinal thin -
ning usually associated with loss of the ellipsoid zone at 
(or close to) the inner edge of the ring [58] (Fig.  2). The 
diameter of the ring grows smaller over time, in paral -
lel with the reduction of the visual field [6, 48]. Recently, 
ultra-wide field (UWF) imaging allowed the evaluation 
of the FAF abnormalities of the retinal periphery and 
revealed that the hypoautofluorescent areas at the FAF 
examination co-localize with the visual field scotomata 
seen on Goldmann perimetry in patients with RP [59, Page 6 of 13 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
60]. Other autofluorescence patterns, such as central 
hyperautofluorescence, triple hyperautofluorescent rings 
and paravascular hyperautofluorescent alterations, can 
be observed in addition to the hyperfluorescent ring [57, 
60, 61]. Certain retinal degenerations may also exhibit an 
overall low FAF signal due to an enzymatic dysfunction 
of the visual cycle, such as RPE65 Leber congenital amau -
rosis and fundus albipunctatus [58, 6258, 62].
Molecular diagnosis
The goal of genetic testing is to achieve a molecular 
diagnosis that allows a proper genotype–phenotype 
correlation while confirming the clinical diagnosis and 
distinguishing the IRD from other forms of retinal dis -
ease. In addition to providing a more accurate progno -
sis of the likely visual outcome, an accurate molecular 
diagnosis facilitates developing appropriate follow-up 
and rehabilitation, establishing eligibility for available 
gene therapies, and estimating recurrence risk for future 
offspring and other family members [2, 3, 8, 9]. The 
proband’s parents should also be included in genetic test -
ing when available. A molecular diagnosis also represents 
the basis for planning effective genetic counseling for 
affected families.Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques, such 
as targeted multi-gene NGS sequencing using large gene 
panels, have greatly aided and simplified molecular diag -
nosis. However, the considerable variability and overlap 
of disease presentation in patients with IRDs still pre -
sent challenges in achieving an accurate molecular diag -
nosis. Genetic laboratories must maintain the high level 
of competence essential to provide accurate genotypic 
characterization.
Since its introduction, NGS-based genetic testing has 
revolutionized the diagnosis of IRDs by facilitating the 
identification of causative genes responsible for the dis -
eases [10, 12, 13, 16]. It is now possible to identify the 
pathogenic variants in up to 70%, or even more, of cases. 
As of October 2022, over 280 genes causing IRD had 
been identified [24]. The identified genes often encode 
key molecules of retinal phototransduction and the visual 
cycle.
In the past years, a problem in identifying emerging 
pathogenic variants was the lack of consensus between 
laboratories. It was estimated that laboratories disa -
greed in interpreting a variant in 17% of cases [63]. To 
overcome this problem, guidelines for interpreting 
sequence variants issued by the American College of

Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association of 
Molecular Pathology [64] provide criteria for the inter -
pretation of the variant pathogenicity (for example, allele 
frequency > 5%, in general, suggests benignity) [64]. How -
ever, some exceptions exist (for example, mild ABCA4 
variants with higher allele frequency values have been 
identified in Stargardt disease) [65]. Several computa -
tional predictive programs have been developed to aid in 
interpreting sequence variants [64, 66, 67]. They provide 
algorithms that help to determine the effect of a sequence 
variant at the nucleotide and amino acid level, allow -
ing the effect of the genetic variant on the primary and 
alternative gene transcripts to be determined, along with 
other genomic elements, including information on the 
potential impact of the variant on the protein function.
Variants that fail to meet the criteria for interpretation 
are classified as “of uncertain significance” (VUS) [66]. 
The resolution of VUS cases requires segregation analy -
sis and collaboration between centers. Crosschecking information gathered from genetic testing across dif -
ferent databases (Human Genome Mutation Database, 
gnomAD, VarSome) is highly recommended. Variant 
classification is dynamic, and classified variants need 
periodic re-evaluation [68, 69].
There remain limitations and unresolved issues relating 
to genetic testing for IRDs. For about 30–40% of patients 
with an IRD, the genetic cause remains unclear [70]. The 
reasons for cases of genetically unsolved IRD include 
the presence of mutations undetectable/uninterpret -
able by NGS. For example, highly repetitive sequences 
that require a dedicated Sanger approach, deep intronic 
sequences that affect splicing mechanisms, small dele -
tions/duplications that in some cases can also have an 
impact on topological-associated domains in the genome, 
VUS, unexpected phenotype-genotype correlations, and 
novel IRD genes [8, 12, 71]. The interpretation of VUS 
is challenging [72, 73] and will continue to be refined 
through further research.
Genetic counseling
Genetic counseling allows the individual and families to 
understand the condition and the potential risk for off -
spring, aids informed reproductive decisions and helps 
explain the implications of the diagnosis on visual prog -
nosis and treatment options. While counseling after 
genetic testing is essential to explain and interpret the 
results obtained, patients and their families should also 
receive counseling before testing so that the advantages 
and potential disadvantages of a genetic test are under -
stood in advance. Ideally, counseling by at least a medical 
geneticist with in-depth knowledge of the genetic aspects 
of IRDs, supported where possible by a genetic counse -
lor, forms an effective two-way communication process 
that helps those involved to understand the information, 
make appropriate choices about the course of action that 
needs to be followed and facilitates coming to terms with 
the condition.
As patients’ expectations and patient-reported out -
comes are increasingly being considered in clinical trial 
design in rare diseases [74, 75], it is important to inform 
patients clearly, understand their expectations, and be 
available for and ready to answer their questions [74, 76]. 
A genetic test usually raises many questions in the minds 
of a child’s parents. Without creating unrealistic expecta -
tions, it should be explained that the genetic test is part 
of the therapeutic process and may reveal the eligibility 
for available and/or future treatments. The time taken 
to provide effective genetic counseling is rewarded by a 
greater sense of control over the condition for the patient 
and their family.

Disease management
The multidisciplinary (or interdisciplinary) approach is 
based on the biopsychosocial model (Fig.  3), which uses 
biological, psychological, and sociological factors and 
their complex interrelationships to understand the psy -
chophysical health of the patient and guide the choice 
of therapeutic intervention [77, 78]. It provides a uni -
tary and global approach to the person and represents a 
good platform for an interdisciplinary approach between 
the various professions involved. IRDs require such an 
approach from the developmental age and throughout 
youth and young adulthood. The professionals involved 
may differ at different stages of the subject’s age, and not 
all participate at the same time in the process of care. In 
reality, IRDs are chronic conditions in which the needs 
of the person, family members, and caregivers change 
across the different phases of life and with the progres -
sion of the disease. Caregiving of individuals with IRDs 
is long-term and needed for the person’s entire lifetime.
The individual must be placed at the center of an ideal 
circle around which the various professionals revolve 
(Fig.  4) while, at the same time, the person participates in 
their own course of treatment. It is important that emo -
tional support is provided to the child and caregivers at 
diagnosis and that a coordinated approach is followed to 
guide the family through all stages of care and habilita -
tion or rehabilitation and to facilitate the registration 
process. This is designed to ensure appropriate benefits 
and support are issued. In Italy, this role may be per -
formed by genetic counselors and low vision specialists, although specific Eye Clinic Liaison Officers may form 
part of the multidisciplinary team in some countries.
This is person-centered care, a method of approach -
ing illness and treatment recommended by the World 
Health Organization [79], which sees health as an inter -
play of physical, mental, and social well-being and not 
merely the absence of disease or infirmity. This concept 
of health correlates closely with perceived quality of 
life. In all chronic conditions, the goal of treatment is to 
contain the damage, slow, if possible, the progression of 
the disease, and improve the person’s well-being.
Caring for children with IRDs demands close col -
laboration among an interdisciplinary team that may 
include pediatricians, optometrists, ophthalmologists, 
orthoptists, low vision specialists, medical geneticists, 
child neuropsychiatrists, psychologists, developmental 
therapists, typhlologists, educators, occupational thera -
pists, orientation and mobility specialists, habilitators 
(for the very young) and rehabilitators (for older chil -
dren). The professionals involved should have in-depth 
knowledge of the genetic aspects of IRDs and the man -
agement of vision disorders beyond their knowledge of 
syndromic disorders. This approach, recommended for 
diagnosis, follow-up, and rehabilitation management, is 
illustrated in Fig. 4 .
Particularly in the first years of life, the functional 
impact of vision impairment can manifest itself not 
only with visual clinical signs such as nystagmus, low 
vision, and abnormal behavior to light but also with 
clinical signs regarding development such as reduced 
emotional facial expression, motor initiative, and inter -
active proactivity, stereotypies, lack of interest for 
the environment. In older children, it is important to 
look also for behavioral problems, reading difficulties, 
reduced mobility, navigation difficulties (e.g., in dif -
ferent light conditions of the environment), a cautious 
attitude in orienting themselves in new spaces or inter -
acting with peers that could be related to the vision 
impairment.
Vision plays a key role in a child’s overall development. 
From this perspective, it is clear that congenital and/or 
early-onset visual disorders could jeopardize the struc -
turing of crucial functions: communicative-relational 
(from the very earliest stages of the mother–child bond -
ing process), cognitive-neuropsychological, motor (pos -
tural control, action) [80] and spatial. The development 
of the visually-impaired child has peculiarities and signs 
of risk that are important to recognize in order to set up 
good management, and it is also very important to know 
not only how the eye functions but also how the person 
functions [81]. We need to consider tasks such as read -
ing, mobility, face recognition, social context, and qual -
ity of life. These reasons reinforce the need to involve B
Fig. 3 The biopsychosocial model provides a unitary and global 
approach to the person and represents a good platform 
for an interdisciplinary approach between the various professions 
involved in managing patients with inherited retinal diseasesPage 9 of 13

the kind of broadly-skilled multidisciplinary or interdis -
ciplinary team outlined above, starting at diagnosis and 
continuing throughout the habilitation and rehabilitation 
phases.
Rehabilitation or habilitation, as appropriate according 
to developmental age, often begins from the time of diag -
nosis, and caring also extends to the entire family from 
this time. Ideally, the intervention will be: (a) interdisci -
plinary; (b) multisensory, with activities that encourage the integration of different perceptual information com -
ing from the environment; (c) individualized, that is 
based on the visual and developmental profile of the child 
and his overall clinical picture; (d) multidimensional, 
because its rehabilitation goals rely on collaboration 
between professionals and caregivers across the differ -
ent contexts of life and the entailing activities also related 
to home, school and social settings [82]. Two broad cat -
egories of intervention can be considered in determining Fig. 4 The patient-centered multidisciplinary team approach to vision rehabilitation in visually impaired children and young/young-adult persons 
with inherited retinal dystrophies. The green circles identify the professionals dedicated exclusively to the subject in the developmental agePage 10 of 13 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
rehabilitation objectives; those targeting the develop -
ment of visual and alternative sensory skills (e.g., touch, 
hearing) and their functional use and those designed to 
prevent or reduce a possible negative impact of the visual 
impairment on overall development [82]. Visual support, 
such as low vision aids, computer screen readers, audio -
books, and tablet computer-based assistive technologies 
such as optical character recognition, screen magnifiers, 
or text-to-speech conversion, can help children compen -
sate for diminishing visual function [82].
Parents are offered psychological support to assist 
their adjustment to and coping with the diagnosis while 
sustaining the parent child-relationship and promoting 
understanding of the child’s needs and means of expres -
sion. As the patient grows, psychological care is planned 
for them, either individually or in groups. Ultimately, 
such an intervention aims to encourage independence in 
the child and improve the quality of life, social participa -
tion, and integration.
In the young, young-adult subject, unlike the typical 
management of developmental age, it is possible to iden -
tify two multidisciplinary teams that intervene at differ -
ent times: the “diagnostic team” and the “rehabilitation or 
habilitation team” . The “diagnostic team” consists of the 
ophthalmologist, the medical geneticist, and the psychol -
ogist (Fig.  4). Where present in the team, the psychologist 
is a fundamental figure in supporting communication at 
the diagnosis and ensuring individual support is available 
if necessary [83].
Later, ocular disease progression requires starting with 
vision rehabilitation [84]. In this phase of the treatment 
process, the team consists of the ophthalmologist, the 
psychologist, the orthoptist, the orientation and mobility 
and personal autonomy instructor, the typhlologist, and 
the computer scientist.
The habilitation or rehabilitation project is timed and 
individualized to the individual’s needs, requests, and 
clinical condition [85], considering the patient’s emo -
tional state and readiness to deal with the demands of the 
rehabilitation process. As a key team member, the psy -
chologist supports not only the person, family members, 
and caregivers, but provides emotional support to other 
team members to minimize potential burnout.
The overall objective of vision rehabilitation is to assist 
the subject to find the best strategies to take advantage 
of their residual vision, promoting the integration of the 
“new self” , which translates into an improvement in per -
ceived well-being and quality of life.Summary
• The effective management of inherited retinal dys -
trophies (IRDs) requires close collaboration between 
members of a multidisciplinary, or ideally an interdis -
ciplinary, team of experts knowledgeable about IRDs, 
including suitably experienced professionals from the 
fields of ophthalmology, neuropsychiatry, psychol -
ogy, neurology, genetics, orthoptics, developmental 
therapy, typhlology, occupational therapy, otolaryn -
gology, and/ orientation and mobility specialties.
• As IRDs usually present at an early age, clinicians 
need to be aware of the clinical signs suggesting vis -
ual impairment and follow up with timely diagnoses 
to facilitate appropriate therapeutic or rehabilitation 
interventions to minimize vision loss.
• The highly heterogeneous nature and overlapping of 
manifestations among the different IRDs make reach -
ing a definitive diagnosis difficult. Accurate clini -
cal diagnosis is a prerequisite for genetic testing and 
requires a range of objective and subjective assess -
ment measures to ensure appropriate treatment and 
optimization of outcomes.
• The diagnostic process should involve taking an 
accurate medical history, consideration of family his -
tory, fundus examination, evaluation of visual acuity, 
the extent of vision loss via a visual field test (Gold -
mann visual field), retinal activity (full-field electro -
retinogram), and retina assessment using imaging 
using optical coherence tomography and fundus 
autofluorescence. Full-field light sensitivity testing is 
also a valuable tool for further diagnostic investiga -
tion.
• Establishing the genotype of IRDs is increasingly 
considered essential in the diagnostic workup, par -
ticularly since the introduction of voretigene nepar -
vovec as an effective gene therapy for treating adult 
and pediatric patients with vision loss due to IRDs 
caused by confirmed biallelic mutations in the RPE65 
gene.
• The complex process of determining IRD-causing 
gene variants to reach a molecular diagnosis takes 
advantage of improvements in genome sequencing 
techniques, notably next-generation sequencing.
• Patients and their families must receive counseling 
before and after genetic testing; effective communi -
cation is essential, and patient and parents’ expecta -
tions must be acknowledged and discussed.
• Psychological support for patients and caregivers is 
important at all stages of diagnosis, care, and reha -
bilitation, and the child neuropsychiatrist plays an 
essential role in managing IRDs.Page 11 of 13
 Murro et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2023) 18:223 
 
• Comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans for 
patients with IRD have been developed to provide 
streamlined and patient-friendly access to clinical 
and molecular diagnoses, accelerate access to avail -
able therapeutic options and support, and for referral 
to standardized clinical care and rehabilitation.
• Despite the solid collective effort in the field of 
advanced diagnosis and novel therapies for IRDs, fur -
ther knowledge is required about the natural history 
of the diseases that could be helpful to better evalu -
ate treatment effects, particularly in these slowly 
progressive diseases. Given the rarity of each form 
of IRD, this usually needs the development of multi -
centric studies designed with appropriate and robust 
protocols.
Conclusions
Timely and accurate diagnosis and appropriate inter -
disciplinary management involving ophthalmologists, 
geneticists, and other medical specialists have important 
implications for the overall development and life-long 
visual function and quality of life of children with IRDs.
