Retinitis pigmentosa is one of the major forms of inherited retinal dystrophy transmitted in
all Mendelian and non-Mendelian forms of inheritance. It involves the loss of retinalphotoreceptor cells with severe loss of vision or blindness within the ﬁrst 2 decades of
life. RP occurs at a relatively high prevalence in India and is often associated with
consanguinity in certain South Asian communities where this practice is customary.
This review describes the studies that have been published with regard to genetics ofretinitis pigmentosa in India and neighboring South Asian countries. These populationshave been understudied in these aspects although to a variable degree from one country toanother. Genetic studies on RP in India have been carried out with a range of methodsaimed at detecting speci ﬁc mutations, to screening of candidate genes or selected
genomic regions, homozygosity mapping to whole genome sequencing. These effortshave led to a molecular genetic characterization of RP in Indian families. Similar studies onlarge extended families from Pakistan have provided insight into several novel genesunderlying the pathogenesis of these diseases. The extreme degree of clinical and geneticheterogeneity of RP renders it challenging to identify the associated genes in thesepopulations, and to translate the research output towards better management of thedisease, as there are no unifying genetic features that are characteristic of any populationso far.

1 BACKGROUND
Inherited retinal diseases are a large, heterogeneous group of disorders that are grouped according to
the retinal layers primarily affected, whether syndromic or non-syndromic, and by the mode ofinheritance. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary retinal disorder leading to severe visualimpairment or blindness in the ﬁrst 2 decades of life. RP involves the death of photoreceptor cells, a
process that occurs progressively with loss of both rods and cones. Though classi ﬁed as a rod-cone
type of disease with primary loss of rods, the pattern of disease may involve loss of cones in early
stages of the disease as well, in addition to loss of rods. Typically, it manifests with night blindness,loss of visual acuity, loss of visual ﬁelds which progressively leads to “tunnel vision. ”The
electroretinographic responses of the photoreceptors are extinguished. It is clinically veryheterogeneous in its manifestation.
This review deals with genetics of RP and related diseases in South Asian populations, with
particular reference to India, but also highlights studies in this topic from Pakistan, Nepal andBangladesh. These countries are not equally represented in the literature in the ﬁeld of retinal
dystrophies. Among the countries mentioned, there are a much larger number of studies on familiesEdited by:

disease-associated genes in several Pakistani families, byconventional techniques of mapping and sequencing, and
more recently, by next generation sequencing (NGS). For its
geographic area and population, Pakistan is not underrepresentedin studies of RP, despite the higher prevalence of RP and relatedretinal diseases as compared to Western countries. Theavailability and recruitment of extended, large families residingin the same town or village has conceivably facilitated geneticstudies for the identi ﬁcation of novel genes. The relative
proportion of published literature on the genetics of RP fromthis region, suggests that there are about twice as manypublications on Pakistani families with RP as compared toIndia ( Zafar et al., 2017 ).
A discussion on the genetics and other related aspects of RP in
Indian populations is provided here ( Table 1 ) as well as
representative genetic studies from the Pakistani population(Table 2 ). Literature in this subject is very scarce from the
other countries in South Asia.
2 PREVALENCE OF RETINITIS
PIGMENTOSA
The prevalence of RP and related diseases has been determined in
population-based studies in different regions of India. In the stateof Andhra Pradesh in Southern India, a study on the frequencyand causes of blindness found the prevalence of RP to be about 1in 1,000 population, (0.1%) in both rural and urban areascombined. Blindness due to RP accounted for almost half ofall blindness due to retinal diseases ( Dandona et al., 2001 ).
Population-based studies from other states in India providesimilar frequencies for RP, with about 0.17% prevalence in thestate of Tamil Nadu in Southern India ( Sen et al., 2008 ) and 0.13%
in a population from Central India ( Nangia et al., 2012 ). A
hospital-based study across a L. V. Prasad Eye Institute(LVPEI) network of hospitals representing primary to tertiaryeye care across Southern and Eastern India, reported a prevalenceof about 0.59% for RP ( Parameswarappa et al., 2021 ). The higher
frequency of RP in this report may be relevant to an eye careinstitutional framework which included all patients with eye
diseases reporting to the hospitals in the network. Among themodes of inheritance of the disease, the occurrence of familial
disease as reported varies widely between studies, possibly due to
a difference in the sizes of study populations analyzed. Theprevalence of familial disease is about 0.1 (10%) based on astudy of over 15,000 patients with RP presenting over a 6-yearperiod ( Parameswarappa et al., 2021 ). In contrast, a study of
seventy-eight cases covering a 6-month period, suggested theoccurrence of a familial pattern (including all modes of autosomaland X-linked inheritance) in about half of the patients. Isolatecases (patients with no family history of the disease) representclose to one-half of RP patients encountered in this setting ( Kar
et al., 1995 ).
Consanguinity is a social factor that is often associated with
recessive disease, and has been suggested to be correlated to thehigher occurrence of RP in Southern India, due to the commoncustom of consanguineous marriages in this region ( Nirmalan
et al., 2006 ). Consanguinity between two spouses increases the
chances of an offspring to inherit the same disease gene from eachof the parents and thereby develop recessive disease. In suchfamilies, both parents are carriers of a common disease gene thatis passed down from a single ancestor. Thus, the offspring isautozygous at the disease locus ( Lander and Botstein, 1987 ). This
phenomenon of autozygosity or homozygosity by descent (HBD)
applies not just to the disease locus, but extends to a fraction of
the entire genome. The probability that a particular genomicregion or gene is autozygous in an individual is also known as theco-efﬁcient of inbreeding (F). The value of F is 1/16 for marriage
between ﬁrst cousins, 1/8 for uncle and niece. Thus, the length of
the genome ﬂanking the disease gene that is autozygous in the
affected offspring varies depending on the extent of relatedness ofthe two parents. Despite the existence of autozygosity, theassociation between consanguinity and recessive disease in RPmay be tenuous particularly due to the low prevalence of RP itself,as well as the frequent rate of consanguinity in the South Asian
populations mentioned here. In addition, the relationship
between the prevalence of RP and consanguinity was foundonly in the case of a particular form of consanguinity- ﬁrst
cousin marriages.TABLE 1 | Major methods employed in genetic studies on Retinal Dystrophies in India.

Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 858556 2Kannabiran et al. Inherited Retinal Diseases in Understudied Populations3 CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF RETINITIS
PIGMENTOSA
The most common inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) seen at L.
V. Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), a tertiary care referral centernetwork in Southern India, are retinitis pigmentosa, LCA,juvenile retinoschisis, achromatopsia, Stargardt ’s disease and
Best disease. In all forms of retinal dystrophy, a predominanceof males was observed among patients presenting to the clinic.About one-third of patients with RP belonged to lower socio-economic strata. A history of consanguineous marriage wasfound in every sixth patient with a positive family history ofthe disease. A majority of patients presented in the clinic in the
third decade of life with severe impairment in visual acuity.
Defective night vision was a predominant clinical symptom atpresentation. Other symptoms found at presentation include,reduction in peripheral and central vision, color visionabnormalities and delayed dark adaptation. The retinalfeatures noted at presentation in this population include discpallor (76.43% of cases), attenuated arterioles (82.61% of cases),and bone spicule pigmentation (90.15% of cases). Almost allpatients were found to have retinal pigment epithelial changes(Parameswarappa et al., 2021 ).
The common syndromes associated with RP in this patient
population are Usher Syndrome followed by Lawrence Moon
Bardet Biedl Syndrome. Patients with Usher syndrome (USH)Type 1 and type 2 are more common than type 3 and present inthe 1st to 2nd decades of life. Defective night vision is the majormanifestation at initial visit in all three types of Usher syndrome.It is important to rule out Usher syndrome in early onset RP withhearing abnormalities. Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl (LMBB)syndrome is the second most common syndromic form of RP.Patients present in 1st –2nd decade of life with severe visual acuity
impairment (20/200 to 20/400) to blindness ( <20/400) early in
life. Severe reduction in central visual acuity is due to early
macular involvement and optic atrophy. Myopia is thepredominant refractive error and nuclear cataract is the
common form of cataract seen in LMBB with RP. Aprominent retinal feature is a diffuse or widespread retinalpigment epithelial degeneration in all patients. Patients withfeatures of early onset RP and impairment in central visualacuity need to be evaluated for LMBB syndrome. Early visual
as well as systemic rehabilitation is crucial along with supportive
therapy upon detection of LMBB syndrome. Though patientswith IRD in India currently do not have access to speci ﬁc visual
implants or gene therapy, surgical intervention for associatedproblems like cataract, capsular phimosis, angle closureglaucoma, retinal detachment, macular pathology etc., may berequired. All IRD patients need comprehensive low visionassessment and rehabilitation.
Diagnostic and management challenges in a clinical set up in
India with respect to RP and other IRDs are variable clinicalpresentation, lack of diagnostic and imaging tools in all hospitals,
difﬁculty in examining all the family members, lack of uniform
guidelines for genetic counselling and the high cost of genetictesting. Even where testing is available, there are gaps in genetictesting or counselling for all patients due to lack of patientawareness, acceptance, and accessibility of the services.
4 GENETICS OF RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA
AND RELATED DISORDERS IN INDIA
Molecular genetic investigations of patients and families with RP
have employed a variety of methods, and these have evolved overtime, in parallel with advances in the ﬁeld of human genetics and
genomics. Figure 1 shows a timeline of major developments in
this area. The methods range from selective analysis of chosenmutations, screening of candidate genes to genome-wideapproaches including mapping and exome sequencing. Themethods used in various studies are summarized in Table 1 .
For example, allele-speci ﬁc assays were used for the detection ofTABLE 2 | Summary of Major Genetic Studies on RP and related diseases in Pakistani families.

Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 858556 3Kannabiran et al. Inherited Retinal Diseases in Understudied Populationscommon mutations in the rhodopsin ( RHO ) gene. These include
changes at codon 345 (Val345Met and Val345leu) and codon 347(Pro347Ser/Ala/Arg/Gln/Thr); screening of a series of aboutsixty-nine probands consisting of dominant, recessive,
X-linked and sporadic RP, showed the codon 345 mutation in
two probands. None of the patients tested had codon 347mutations ( Dikshit and Agarwal, 2001 ). Allele-speci ﬁc assays
have also been employed in a multiplexed mode for screeningknown mutations in RP genes. Thus, a missense change in RPE65
(Tyr368His) was detected in one out of thirty-eight patients in ascreening approach that included 103 mutations by an allele-speciﬁc ligation method ( Sundaresan et al., 2009 ). Direct
sequencing of candidate genes in series of unrelated RPpatients, particularly those with ADRP and isolate RP, hasrevealed mutations in rhodopsin, pre-mRNA splicing factor 31
(PRPF31 ), retinitis pigmentosa 1 ( RP1) and inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 ( IMPDH1 ) genes. These
studies suggest a low frequency of mutations in these genes, ofbelow 2% among the patients evaluated ( Gandra et al., 2008 ).
Whole genome mapping studies have been reported on
extended families with RP and related disorders. The RP28
locus was mapped by conventional linkage analysis in a four-generation consanguineous family with ARRP from Karnataka inSouthern India (seventeen members studied), to a region of about1 cM on chromosome 2p11-p15 ( Kumar et al., 2004 ). The age at
onset of disease in this family was in the ﬁrst-second decades of
life, with features fairly typical of RP. Another genome wide
linkage study mapped the disease on to chromosome 19q13.4 in afour-generation family with ADRP including eighteen membersanalyzed. A seven base pair deletion, leading to a predictedframeshift (p.Gly20AlafsX43), was identi ﬁed in the PRPF31
gene, which is present in the critical region. This family hadincomplete penetrance of the disease ( Saini et al., 2012 ). Clinical
features in relation to the appearance of the fundus in the familiesreported in the two above-mentioned studies include pallor of theoptic disk, attenuated retinal vasculature and bone spicule type of
pigmentary deposits. Another family from North India wasmapped to the same locus by linkage analysis at speci ﬁc
candidate gene loci ( Bhatia et al., 2018 ). Patients in this family
had a missense mutation of cysteine-299 to tyrosine (Cys299Tyr)
in the PRPF31 gene. Apart from the typical phenotypic features of
RP as noted above, incomplete penetrance of the disease wasagain observed here. This phenomenon is a distinguishing aspectin families with PRPF31 mutations ( Vithana et al., 2003 ).
A whole genome linkage study led to the mapping of ADRP to
chromosome 6q23, in a large four generation family from AndhraPradesh ( Kannabiran et al., 2012 ).
The analysis of autosomal recessive RP (ARRP) or other
retinal dystrophy in Indian families has frequently employedhomozygosity screening since the families studied are often
consanguineous. The approach involves the detection of regions
of homozygosity that are shared between affected offspring of aconsanguineous marriage. The principle of mapping recessivedisease genes in such inbred families relies on the presence ofhomozygosity by descent (HBD) in the genome of children ofconsanguineous parents ( Lander and Botstein, 1987 ).
Homozygosity mapping has been carried out with differenttypes of genetic markers such as microsatellite markers andSNPs, and candidate genes in the regions of homozygosity thusdetected, are screened for mutations. Often, a pedigree of afamily with recessive disease is not suitable for detecting linkage
due to its small size and limited number of affected offspring.
Screening for homozygosity in such cases relies on detectingshared regions of homozygosity (ROH) at known disease lociamong affected members of a family. More recently, the HBDprinciple has been applied to data from direct exomesequencing. In the latter technique, one looks at continuousstretches of shared homozygosity in the exome sequence ofaffected siblings to ﬁnd the pathogenic mutations –in other
words, it is an analysis of the autozygome.

Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 858556 4Kannabiran et al. Inherited Retinal Diseases in Understudied PopulationsScreening for HBD has led to successful identi ﬁcation of
mutations in a subset of families with ARRP. Mapping withlocus-speci ﬁc microsatellite markers at candidate gene loci led to
mutations being detectable in about 10% –15% of Indian families
screened by this method ( Singh et al., 2006 ;Singh et al., 2009 ).
The genes associated to the disease include ATP-binding cassettesubfamily A member 4 ( ABCA4 ), tubby-like protein 1 ( TULP1 ),
retinaldehyde binding protein 1 ( RLBP1 ), retinal pigment
epithelial 65 kDa protein ( RPE65 ) and retinitis pigmentosa 1
(RP1). Mutation in each gene listed here occurred in one family,
and included frameshift, nonsense and missense changes.Screening for HBD with SNP arrays followed by sequencing ofchosen genes, identi ﬁed mutations in three out of sixteen families
(one- ﬁfth of families being positive for mutations) ( Kannabiran
et al., 2012 ). The onset of disease in the aforementioned ARRP
families ( Singh et al., 2009 ;Kannabiran et al., 2012 ) was in the
1st–2nd decades of life. Common features of the disease included
arterial narrowing, disc pallor and diffuse degeneration of theRPE. Macular degeneration was present in some cases.Pigmentary deposits within the retina were not frequentlyobserved. Another study from Southern India screened twelvefamilies (eleven with LCA and one with ARRP) for homozygosityusing SNP arrays and detected mutations in eleven families(Srilekha et al., 2015 )- genes with pathogenic mutations in
these patients were Aryl Hydrocarbon Interacting Protein-Like1(AIPL1 ), Retinal Pigment Epithelial 65 kDa Protein gene
(RPE65 ), Guanylate Cyclase 2D ( GUCY2D ), Crumbs Homolog
1(CRB1 ), Retinol Dehydrogenase 12 ( RDH12 ), IQ Calmodulin-
binding Motif-containing Protein 1 ( IQCB1 ),Spermatogenesis
Associated Protein 7 ( SPATA7 ) and Mer-Tyrosine Kinase
(MERTK ).The associated phenotypes included typical changes
in the fundus such as pigmentary deposits, atrophic macula, discpallor and attenuated vasculature. A similar approach ofhomozygosity mapping with SNP arrays in threeconsanguineous families with different retinal dystrophiesincluding LCA, ARRP and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), wasused to identify regions of homozygosity in the patients. This
was followed by targeted NGS to identify the pathogenic changes
in each family ( Sundaramurthy et al., 2016 ). In this study,
mutations were detected based on their location within one ofthe regions of homozygosity (ROH). Mutations in the RDH12 ,
ABCA4 and Cadherin-Related Family Member 1 ( CHDR1 ) genes
were found in the three families. Due to the presence of severallarge regions of homozygosity in the affected offspring in eachfamily, the authors employed targeted NGS with a panel of 184genes associated with eye diseases, to identify the relevantmutations. A related approach is that of whole genomehomozygosity mapping in combination with exome
sequencing. With this method, the disease was mapped to
chromosome 14q31 in a large family, and whole exomesequencing showed a mutation in the tetratricopeptide repeatdomain 8 ( TTC8 ) gene in this locus ( Goyal et al., 2016 ). The
mutation was a missense change with substitution of glutamine-449 to histidine (p.Gln449His). Thus homozygosity mappinghelped in the detection of pathogenic changes from the exomesequence data since one can restrict the variants that are selectedto those present within the ROH.Direct sequencing of candidate genes is a common approach
employed for identifying mutations in all forms of RP. Inparticular, there are a large number of RP patients that arecategorized as “isolate ”or simplex RP. Candidate genes are
selected on the basis of their known association with the disease
in the same or other populations, or on their physiologic role and
relevance in the functioning of photoreceptors or RPE. Screening ofa chosen retinal disease gene has also been done on the basis of theassociated phenotype. An example is a study of a four-generationfamily with two affected individuals and eleven members. Here, theaffected members presented with clinical and electrophysiologicalﬁndings suggestive of Goldman Favre syndrome (GFS). The retinal
features suggestive of GFS included clumped pigment deposits inthe fundus, with exudation and vascular masses in the peripheralretina ( Manayath et al., 2014 ). Mutations in the NR2E3 gene are
known to be associated with GFS and clumped pigmentary retinal
degeneration; analysis of this gene in the family detected amutation of c.1117A >G leading to a missense change of
aspartic acid-406 to glycine (Asp406Gly).
Targeted NGS is an extension of the candidate gene approach
is, and is a multiplexed method for screening many genes inparallel for detecting mutations. Using this method, analysis oftwenty candidate genes in ninety-two probands with LCA fromsouthern India led to the detection of mutations in about 60% ofcases ( Srikrupa et al., 2018 ). A similar investigation involving 152
patients with RP in a tertiary care referral centre in southern India
employed a targeted NGS panel of sixty-four genes. An unusually
high frequency of mutations was obtained for the ceramideKinase-Like 1 ( CERKL ) gene in this study. Mutations were
found in fourteen patients, out of whom twelve unrelatedpatients had a common mutation of c.1045_1046delAT. Onepatient had a nonsense mutation of c.847C >T (arginine-257 to
stop; Arg257Ter), and another had a splice site mutation of c.899-1G>A. Characteristic features such as disc pallor, arteriolar
attenuation, and variable degree of bony spicules were observedin these patients, along with macular atrophy ( Sen et al., 2020 ).
Recent studies have entailed whole exome analysis (WES) by
itself, in the absence of mapping. This mode has successfully
found disease-associated mutations in RP in certain studies inwhich single families and even single patients were screened. Anexample is a study of two consanguineous families from southernIndia with two affected individuals each. A mutation in theFAM161A gene was detected by WES, comprising a common
frameshift mutation at arginine-592 with termination after twoamino acids (Arg592fsX2) ( Zhou et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, in
this study, screening of a series of 100 sporadic patients with RPidenti ﬁed one more unrelated patient with the same mutation.
Another investigation with WES of two affected members in an
Indian family with early-onset RP and loss of vision within the
ﬁrst decade, detected a splice site mutation (c.1160 +1G >A) in
the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor ( AHR ) gene ( Zhou et al., 2018 ).
The mutation caused skipping of exon 9 of the AHR gene.
Another consanguineous family from north India with elevenmembers with early-onset rod-cone dystrophy studied by WES,had a nonsense mutation (tyrosine-549 to Stop; c.1647T >G;
Tyr549Ter) in the Mer-Tyrosine Kinase ( MERTK ) gene ( Bhatia
et al., 2019 ). Affected individuals in this family had pigment
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 858556 5Kannabiran et al. Inherited Retinal Diseases in Understudied Populationsdeposits, disc pallor, and attenuated retinal vessels in addition to
diffuse changes in the RPE. Finally, WES analysis of a single childwith RP from a consanguineous family in Andhra Pradeshdetected a substitution mutation in the TULP1 gene with
change of proline-388 to serine (c.1162C >T; Pro388Ser). The
patient presented with parafoveal atrophy of the RPE, bonespicule pigmentation in the mid-peripheral retina andattenuation of the retinal vasculature ( Woodard et al., 2021 ).
The mutation was observed to reduce the stability of the proteinas compared to the wild type when expressed in vitro .
Apart from RP and LCA, there are fewer reported genetic
studies of other retinal dystrophies in Indian patients. One suchexample is that of Best disease in families from southern India.Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) and Best vitelliformmacular dystrophy (BVMD) are both associated with mutations in
the Bestrophin 1 ( BEST1 ) gene. BVMD is autosomal dominant in
inheritance. Exome sequencing of four families, with a total of eightaffected members and twelve unaffected members led to thedetection of mutations in the BEST1 gene in all cases ( Nguyen
et al., 2018 ). The patients presented with visual loss in the ﬁrst to
third decades of life and the changes observed in the fundus werefoveal schisis, subretinal ﬂuid and vitelliform deposits. The
mutations detected in four separate families were-1) c.392A >G
with a change of tyrosine 131 to cysteine (p.Tyr131Cys); 2)missense change of arginine-150 to proline (p.Arg150Pro); 3)mutations c.140G >A (arginine-47 to histidine; Arg47His) and
c.646G >A (valine-216 to isoleucine; p.Val216Ile) in compound
heterozygous patient; 4) threonine-91 to isoleucine (p.Thr91Ile) ina heterozygous proband. The ﬁrst two mutations were found in
homozygous patients.
In addition, autosomal recessive cone dystrophy in a single
consanguineous family from northern India is associated with amutation in the CNGB3 (cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit
B3) gene ( Gupta et al., 2017 ). The disease in this family manifested
as poor vision since childhood, photophobia and abnormal colorvision. The fundus showed vascular attenuation, with changes inthe macular and mid-peripheral RPE. Electroretinographic
responses of cones were abnormal. Exome sequencing led to the
pathogenic change, a single base deletion of c.1148delC in CNGB3
predicting frameshift at threonine-383 (p.Thr383Fs), withhomozygosity in the affected individuals.
5 GENETICS OF RETINAL DYSTROPHIES IN
PAKISTAN
Analysis of pedigrees of extended families from Pakistan, often
consanguineous, facilitated the identi ﬁcation of many new loci for
retinal dystrophies. Table 2 has several examples of novel loci that
were mapped using a range of strategies, depending on thetechnologies available. In many earlier studies, methodsutilized to successfully ﬁnd the disease gene were linkage
analysis and sequencing of candidate genes in the mappedregion. More recently, particularly over the last decade, exomesequencing has been the dominant method to ﬁnd the genes
involved. In some instances as in the discovery of the USH1F
gene, comparison with a mouse deafness model for the disease,theavmouse, paved the way to ﬁnding the human gene ( Ahmed
et al., 2001 ). The disease gene in the avmouse, Pcdh15 , was
already known. Synteny between the human and mousechromosome 10 suggested that the human orthologue of the
mouse protocadherin 15 was the USH1F gene. Linkage analysis of
two families with Usher syndrome re ﬁned the USH1F locus.
Physical mapping of the critical interval for USH1F on
chromosome 10q21.1, and detection of sequence similarity inthis region to the murine Pcdh15 gene led to identi ﬁcation of the
human gene PCDH15 .
Another locus on chromosome 6q, the RP25 locus was also
mapped through a combination of linkage and physical mapping.In this case, two separate studies mapped the locus onchromosome 6q. Homozygosity mapping in a subset ofSpanish families with ARRP ( Ruiz et al., 1998 ), and an
independent study of a large consanguineous pedigree from
Pakistan, comprising twenty individuals, both localized thegene to an interval of 2 cM on chromosome 6q ( Khaliq et al.,
1999 ). Further bioinformatic and transcript analysis of the
sequences in the RP25 genomic interval revealed a novel gene,
EYS (human ortholog of the drosophila Eyes Shut gene). The
coding regions of EYS included 44 exons that extended over 2
megabases of genomic DNA. Mutations were found in threeunrelated families with RP in this gene, thus con ﬁrming its role in
the pathogenesis of the disease ( Collin et al., 2008 ).
The application of NGS has spurred the identi ﬁcation of genes
that were mapped in earlier studies by linkage. An example is the
RP32 locus, mapped on to chromosome 1p13-21 ( Zhang,
Zulﬁqar, Xiao et al., 2005 ), and identi ﬁed by exome
sequencing. Analysis of the sequence variants within thecritical interval identi ﬁed the RP32 gene as the Chloride
Channel CLIC like 1 ( CLCC1 ) gene. An ancestral mutation
was found in several families of Pakistani origin ( Li et al.,
2018 ). The CLCC1
gene encodes a putative chloride channel
and its knockdown in zebra ﬁsh and mouse has deleterious effects
on the photoreceptor layer of the retina. Comparable to the abovemethod is a combination of homozygosity mapping together with
whole exome sequencing. With this strategy, analysis of a family
of four affected individuals with ARRP using SNPs led to a singlehomozygous region being detected on chromosome 16. Analysisof exome variants located in the mapped interval resulted inidenti ﬁcation of the pathogenic change in the pre-mRNA splicing
factor gene, DHX38 (Ajmal et al., 2014 ).
Several more studies on families with retinal dystrophy from
Pakistan have detected mutations in known genes and they willnot be detailed here. There is a paucity of research on retinaldystrophies from other south Asian countries including Nepaland Bangladesh and they appear to be truly understudied in this
aspect with very few reports on these disorders, apart from
occasional cases and prevalence studies of blindness that arehospital-based.
6 CONCLUSION
There is enormous scope for the investigation of the genetics ofretinal dystrophies in India in particular and in South Asia, where
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 858556 6Kannabiran et al. Inherited Retinal Diseases in Understudied Populationsthe knowledge available in this ﬁeld is very sparse in relation to
the size of the affected population. The studies reported so far areindicative of the potential for gene discovery and for advancingour understanding of the genetic basis of these diseases in the
region. The geographic and physical connectivity within families
is still an inherent part of the social fabric. Such a situation offersan advantage to genetic studies of retinal dystrophies regardless ofthe methods that are employed, since the inclusion of extendedfamilies increases the scope for ﬁnding the underlying genes.
Communities with a high degree of consanguinity and inbreedingmay provide an opportunity to ﬁnd genes that are more prevalent
in them, due to common ancestry. This knowledge can eventuallybe used for targeted testing and counseling of families or fordesigning suitable therapies based on the genes involved.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS
