Abstract 
Purpose Stem cell therapy is a promising therapeutic approach for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). This study aims 
to quantitatively examine the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy for patients with IRDs, including retinitis 
pigmentosa and Stargardt disease (STGD).
Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library databases, and the ClinicalTrials.gov 
website. The latest retrieval time was August 20, 2023. The primary outcomes were rates and mean difference (MD) 
of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to administration 
routes and stem cell types. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022349271).
Results Twenty-one prospective studies, involving 496 eyes (404 RP and 92 STGD) of 382 patients (306 RP 
and 76 STGD), were included in this study. For RP , the rate of BCVA improvement was 49% and 30% at 6 months 
and 12 months, respectively, and the BCVA was significantly improved in the operative eyes at 6 months post-
treatment (MD = − 0.12 logMAR, 95% CI .17 to − 0.06 logMAR; P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference 
at 12 months post-treatment (MD = -0.06 logMAR; 95% CI − 0.13 to 0.01 logMAR; P = 0.10). For STGD, the rate of BCVA 
improvement was 60% and 55% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, and the BCVA was significantly improved 
in the operative eyes at 6 months (MD = − 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI − 0.22 to − 0.07 logMAR; P = 0.0002) and 12 months 
(MD = − 0.17 logMAR, 95% CI − 0.29 to − 0.04 logMAR; P = 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed suprachoroidal space 
injection of stem cells may be more efficient for RP . Eleven treated-related ocular adverse events from three studies 
and no related systemic adverse events were reported.
Conclusions This study suggests stem cell therapy may be effective and safe for patients with RP or STGD. The long-
term vision improvement may be limited for RP patients. Suprachoroidal space injection of stem cells may be a prom-
ising administration route for RP patients. Limited by the low grade of evidence, large sample size randomized clinical 
trials are required in the future.

Introduction
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of complex 
and heterogeneous diseases that are mainly character -
ized by progressive photoreceptors (PRs) and/or loss of 
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, eventually leading 
to irreversible vision loss [1]. It is estimated that approxi -
mately 1 in 2000 to 4000 people are affected by IRDs [2, 
3]. IRDs such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Stargardt 
disease (STGD) have become the most common cause of Open Access

blindness in the working-age population (16–64 years) in 
some Western countries [4, 5], which would impair the 
life quality of patients [6, 7], and cause severe social eco -
nomic burden [8, 9]. In the past, only genetic testing and 
low-vision rehabilitation were used for the management 
of IRDs and these could not effectively slow or stop vision 
loss of patients with IRDs. However, recent emerging 
treatments including gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and 
retinal prosthesis have entered the stage of clinical tri -
als and some therapies have shown inspiring therapeutic 
benefits in these vision-threatening disorders [10].
Among these treatment approaches for IRDs, stem cell 
therapy is considered a potential therapeutic method, 
which aims to replace lost cells in the retina with stem 
cells, mainly for those patients with IRDs who remained 
some useful retinal ganglion cells. Several types of stem 
cells, including retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), mesen -
chymal stem cells (MSCs), human embryonic stem cells-
derived RPE (hESCs-RPE) cells, and induced pluripotent 
stem cells-derived RPE (iPSCs-RPE) cells, have been 
examined their efficacy or safety for IRDs patients in clin -
ical trials [11].
Despite some results with small sample sizes from 
reviewed trials showing effectiveness and safety, no stud -
ies have been empowered to prove statistically significant 
efficacy for humans, and no stem cell therapy is approved 
for patients with IRDs [12]. The long-term efficacy and 
safety are controversial and required to be determined 
[13–17]. In addition, some parameters of stem cell ther -
apy for IRDs, such as administration routes and types of 
transplanted stem cells, are needed to optimize [18]. To 
date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has quantita -
tively examined the effectiveness of vision improvement 
and adverse events of stem cell therapy for patients with 
IRDs. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively assess 
these outcomes of stem cell therapy for patients with 
IRDs including RP and STGD and perform subgroup 
analyses stratified by administration routes and stem cell 
types in RP .
Methods
The protocol of this study was registered at PROSPERO 
(CRD42022349271, [http:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/ PROSP 
ERO/ ]). This meta-analysis was performed according to 
the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys -
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020 
statement) [19].
Search strategy
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and 
Cochrane Library databases. We also screened the refer -
ences from retrieved papers and the ClinicalTrials.gov 
website to identify additional related clinical studies and unpublished studies with available data. The following 
literature search terms were used (“Stem cell” OR “stem 
cells” OR “progenitor cell” OR “bone marrow”) AND 
(“Inherited retinal diseases” OR “inherited retinal degen -
eration” OR “hereditary retinal diseases” OR “inher -
ited retinal dystrophy” OR “retinitis pigmentosa” OR 
“Stargardt disease” OR “Stargardt macular dystrophy”). 
Neither the article language nor the retrieval time was 
limited. The latest retrieval time was August 20, 2023.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) Patients who are diagnosed with IRDs, including RP 
and STGD.
(2) Patients who have undergone stem cell therapy.
(3) Any clinical trials.
The exclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) Patients with other ocular disease except RP or 
STGD.
(2) Preclinical studies, letters to the editor, editorials, 
case reports, conference abstracts, and reviews.
(3) Studies without the assessment of primary out -
come.
Data extraction
Two researchers independently screened titles and 
abstracts according to the eligible criteria. All discrep -
ancies were resolved through adjudication by a third 
researcher. Extracted information included author name, 
publication year, country, study design, number of partic -
ipants, number of treated eyes, follow-up time, age, gen -
der, diagnosis, stem cells, administration routes, and cell 
concentration. For studies that reported similar results, 
only the most complete publication was included. The 
improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and 
ocular and systemic adverse events related to stem cell 
therapy were examined. The primary outcomes were the 
rate and mean difference (MD) of improvement of BCVA 
measured in the logarithm of the Minimum Angle of 
Resolution (logMAR).
Quality assessment
The Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) 
was used to assess the risk of bias in each cohort study 
[20]. Two researchers independently evaluate the quality 
of studies. All discrepancies were resolved through adju -
dication by a third researcher.Page 3 of 14

Statistical analysis
Meta-analyses were conducted using the Review Man -
ager (version 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration) and Stata 
SE (version 15.1). Visual acuity values were recorded as 
Snellen or logMAR, and Snellen values were converted 
to logMAR for analyses. LogMAR values correspond -
ing to count fingers (CF), hand movements (HM), and 
light perception (PL) were substituted with 2.0, 3.0, and 
4.0 logMAR, respectively, in accordance with the previ -
ous study [21]. Besides, no light perception (NLP) was 
substituted with 5.0. Snellen values provided in studies 
were converted to logMAR equivalents [22]. For stud -
ies provided The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopa -
thy Study (ETDRS) letter scores, we converted them 
to logMAR equivalents using the following formula 
logMAR = 1.7–(0.02) * (ETDRS letter scores) [23]. 
The mean difference (MD) and 95% confidential inter -
val (CI) were used to calculate. A fixed-effects model 
was used to assess the pool effect of changed log -
MAR, when no significant heterogeneity was detected 
(I2 ≤ 50% or P-value for heterogeneity ≥ 0.1). Otherwise, 
a random-effects model was used (I2 > 50% or p-value 
for heterogeneity < 0.1). Subgroup analyses were per -
formed stratified by types of stem cells and adminis -
tration routes. The publication bias was detected using 
funnel plots and Begg’s test. The statistical significance 
was set at P  < 0.05.
Results
Literature search
The initial retrieval identified 2013 nonduplicated 
articles. Records that were not relevant to our topic 
were excluded (n  = 1129). After screening titles and 
abstracts, studies were excluded according to inclusion 
criteria (n  = 677). Full-text evaluation was performed in 
the remaining 217 studies. Ultimately, 21 unique stud -
ies were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1 ).
Characteristics of included studies
Twenty-one prospective studies, involving 496 eyes 
(404 RP and 92 STGD) of 382 patients (306 RP and 76 
STGD), were included in this study [14, 15, 24–42]. 
One study included RP and STGD patients [25]. Eight 
studies were for STGD [26, 28, 29, 36–38, 40, 42], and 
twelve studies were for RP [14, 15, 24, 27, 30–35, 39, 
41], of which one study involved pediatric patients [41]. 
The mean follow-up duration was 14.4 ± 12.8  months 
(RP: 10.5 ± 5.0  months; STGD: 19.1 ± 18.1  months), 
ranging from 6 to 60 months (5 years). Detailed char -
acteristics of the included studies are presented in 
Table 1 .The rate of best‑corrected vison acuity improvement 
after stem cell therapy
For RP , 49% and 30% operative eyes achieved bet -
ter BCVA at 6 months and 12 months post-treatment, 
respectively. For STGD, 60% and 55% operative eyes 
achieved better BCVA at 6  months and 12  months 
post-treatment, respectively (Table 2 ).
Improvement in best‑corrected visual acuity after stem cell 
therapy
For RP , the BCVA was significantly improved in 
the operative eyes at 6  months post-treatment 
(MD = −  0.12 logMAR, 95% CI −   0.17 to −   0.06 log -
MAR; P < 0.001) (Fig.  2), while there was no significant 
difference at 12 months post-treatment (MD = 0.06 log -
MAR; 95% CI −  0.13 to 0.01 logMAR; P  = 0.10) (Fig. 3 ).
For STGD, the BCVA was significantly improved 
in the operative eyes at 6  months post-treatment 
(MD = −  0.14 logMAR, 95% CI −   0.22 to −   0.07 log -
MAR; P = 0.0002) (Fig.  4) and 12 months (MD = − 0.17 
logMAR, 95% CI −   0.29 to −   0.04 logMAR; P  = 0.01) 
(Fig. 5 ).
Subgroup analyses
For improvement in BCVA of RP patients at 6 months 
post-treatment, we performed subgroup analyses 
according to the administration routes and types of 
stem cells. For administration routes, suprachoroidal 
space injection showed the best BCVA improvement 
at 6  months post-treatment (MD = −  0.18 logMAR, 
95% CI −   0.29 to −   0.07 logMAR; P  = 0.001) (Fig.  6). 
For types of stem cells, umbilical cord MSCs (UCM -
SCs) injection showed the best BCVA improvement at 
6  months post-treatment (MD = −  0.14 logMAR, 95% 
CI − 0.23 to −  0.04 logMAR; P  = 0.004) (Fig. 7 ).
Publication bias
The funnel plots demonstrated the improvement in 
BCVA at 6 months after stem cell therapy for patients 
with RP (Fig.  8, P for Begg’s test: 0.170) and STGD 
(Fig.  9, P for Begg’s test: 0.652). No significant publica -
tion bias was detected.
Systemic and ocular adverse events
Eleven treated-related ocular adverse events from 
three studies and no related systemic adverse events 
were reported for RP patients [15, 30, 35]. One study 
reported three tractional retinal detachments (RD) 
[35]. One study with long-term follow-up reported 
a case that experienced diffuse vitreous hemorrhage 
and osseous metaplasia in the ciliary body in the third 
year of follow-up and a case that developed minimal Page 4 of 14 Chen et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy          (2023) 14:286 
intraocular lens subluxation in the fourth year of fol -
low-up [15]. Another study reported a case that devel -
oped choroidal neovascular membrane (CNM) and five 
cases had epiretinal membrane (ERM) with peripheral 
tractional RD [30].
Discussion
Our study was in line with previous systemic reviews 
which confirmed stem cell therapy was an effective and 
relatively safe treatment for patients with RP or STGD 
[16, 43, 44]. This present study, including 21 studies 
and 496 eyes, was the first to quantitatively assess the 
improvement of BCVA in patients with RP or STGD 
who had undergone stem cell therapy. The change of 
logMAR of STGD patients was significantly improved 
at 6 and 12  months. However, although the BCVA of 
RP patients was significantly improved at 6 months, this improvement was no longer significant at 12 months. A 
study that used RPC cells to treat RP patients showed 
that vision improvement did not appear at 24  months 
after stem cell therapy [14]. In addition, another study 
used hESC-RPE cells to treat STGD patients showed 
worse BCVA at 60  months after stem cell therapy [37]. 
The incidence of adverse events after stem cell therapy 
was low, and most of them were mild ocular adverse 
events, but the safety of stem cell therapy for patients 
with RP or STGD requires attention. One study reported 
the first five cases developed peripheral tractional RD 
and one case happened CNM [30]. They considered 
these complications may be attributed to inadvertent 
preretinal injection of stem cells or reflux of transplanted 
stem cells from the subretinal space [45]. After modify -
ing the surgical operation, the remaining patients did not 
have adverse events. Our results showed suprachoroidal Records searched through databases

space injection showed optimally improved logMAR 
at 6  months with no serious ocular or systemic adverse 
events reported, indicating this may be a better admin -
istration route of stem cell therapy for RP patients. The 
standardized surgical procedures were important to the 
safety of stem cell therapy. These findings suggest that 
stem cell transplantation is efficient and relatively safe 
for patients with RP or STGD, but long-term efficacy is 
uncertain for RP . Weiss et al. indicated that the efficacy 
of stem cell therapy would be affected by the severity 
of RP [27]. Meanwhile, the patients with longer disease 
duration gained less vision improvement, compared 
to those with shorter duration of RP [35]. In the meta-
analysis showing the efficacy of stem cell therapy for RP 
at 12  months, five in seven studies were advanced RP . 
Marginally significant improvement was observed in the 
remaining two studies at 12 months (data not shown) [35, 
41].
Stem cells have a strong ability to proliferate and dif -
ferentiate into many kinds of cells, including RPE cells, 
PRs, and RGCs. The transplanted stem cells function mainly by secreting neurotrophic factors, replacing the 
degenerative cells in the host, upregulating anti-apop -
totic genes, and forming new functional synapses [46]. In 
2016, researchers proposed a new potential mechanism 
that host and grafted cells could happen material trans -
fer to rescue the host degenerative retina [47], and this 
mechanism was further verified by subsequent studies 
[48, 49]. Despite the inspiring results in clinical trials, the 
exact mechanisms underlying stem cell therapy for IRDs 
are necessary to explore.
Currently, three common methods are applied to 
deliver stem cells into the eye: intravitreal injection, sub -
retinal injection, and suprachoroidal injection. Intravit -
real injection is a relatively simple and safe procedure, 
and this method is widely used for treating retinal dis -
eases [50]. However, an intact blood-retinal barrier lim -
ited the transport of transplanted stem cells and stem 
cell-secreted neurotrophic factors [51]. Another serious 
problem is that the drug can diffuse to nontarget regions 
such as lens and subretinal space and then trigger fibrous 
tissue proliferation and lead to RD and ERM [17, 52]. Table 2 The rate of the best-corrected visual acuity improvement after stem cell therapy at 6 months and 12 months

Although some clinical studies have reported the general 
safety of stem cell therapy for RP patients, this method 
should be taken into rigorous consideration before being 
used [15, 35]. Subretinal injection aims to deliver stem 
cells to the potential space between RPE and PR, which 
can directly target the retina. Although this method 
involves a pars plana vitrectomy which may lead RD and 
vitrectomy-associated complications, the successful use 
of hESC-RPE in subretinal space has shown its relative 
safety when carefully using the right techniques [53]. The 
suprachoroidal space (SCS) is a potential space, between 
the choroid and sclera. SCS injection is a novel adminis -
tration route to the posterior segment, which accurately 
targets the choroid, RPE, and neuroretina, with high bioavailability [54]. Limoli et al. first described the supra -
choroidal implantation method of stem cells (they called 
it the Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique, LRRT) [55–
57]. This method allows stem cell-produced growth fac -
tors to enter the choroidal blood flow. In this study, the 
exact mechanism underlying the better efficacy of SCS 
injection is not clear. One possible explanation is that 
no ocular adverse events, such as RD and ERM which 
can impair vision, were reported for the safe SCS injec -
tion, compared to intravitreal and subretinal injection. 
In addition, the accumulation and distribution of drug 
in the SCS can achieve sustained release [58], which may 
allow stem cell-derived growth factors to be constantly 
secreted to the choroid and retina. For those patients Fig. 6 Subgroup analyses showed different administration routes on the best-corrected visual acuity improvement for RP at 6 monthsPage 10 of 14 Chen et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy          (2023) 14:286 
who need to inject cell suspension multiply, less inva -
sive SCS inject may be a suitable administration route. 
For the emerging transplantation of stem cells sheet with 
the technique of tissue engineering for IRDs, subretinal 
injection is still the first choice [59].
In this present study, most RP patients were injected 
with MSCs. MSCs represent the most frequently stud -
ied type of adult stem cells, which are derived from stro -
mal progenitor cells of mesodermal origin [60]. MSCs 
are found in various parts of the human body, and bone 
MSCs (BMSCs), adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADM -
SCs), and UCMSCs are the three main MSCs used to 
research IRDs, and they have similar function properties 
[61, 62]. Several important properties of MSCs include 
immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, and secretion of 
neurotrophic factors [60]. Compared to other stem cells, 
easier isolation from tissues makes MSCs a promising 
candidate for IRDs. Besides, MSC-derived extracellular 
vesicles are considered beneficial to retinitis pigmentosa [63]. Our results showed that UCMSCs may be a poten -
tial MSCs type for patients with RP . Currently, clinical 
trials are focused on the transplantation of hESCs-RPE 
or iPSCs-RPE to treat retinal degeneration [18]. Both 
ESCs and iPSCs can be successfully differentiated into 
PRs, RPE cells, and other retinal cells and are seemed 
a promising way to treat IRDs [64]. In 2012, Schwartz 
et  al. first reported the preliminary results using hESC-
RPE to treat two retinal diseases including age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and STGD [65]. Sub -
sequently, a plethora of clinical trials showed inspir -
ing results of hESC for treating RP [11] and STGD [44]. 
However, ethical concerns limit the use of hESCs; thus, 
iPSCs are considered a potential alternative to avoid the 
above problems. In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka first 
discovered iPSCs, which can be derived from embryonic 
or adult fibroblasts in mouse by introducing four tran -
scription factors [66]. Then, they described this type of 
stem cells can be obtained from human skin fibroblasts Fig. 7 Subgroup analyses showed different stem cell types on the best-corrected visual acuity improvement for RP at 6 monthsPage 11 of 14
 Chen et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy          (2023) 14:286 
 
and peripheral blood in 2007 [67]. Like hESCs, iPSCs 
were soon reported to be able to differentiate into reti -
nal cells in  vitro in 2009 [68]. In 2011, milestone study investigated a self-organized 3D optic cup and stratified 
RPE from mouse iPSCs, creating the research field of ret -
inal organoids [69]. In 2012, Li et al. reported a method Fig. 8 The funnel plot for the best-corrected visual acuity improvement for patients with RP at 6 months
Fig. 9 The funnel plot for the best-corrected visual acuity improvement for patients with STGD at 6 monthsPage 12 of 14 Chen et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy          (2023) 14:286 
to obtain and transplant iPSC-RPE cells into RP mouse 
model, which was considered a pioneering study on the 
use of iPSC in the field of retinal diseases [70]. In 2014, 
RIKEN reported the first clinical trial using autologous 
iPSCs-RPE to treat a patient with AMD; the vision of 
this patient was not improved or worsened [71]. Then the 
first clinical trial using iPSC-retina which was prepared 
from retinal organoids to treat advanced RP was started 
by Kobe City Eye Hospital in 2020 [72]. Despite some 
challenges, scientific researchers spare no effort to pave 
the way for the practical application of stem cell therapy 
for patients suffering from retinal degeneration [59, 73].
Some limitations exist in this study. First, we did not 
evaluate the data from fundus autofluorescence, electro -
retinogram, and optical coherence tomography, because 
the sample size was small or these data could not be 
extracted and synthesized for meta-analysis. Second, 
subgroup analyses were only performed in RP patients at 
6 months after stem cell therapy. Besides, the number of 
studies in each subgroup was small in subgroup analyses. 
Third, the definition of serious ocular events differs and 
lacks standardized criteria.
Conclusions
This study suggests stem cell therapy may be effective and 
safe for patients with RP or STGD. The long-term vision 
improvement may be limited for RP patients. Supra -
choroidal space injection of stem cells may be a promis -
ing administration route for RP patients. Limited by the 
grade of evidence, large sample sizes and well-designed 
multi-center randomized controlled trials with long fol -
low-up periods are required in the future.
