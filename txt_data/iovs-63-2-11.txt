https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.63.2.11PURPOSE.To assess the potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to
characterizecasesdiagnosedwithautosomalrecessive(ar)orsporadic(s)maculardystro-
phies (ar/sMD) and describe their mutational spectrum.
METHODS.A cohort of 1036 families was classified according to their suspected clini-
cal diagnosis—Stargardt disease (STGD), cone and cone-rod dystrophy (CCRD) or other
maculopathies (otherMD). Molecular studies included genotyping microarrays, Sanger
sequencing, NGS, and sequencing of intronic regions of the ABCA4gene.Clinical reclas-
sification was done after the genetic study.
RESULTS.At the end of the study, 677 patients (65%) had a confirmed genetic diagno-
sis, representing 78%, 63%, and 38% of STGD, CCRD, and otherMD groups of patients,
respectively. ABCA4is the most mutated gene in all groups, and a second pathogenic
variantwasfoundin76%ofSTGDpatientswithonepreviouslyidentifiedmutated ABCA4
allele. Autosomal dominant or X-linked mutations were found in 5% of cases together
with not-MD genes ( CHM, EYS, RHO, RPGR, RLBP1, OPA1 ,a n d USH2Aamong others)
leading to their reclassification.Novel variants in the very rare genes PLA2G5 andTTLL5
revealed additional phenotypic associations.
CONCLUSIONS .This study provides for the first time a genetic landscape of 1036 ar/sMD
families according to their suspected diagnosis. The analysis of >200 genes associated
with retinal dystrophies and the entire locus of ABCA4increase the rate of characteri-
zation, even regardless of available clinical and familiar data. The use of the suspected
a priori diagnosis referred by the clinicians, especially in the past, could lead to clinical
reclassifications to other inherited retinal dystrophies.

Inherited macular dystrophies (MD) comprise a hetero-
geneous group of disorders characterized by bilateral
central visual loss and atrophy of the macula and underly-
ing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).The hallmark of these
diseases is a loss of visual acuity, that could affect people
in every age. The genetic spectrum of MD is very hetero-
geneous. All patterns of inheritance have been associated
with these diseases. The different forms of macular degen-
eration encompass a wide range of clinical and histological
findings.1Different types of MD include recessive juvenile
Stargardt disease,2dominant forms of Best disease,3adult
vitelliform macular disease,4pattern dystrophies,5X-linked(XL) juvenile retinoschisis,6and age-related macular degen-
eration,7among others.
Other inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD), such as cone
and cone-rod dystrophies (CCRD), are commonly clinically
related with MD because they also involve progressive
degeneration or dysfunction of the central retina due to
photoreceptor degeneration and lead to a similar vision
loss.8Fullfieldelectroretinography(ERG)recordingshelpto
distinguish among these related diseases, with normal find-
ings in MD, only reduced cone responses in cone dystro-
phies (CD) and both cone and rod responses reduced in
cone-rod dystrophies (CRD).

Stargardt disease (STGD), the most frequent maculopa-
thy, was described as a neuroepithelial disease affecting
cones, RPE, and the underlying choroid.9Autosomal reces-
sive Stargardt disease (STGD1; OMIM no. 248200) is caused
by biallelic mutations in the ABCA4gene.10This gene is also
associated to CRD, depending on the severity of the vari-
ants found in patients.11–15More than 1200 disease-causing
ABCA4variants have been described, including missense,
nonsense, small indels, copy-number,16and, more recently,
non-canonical splice site and deep intronic variants that
lead to splicing defects.17–22This remarks the importance
of sequencing noncoding regions in STGD patients and
performing functional assays to unveil the pathogenicity of
noncoding variants.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow
studying a high number of genes and patients paral-
lelly using exome-targeted approaches or customized gene
panels to also include noncoding regions and identifying
new candidate genes.23In the pre-NGS era, genetic testing
of IRD patients was performed using genotyping microar-
rays or Sanger sequencing,which were time-consuming and
had low diagnostic rates due to failure to detect previously
unknown mutations or new genes.
In this work we report the findings achieved before and
after the implementation of NGS for the study of a large
cohort of 1036 autosomal recessive or sporadic MD and
CCRD (hereinafter, ar/sMD) families at the Genetic Depart-
ment of the University Hospital Fundación Jimenez Diaz, an
IRD reference laboratory testing the largest number of IRD
patients in Spain.24Almost 70% of ar/sMD patients had a
molecular diagnosis at the end of this study, and we high-

worldwide population.
METHODS
Subjects and Samples
A cohort of 1036 unrelated families with ar/sMD was
recruited at the Fundación Jiménez Díaz University Hospi-
tal (HUFJD, Madrid, Spain) since 1991 up to October 2020.
Our laboratory receives internal and external referrals for
patients with suspected IRD from different genetic and
ophthalmologic services throughout Spain. DNA samples
werecollectedfromtheHUFJDBiobank,andallparticipants
or their legal guardians signed an informed consent before
being included in this study. This study was performed in
accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of our institu-
tion.
Clinical Diagnosis and Molecular Characterization
Patients were included when they were referred to the
GeneticsDepartmentofHUFJDwiththefollowingdiagnosis
and were classified according to it: (I) STGD cases, patients
with a clinical suspicion of STGD or fundus flavimaculatus;
(II) CCRD cases, patients with a clinical suspicion of CD or
CRD;and (III) otherMD cases,patients referred with a suspi-
cion of macular dystrophy, Best disease, vitelliform macular
dystrophy, drusen maculopathy, pattern dystrophy, central
areolar choroidal dystrophy, and retinoschisis.
Inaddition,theywereclassifiedaccordingtotheavailable
data about the inheritance pattern in: (I) autosomal reces-sive (ar), when there were two or more affected individuals
in the same generation (N =283), (II) sporadic cases, in
families with a single diagnosed patient reported (N =707),
or (III) unknown (N =46), when clinicians did not report
family information. Patients referred with an a priori domi-
nant (AD) or XL pattern of inheritance were excluded.
A total of 1036 probands were studied by one or
more genetic approaches (Supplementary Table S1). Until
2017, screening of patients with suspicion of ar/sMD was
performed most commonly by genotyping microarrays and
Sanger sequencing of coding regions of ABCA4as first-tier
testing approaches.25–28Some unsolved patients were also
screened by NGS when they gave their permission and DNA
had enough quality,sequencing the genomic ABCA4locus29
and using small NGS-targeted gene panels for up to 82 IRD
genes.30A few families were also analyzed by whole exome
sequencing (WES).31,32
After the implementation of NGS in our laboratory in
2017,screening of new cases is routinely performed by clin-
ical exome-targeted approaches prioritizing up to 229 IRD-
associated genes.30,33–35A few cases were sequenced for the
ABCA4gene(AsperBiogene,Tartu,Estonia).Formostofthe
studied unsolved cases in which one pathogenic variant was
found in ABCA4, several approaches were further applied
depending on their availability: gene panels covering
specific noncoding ABCA4variants previously reported,36
the targeted sequencing of the complete coding or noncod-
ingABCA4 regions,22or Sanger sequencing of specific
ABCA4deep intronic variants known to be prevalent in
Spanish population (c.4253 +43G>A, c.4539 +2064C >T, and
c.5196 +1137G >A)35(Supplementary Table S1). In all these
analyses, variants were prioritized and their pathogenicity
was established following the guidelines of the American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics,37as previously
described.34
Statistical Analysis
Different analyses were performed considering: (I) clinical
groups (STGD, CCRD and otherMD); (II) genotype status:
(a) biallelic ABCA4patients; (b) other IRD-associated genes;
(c) monoallelic ABCA4patients; and (d) unsolved patients;
and (III) period of their study: (before and after 2017,
when implementing exome sequencing). McNemar test and
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were done
using R version 4.0.3.
RESULTS
Until October 2020, a total of 1036 ar/sMD cases had
been studied, 744 recruited until 2017, and 292 new cases
recruited during 2017–2020 period. Of them, 570, 223, and
243presentedaclinicalsuspecteddiagnosisofSTGD,CCRD,
and otherMD, respectively.

Pathogenic variants in other genes were identified in 17% (31/183) and 11% (12/107) of CCRD and otherMD cases, respectively. Finally, 364
patients remained unsolved, including 60 that were monoallelic for ABCA4.(B) After exome sequencing and screening of ABCA4introns. A
total of 1036 ar/sMD cases were studied or restudied by the end of this study,October 2020.Three quarters of STGD patients (425/570) were
characterized with biallelic ABCA4mutations, 3% (19/570) presented a single pathogenic variant in this gene, and 3% (19/570) presented
mutations in other IRD genes.The 19% (107/570) of studied patients remained genetically unsolved.Among the CCRD cases,a 38% (85/223)
were found to carry mutations in ABCA4,and one-quarter (55/223) presented mutations in other IRD genes.In the case of otherMD patients,

Current Genetic Landscape of ar/sMD
From 2017 until the end of this study, 292 new cases were
recruited and studied with a first approach of clinical exome(89%; 259/292) or by sequencing coding regions of the
ABCA4gene (33/292) (Supplementary Table S1). Solved
patients were 134 and 18, respectively, resulting in a diag-
nosticyieldof52%(152/292).Segregationstudieshavebeen
performed in 35% of them (54/152).
Twenty-seven of the new cases unsolved by clinical
exome were further studied sequencing the entire ABCA4
gene due to the clinical suspicion of the patient or the
presence of one pathogenic allele in this gene, identifying

The diagnostic yields for the 1036 ar/sMD cases were

The diagnostic yield for ABCA4solved and unsolved cases
showed statistically significant differences between STGD
versus CCRD, STGD versus otherMD, and CCRD versus
otherMD ( P<0.001). The increase in the diagnostic yield
of patients solved with other genes was statistically signifi-

(26/39) of monoallelic ABCA4patients were unsuccessfully
screened for noncoding variants.
Genetic and Clinical Reclassification
A total of 677 families were genetically characterized after
the molecular study.As expected,95% of them carried reces-
sivevariants(647/677).Otherpathogenicvariantsassociated
withanADorXLinheritancepatternswerefoundin23(4%)
and seven (1%) families, respectively, both with an a priori
ar inheritance pattern, sporadic, or without familiar data
(Supplementary Table S2). In four AD-reclassified cases it
was confirmed that one of the parents was actually affected.In three XL-reclassified cases, other unreported male rela-
tives were also affected in the family. Segregation analysis
was performed in eight cases, identifying incomplete pene-
trance in two families with reported unaffected relatives
carrying previously reported CRXand PRPH2pathogenic
variants, respectively.
Regarding clinical reclassification, some mutations were
in genes typically associated with diseases other than those
that the respective patients had (Supplementary Table S2).
In STGD group, although most of the patients carried bial-
lelic ABCA4variants, some patients presented pathogenic
variants in genes causing STGD-like phenotypes ( PRPH2
andPLA2G5) and other types of IRDs or eye diseases: CD
(CNGB3), CRD or RP ( CERKL, CRB1, CRX, EYS, PROM1 and
RP2), Best disease ( BEST1), choroideremia ( CHM), optic
atrophy ( OPA1), and retinoschisis ( RS1).
Within the CCRD group of patients,11 patients presented
variants in RP genes as CERKL, CNGB1, RHO, RPGR and
USH2A, three patients were reclassified to Bestrophinopa-
thy ( BEST1), three to LCA ( CRB1andRPGRIP1 ) because of
their early age at onset, and one patient presented congen-
ital stationary night blindness with pathogenic variants in
TRPM1. This last patient was diagnosed with retinal dystro-
p h ya ta g eo n ey e a r .
Finally, in the group of otherMD patients we found 35
patients with ABCA4variants that were classified to STGD1
or CRD, eight patients classified to CD ( CNGB3, GUCYD2
andPDE6C), 36 patients with CRD ( BBS1, CDHR1, CNGA3,
CRB1, CRX, PROM1, PRPH2, RDH12 )o rR P( CERKL,RLBP1

(CRB1), and one with retinoschisis ( RS1).

DISCUSSION
In this work, we report the genetic diagnosis of 1036
ar/sMD families studied for 30 years. The genetic test-
ing options for studying patients with IRD are numer-
ous and have progressed over time.39First approaches
used in our laboratory—genotyping microarrays and Sanger
sequencing—before NGS allowed characterizing half of
studied patients, most of them carrying ABCA4pathogenic
coding variants.
In recent years, NGS technologies have had a substantial
impact in the molecular diagnosis of IRD patients.23Here,
theuseofcustomizedNGS-basedpanelscovering >70genessolved nearly 40% of ar/sMD cases, whereas their use for
other IRD families of our cohort showed variable mutation
rates of 27% and 57% in autosomal dominant and reces-
sivecases,respectively.40,41Therestudyofunsolvedcasesby
the implementation of clinical exome sequencing >200 IRD
genes or noncoding regions of ABCA4have allowed charac-
terizing the 58% of the restudied cases.When clinical exome
was used as the first-tier approach in the new cases, the
characterization rate decreased to 52%. Other authors using
NGS custom gene panels of >300 IRD-associated genes and
noncoding regions reported a diagnosis yield of 85%.42The
differences in the characterization rate found between the
restudied cases and the new cases can be explained by
several reasons. First, both cohorts have been recruited in
different periods of time and do not have the same number
of patients in each clinical group. Although most of the
restudied patients have a STGD diagnosis (52%), new cases
included more otherMD diagnosis (46%) than STGD diag-
nosis (40%). As we have seen in this study, in this otherMD
clinicalgroup,thereisthehighestrateofunsolvedcases.We
suggest that in this miscellaneous group where most of the
patients are referred with “macular dystrophy,” there may
be nonhereditary cases. Second, additional regions studied
by WES or the entire ABCA4gene have been screened in
restudied cases, representing the 2% and 32% of the total
of characterized restudied cases, respectively. In 20 of these
patients (8% of total restudied cases), we found pathogenic
variants in genes not included in the clinical exome— TTLL5
case—ordeepintronicvariantsinthe ABCA4gene.However,
theremainingpatientscharacterizedaftertherestudyshould
have been solved if they had been sequenced by clin-
ical exome as first approach. For all these reasons, theGenetic Landscape of Inherited Macular Dystrophies IOVS | February 2022 | Vol. 63 | No. 2 | Article 11 | 7
characterization rate obtained in this study is specific for
each cohort and cannot be compared.
Three-quarters of patients referred with STGD diagno-
sis were biallelic for the ABCA4gene, which is expected
because Stargardt disease is due to mutations in this gene
(STGD1).16The ABCA4gene was also the most frequent
gene mutated in CCRD and otherMD groups, representing
38% and 14% of the total of studied patients, respectively.
It is well known that there are missing alleles in the
ABCA4 gene in unsolved patients with one pathogenic
allele.16The fact that the monoallelic cases for the ABCA4
gene were only significantly reduced in the group of STGD
diagnosissupportsthenecessityofsequencingthecomplete
ABCA4gene in those cases with a clear diagnosis of Star-
gardt disease to find a second pathogenic variant. In most
cases,whenall50codingexonshavebeenalreadyscreened,
this is likely located in deep-intronic regions22or regulatory
regions.21At the end of our study, the frequency of monoal-
lelic ABCA4patients found in all groups of clinical diagno-
sis is between 3% to 6%. Pathogenic noncoding variants still
could not be discarded in 54% of the total of monoallelic
ABCA4patients in which the complete sequencing of the
ABCA4locus has not been performed, including nine STGD
patients, six of whom were unsuccessfully screened for the
prevalent Spanish intronic variants.However,it is important
toremarkthatonly1.6%ofthemutatedallelesinthe ABCA4
gene are deep intronic pathogenic variants, as we described
before.35Nevertheless, our hypothesis is that most of these
patients, specially CCRD and otherMD patients, could be
merelycarriersofavariantinthemostfrequentIRDmutated
gene,43as is also supported by previous studies reflecting a
carrier rate of 6% for ABCA4in Spanish population.28
Other genes different from ABCA4known to cause other
MD or IRD were identified in the group of suspected STGD
cases.Mutationsin PRPH2havebeenassociated withSTGD-
like phenotypes,16but with an AD-inheritance pattern. This
fact could be explained by the limited clinical information
from relatives together with the reported incomplete pene-
trance and variable expressivity in this gene.44Other genes
associated to specific IRD-phenotypes with clinical features
other than STGD were found in patients in whom no clin-
ical information apart from their referred STGD diagnosis
was available. Mutations in IRD-genes causing phenotypes
different from STGD have also been reported when study-
ing a priori STGD cases.45Genes associated to RP,LCA,optic
atrophy, retinoschisis and Best disease were found in the
groups of CCRD and otherMD. This reflects that the clinical
entity can be accurately defined when sequencing a large
number of IRD-associated genes, as has been addressed
before.42The ideal scenario in those cases would be to
collect ophthalmological information after the genetic study
to provide a complete clinical reclassification. Moreover, in
unsolved cases with a specific diagnosis, as the case of
STGD patients,additional clinical examinations might reveal
initial misdiagnosis, when both imaging technologies and
the knowledge on retinal diseases was not as advanced as
currently.
Remarkably,we identified a homozygous novel variant in
the gene PLA2G5 in two unrelated probands with STGD-like
phenotype. This gene was first associated with benign fleck
retina,46a condition that was added to the classification of
the fleck disorders described by Krill and Folk,47and where
patients have no functional defect.48Sergouniotis et al.46
identified seven patients with yellow-white retinal lesions
and no visual deficits carrying PLA2G5 mutations. No otherpatients have been reported to date to our knowledge, with
ourtwopatientsbeingtheeighthandninthcaseswithmuta-
tions in this very rare gene. Our patients presented a fleck
retina disorder involving the macula and different from the
benign condition because they are symptomatic and have a
mild functional dysfunction of vision. This may suggest that
PLA2G5 gene could also been involved in retinal degenera-
tion with functional disturbances on vision. The novel vari-
ant identified in the last exon of this gene leads to the trun-
cation of the protein group V phospholipase A 2(PLA2G5) at
amino acid 103, located before the aspartic acid amino acid
at 111 position that is responsible for catalytic activity of the
protein.49
The high-throughput genetic analysis by NGS could be
successful, although the family history was ambiguous or
the clinical manifestation was atypical.42On the one hand,
most of the patients included in this work were sporadic
cases in which apparently the proband had not affected
relatives, and, in few cases, there is no available informa-
tion of the family members.As expected,95% of these cases
were confirmed to have an autosomal recessive pattern of
inheritance after the identification of the mutated gene, and
in 52% of them it was confirmed that each mutated allele
was received from one progenitor. However, when variants
in AD- or XL-associated genes were identified, as in the
remaining5% of patients,having clinical information of rela-
tives and segregation studies are important to give accurate
genetic counseling.
Finally,only 35% of the total ar/sMD patients were genet-
ically unsolved; however, NGS screening has not been yet
performed in a quarter. An extended analysis of noncod-
ing and regulatory regions together with functional assays,
and the identification of new genes causing IRD would be
needed to characterize unsolved cases. Also, structural vari-
ants affecting genomic domains may be involved.50
This study provides a genetic landscape of 1036 ar/sMD
families,giving a mutational spectrum of the genes involved
in STGD, CCRD, and otherMD groups of patients according
to their suspected diagnosis. We demonstrate the increase
of the characterization diagnostic yield after the implemen-
tation of the exome sequencing even when no clinical and
familiar data are available. Also, a new phenotypic associ-
ation with a visual defect is described for the rare gene
PLA2G5.
