Abstract
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures have the potential to uniquely capture patient 
experience and serve as an outcome measure in inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) gene therapy 
trials. An IRD-specific patient-reported outcome measure may yield valuable information that has 
not been obtained from inherited retinal dystrophy gene therapy trials published to-date. Existing 
PRO measures have inherent limitations for use in IRD gene therapy trials. Developing an 
applicable patient-reported outcome measure for such trials needs to incorporate patient input 
from the target population, demonstrate sound psychometric properties, and be made in 
accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines,. This review will discuss 
the currently available PRO instruments, their limitations for IRD therapeutic trials, and 
suggestions for future PRO development in IRD populations. The PRO instruments highlighted 
were identified in PubMed search of English-language journals and previously published review 
articles.

Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are generally slowly progressing diseases that are 
caused by pathogenic variants in a given gene. Notably, patients with rod-cone dystrophy 
often complain of lack of peripheral vision, limited contrast sensitivity, and poor low-light 
vision which can all lead to substantial limitations in daily life ( 1–4). Certain IRDs may 
follow a common progression pattern, such as degeneration beginning in the periphery, then 
progressing centrally, and causing a tunnel vision effect. Depending on the type of IRD, 
either rods or cones may be disproportionally affected resulting in variable deficits in night, 
peripheral, central, or color vision. Despite some commonalities, the effects of retinal 
dystrophies are unique to the individual patient.
Often clinical tests are limited in their ability to describe patients’ vision impairment in the 
context of the real world( 4–6). For example, a patient may have 20/20 visual acuity, but be 
unable to walk through an unfamiliar room due to a severely constrained visual field or due 
to the background illumination. Common clinical measures--visual acuity, visual field, 
contrast sensitivity, and electroretinogram (ERG) -- do not always reflect patient experience 
(3–5). Furthermore, these tests have challenges in the reliability of repeated 
measurements( 7–12).
Until recently those diagnosed with IRDs had no treatment options. Today, therapeutic 
advances, such as gene therapy, are providing new possibilities for IRD treatment, and 
clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapies are active in centers 
around the world. With the rapid advancements of these therapies, experts have already 
identified the need for standardized outcome measures and testing protocols( 13).
Most importantly, as new treatments are developed, it is critical to evaluate whether or not 
the changes or improvements are meaningful to the patient( 14). This, combined with the 
limitations in existing functional outcome measures, calls for the development of a sensitive, 
reliable, and validated measure to capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for use in IRD 
therapeutic trials.
The present review includes discussion of existing literature and clinical trials. Patient-
reported outcome measures in this review were identified in a PubMed search using 
keywords of “patient-reported outcome”, “questionnaire”, “retinal dystrophy”, “inherited 
retinal disease”, “retinitis pigmentosa”. The search was limited to PubMed indexed English-
language journals and PROs identified in previous reviews that are disease-specific to a 
condition of inherited retinal degeneration.
In this review, we will discuss the use of PRO instruments, status of current PROs, and 
recommendations for PRO development. There will be particular emphasis on three key 
features of PRO development described by the FDA and their particular importance in IRD 
gene therapy populations. A validated PRO measure is an instrument that has undergone a 
qualitative analysis of in-depth patient interviews as well as thorough quantitative statistical 
analysis to determine the measure’s reliability and ability to detect change in the target 
population. After a review of the existing PRO literature, we have found the existing Lacy et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinstruments do not fully meet the needs of a PRO for gene therapy clinical trials therapy and 
suggest the development of a novel PRO for this application.
Why use PRO Instruments?
Patient-reported outcome measures offer a means of capturing patients’ experience of how 
their vision condition affects their daily life. These measures are commonly administered as 
questionnaires that can be used as a screening tool for visual impairment or as a functional 
outcome measure, and their application results in an enhanced communication between the 
patient and provider by uncovering aspects of vision and living that might otherwise would 
be ignored.
Despite the variety of clinical tests used to diagnose and monitor IRDs, researchers and 
clinicians still struggle to relate the results of clinical tests to a patient’s experience. Here we 
will highlight three prominent challenges facing reliance on the results of current visual and 
retinal function tests in the IRD population.
First, each clinical test individually does not capture the breadth of visual dysfunction and 
there is no gold standard test that can fully characterize the impact an IRD has on a patient. 
As a result, physicians often order a large number of clinical tests for IRD patients. 
Although recommendations have been made for standardizing testing and outcome 
measures, patient burden from several hours of testing can be significant, and often the tests 
yield findings that fail to address domains that are relevant to their condition and its 
treatment( 13).
Second, clinical test results can be incongruent with what the patient is experiencing. For 
example, patients may report changes to their vision, yet their visual acuity shows no 
change. Further investigation and testing may help explain patient symptoms, as seen with 
contrast sensitivity testing in patients with Stargardt’s disease and normal visual acuity( 15). 
Ultimately, a patient’s quality of life should be the most important consideration in 
evaluating treatment efficacy, and thus PRO instruments have the potential to be the most 
comprehensive measure of a clinically meaningful treatment effect.
Third, the outcome of often-used tests such as visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, 
and electroretinography can show substantial test-retest variability in the IRD population( 8–
10)and some claim that these supposedly objective measures could be influenced by 
patients’ moods or feelings about their general health( 11, 16). This presents a challenge in 
interpreting and analyzing test results over time in IRD patients. In preparation for their 
clinical trials, groups have attempted to quantify the degree of variability in clinical tests for 
ABCA4 (12, 17), RS1(7), CHM (18), RPE65 (19) to inform the use of these data to define 
meaningful change beyond variability in these measures.
High quality PRO instruments are designed to offer reliable measures in their target 
population, which can mitigate the potentially inconsistent data obtained from clinical 
testing measures. In IRD gene therapy research, PRO tools have provided meaningful data to 
demonstrate treatment efficacy. In August 2017, published results of a Phase 3 trial of 
voretigene neparvovec (trade name: Luxterna) showed patient improvement in two non-Lacy et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptstandard outcome measures—results of a mobility task and a PRO instrument, the National 
Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) —that measures visual 
functioning in a variety of domains.( 20) In response to this report and previous findings, 
Luxturna was approved for treatment of RPE65-mediated IRD in December 2017( 21).
Current Status of PRO Tools in Gene Therapy Trials
Research to-date places a heavy reliance on a small number of tested and validated PRO 
questionnaires. While well-established instruments such as the NEI VFQ-25 are high-quality 
and valuable tools, they were not designed for use in IRD populations nor for gene therapy 
trials. As will be discussed further in this article, use of a PRO instrument as an outcome 
measure requires careful consideration of the appropriateness of a particular instrument for 
the target population.
Despite these issues, to our knowledge, the only validated PRO instrument that has been 
used in published gene therapy trials for IRDs is the NEI VFQ-25. Of the peer-reviewed 
publications of clinical trials in RPE65 , XLRS , and CHM ; three studies have included the 
NEI VFQ-25 as an outcome measure( 20, 22, 23). An additional three studies have 
anecdotally included patient commentary on the perceived changes in their vision from 
treatment ( 24–26). While patient interviews yield information on PROs, without 
standardizing the method of collecting patient experience and validating the questionnaire, 
the utility of patient commentaries is limited.
Of the 54 gene therapy trials listed in 2018 in the National Clinical Trials (NCT) database, 
17 note the use of a PRO instrument. Only 7 of these trials specify use of a questionnaire 
that has been validated for use in other conditions in the NCT listings (NEI VFQ-25, SF-36). 
We note that in ongoing clinical trials it is possible that not all information on the trial’s 
methods is publicly available.
While results from PROs are not required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval, they are highly recommended by the FDA to be incorporated in a clinical trial. 
They have been identified as valuable outcome measures in other fields such as intraocular 
lenses ( 27) and the FDA has produced guidelines for PRO tool development ( 28).
Published FDA guidelines highlight four properties for evaluation of a PRO as an outcome 
measure: validity, reliability, ability to detect change, and interpretability ( 28). This review 
will focus on the first three criteria. Validity (i.e. content-related, criterion-related, 
predictive) refers to the capacity of the PRO instrument to describe the trait it intends to 
measure. Reliability (i.e. test-retest, internal consistency, inter-interviewer reproducibility) 
describes the consistency of the measurements taken using the PRO instrument. The 
instruments’ ability to detect change (i.e. effect size, standard error) reflects the sensitivity of 
the test.
Inherited Retinal Dystrophy-Specific PRO Measures
Khadka, Senthil, and colleagues have evaluated the content, measurement, psychometric, 
and validation properties of the existing ophthalmologic questionnaires relative to FDA 
guidelines ( 29, 30). In their study of IRD PRO instruments, 11 IRD-specific PRO Lacy et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinstruments were identified (9 for retinitis pigmentosa, 1 for Stargardt’s disease, and 1 for 
Congenital Stationary Night Blindness) and few had been adequately validated. To our 
knowledge, these disease-specific PROs have not been incorporated into past or existing 
gene therapy trials. We will discuss the merits of each of the PRO instruments and discuss 
the limitations to their application in IRD gene therapy clinical trials.
Perceived Visual Function Questionnaire.— As mentioned earlier, clinical function 
tests may not always reflect a patient’s subjective experience. To address this concern, 
Lodha and colleagues developed a PRO instrument and compared PRO responses with 
visual acuity, visual field, and contrast sensitivity testing in patients with retinitis pigmentosa 
(RP) ( 2). They identified correlations between PRO items related to near vision with visual 
acuity and contrast sensitivity when these factors were combined (r=0.609). Similarly, they 
found a correlation between global vision items and combined visual field and visual acuity 
(r=0.545). This study is informative in its contribution to the understanding of the 
intersection of patient reports and clinical testing. However, the study gives little information 
regarding how PRO items were derived and psychometrically validated.
Activities of Daily Vision & Daily Task Performance Questionnaire.— Szlyk and 
colleagues have developed two PRO instruments designed to evaluate the functional tasks 
and activity limitations experienced by patients with RP ( 3, 31). The first PRO instrument 
they developed combined two existing questionnaires and added additional questions 
intended to be specific to RP-related difficulties ( 3). Using factor analysis, they categorized 
tasks into 6 categories and created a composite score. Additionally, their analysis generated 
a predictive model to evaluate the relative correlations of visual acuity, visual fields, and 
ERG to patient-reported functional abilities. Their findings suggest that acuity scores 
significantly correlated (p<0.01) with 28/33 PRO items (r=0.22–0.57), while 18/33 items 
correlated with V-4-e (r=0.20–0.47) and 23/33 with II-4-e (r=0.21–0.45) Goldmann visual 
field areas. ERG data added minimally to the correlation between PRO items and visual 
acuity and visual fields( 3). In a follow-up to their previous work, the group sought to 
evaluate how well patient perception of their functional abilities matched their actual 
functional ability ( 31). Using the Activities of Daily Vision questionnaire and adding 20 RP-
specific items identified by expert opinion, their results showed a significant correlation 
(p<0.01) between 29 of the 32 questionnaire items and a functional assessment by a low-
vision specialist (r=0.13–0.70). In addition, they observed significant correlations (p<0.01) 
between questionnaire domains (reading/mobility/peripheral detection) and logMAR visual 
acuity (r s=−0.55/−0.40/−0.38), visual field (r s=0.42/0.47/0.55), contrast sensitivity 
(rs=0.62/0.54/0.52) and ERG. While both studies are informative, the methods for 
generating PRO items using in-depth interviews with patients with IRDs and the extent to 
which the PROs were psychometrically validated are unclear.
Independent Mobility Questionnaire & Mobility Difficulties Questionnaire.—
Turano 1999 developed a PRO targeted to assess mobility in RP patients based on expert 
opinion and a literature review( 5). One hundred and forty-five patients completed the 
questionnaire but V A, VF, and contrast sensitivity data were available from only 32 patients. 
From these PRO data, they created a “person-measure” to describe the overall ability of the Lacy et al. Page 5
Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 February 26.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpatient. When comparing the clinical data, Turano et al reported that 57% of the variability 
in person-measure scores could be attributed to V A, contrast sensitivity, and VF converted to 
a functional retinal area. The strength of this PRO is the development process specifically 
addressing mobility in patients with RP as well as thorough psychometric analysis of the 
PRO data. The limitations of this PRO include its sole focus on mobility, its reliance on 
clinical testing that was performed in a small subpopulation of patients, and the lack of 
patient input in generating the questionnaire items. In a subsequent study, the group sought 
to examine how RP patients’ mobility varies under different lighting conditions( 6). 
Responses from 25 patients with RP on a 4-item questionnaire were significantly correlated 
with the walking speed of patients performing a mobility task when patients reported 
difficulty in more than one area (p<0.01). Furthermore, the group reported that contrast 
sensitivity and visual field extent accounted for 69% of the variance in walking speed. While 
short questionnaires provide certain advantages, this 4-item questionnaire was not validated 
and was limited to evaluating mobility in the context of varying lighting conditions.
Everyday Task Questionnaire.— In a continuation of their previous work, Lowe and 
Drasdo sought to broadly describe the patient experience with RP( 32). Forty-eight patients 
with RP were sent a 16-item questionnaire and Snellen chart via mail. Patients were asked to 
complete the questionnaire and record their V A at home. Through these responses, they 
collected information regarding common features of RP, however the small sample size, and 
lack of validation present challenges for further application.
Vision-Related Activity of Daily Living & Field Expander Questionnaire.— In the 
course of studying visual field expander aids, two different groups created PRO instruments 
to collect information on patient experience ( 33, 34). While both studies were performed in 
small populations (16 and 10 patients), the questions were adapted to their RP low-vision aid 
users. The small sample size, specific focus of the questions, lack of validation, and 
insufficient information given regarding the PRO questionnaire all limit the generalizability 
of these PROs for use in other studies.
Stargardt’s Macular Dystrophy Vision Questionnaire & Night Vision 
Questionnaire.— Apart from RP, only two PROs have been developed to target other 
IRDs. Miedziak et al studied 200 patients with Stargardt’s disease to better characterize the 
condition( 35). The group created a PRO tool based on existing instruments and patient input. 
While a strength of this PRO is its development in a large Stargardt’s population, applying 
this PRO to all other IRDs would be inappropriate. Additionally, the validation methods of 
this PRO instrument are unclear. In a study of 101 Congenital Stationary Night Blindness 
(CSNB) patients, Bijveld et al attempted to specifically address night vision and created a 
PRO instrument that was based on existing low luminance questionnaires with some 
additional questions( 1). While CSNB is an inherited retinal condition, the non-progressive 
nature of CSNB as well as the isolated symptom of night blindness are key distinguishers 
that limit the use of this PRO in a larger IRD population.Lacy et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptGuidelines for PRO Creation in IRD Gene Therapy Trials
Novel and existing PRO instruments used in clinical trials must be held to the same scientific 
standards as required for other outcome measures. Critically, the use of a particular PRO 
instrument must have demonstrated validity and reliability as well as appropriateness for its 
suggested application( 14). To-date, no clinical trials have used publicly available PRO tools 
intended for use in the IRD gene therapy trials.
Development for intended population.— First, it is critical that a PRO instrument used 
in an IRD clinical trial has sound psychometric properties when applied to the target 
population. As Patrick et al and FDA colleagues have highlighted, the basic psychometric 
features of a PRO instrument are its reliability, validity, and ability to detect change ( 28, 36). 
In order for the application of a PRO to be appropriate for a clinical trial, each of these 
instrument features must be tested and proven in the IRD population targeted for clinical 
trials. The PRO should be developed for application to patients with a diagnosed retinal 
dystrophy who meet the eligibility criteria of the clinical trial (i.e. appropriate visual acuity, 
visual field, and ERG). While IRD clinical trials are largely enrolled based on identified 
pathogenic variants of genes (i.e. RPE65 , ABCA4 , etc.), given the similarity in clinical 
characteristics across many IRDs, we consider it appropriate to develop a PRO instrument in 
a non-gene specific IRD population first. As we gain further insight on these conditions—
e.g., defined by genotype--and their responses to treatment, developing genotype-specific 
IRD PRO instruments may be warranted. At this time, a comprehensive PRO measure that 
evaluates all domains of visual dysfunction causing limitations, validated in a general IRD 
population (i.e. non gene-specific) has the greatest utility.
Notably, many IRD clinical trials are conducted in children which presents additional 
challenges to the validity and reliability of these measures. Items addressed in a PRO must 
be comprehendible and relevant to the development level of the population.
Patient input.— The basis for generating applicable content and items in a PRO instrument 
is patient input. Patrick and colleagues have detailed the appropriate methodology for 
collecting and analyzing the qualitative data generated from patient input ( 37, 38). This 
involves a series of in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients to capture their 
perceptions of how their vision relates to basic domains of their daily life (e.g., functioning, 
emotional, social) with a series of open-ended questions. These interviews are qualitatively 
analyzed, and items are identified and sifted by software such as Atlas TI (Version 8.1.3 
(522) Atlas.ti, Germany) . Based on identification of recurrent items, common themes and 
points of emphasis (items), along with obtaining guidance from a panel of experts in the 
field (retinal specialists, genetic counselors, occupational therapists, electrophysiologists, for 
example), a set of questions are developed that are designed to address all of the domains in 
a relevant, understandable, and comprehensive manner.
From this, specific PRO items can be generated to target the identified patient symptoms and 
experiences. After these items are drafted, researchers must solicit more feedback from 
patients in the form of a cognitive interview to ensure the items clearly and consistently 
capture their intended concepts. As emphasized by Patrick et al, expert opinion is not a Lacy et al. Page 7
Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 February 26.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsubstitute for this process of direct patient input in establishing content validity of an 
instrument ( 36).
While many PROs are not validated in patients with severely limited vision, questions must 
be targeted and relevant to the low-vision IRD population. As these conditions are 
congenital and slowly progressing, patients may have lived with poor vision and/or subtle 
visual decline their entire life. Therefore, some common activities and experiences included 
in existing PRO instruments may not be relevant; for example, questions related to driving a 
car. Patient input is the only method of generating items that are targeting meaningful patient 
experiences and activities. For these reasons, we highly encourage patient involvement in the 
early development of content and questions via the in-depth and cognitive interview methods 
described in FDA guidelines and supporting literature( 28, 37, 38).
Psychometric evaluation.— After the PRO instrument has been administered to a large 
sample of patients, statistical analysis must be performed on the collected data. FDA 
guidelines do not specify the methodology of statistical evaluation. However, internal 
consistency, test-retest reliability and the ability to detect change (responsiveness) are noted 
as critical items to address in a novel PRO instrument ( 28, 36). Given that IRDs are slowly 
progressing, patient reports should yield consistent findings over short time intervals (i.e. 
two weeks). The measure must elicit reproducible responses from patients and can be tested 
directly by repeat administration of the PRO instrument to a subset of patients to ensure 
reliability. We encourage careful consideration of this concept when designing a PRO for 
children as consistency in responses may be a particular concern.
The ability of a PRO instrument to detect change might be a particular challenge in 
developing a PRO for the IRD gene therapy population. While many gene therapy trial 
candidates may have very limited vision, floor effects in the distribution of PRO data raise 
substantial concerns. PRO items must be able to generate results that detect the subtle 
differences in ability and/or experience from person to person. Capturing such subtle 
differences requires careful thought in designing a response scale or metric for each intended 
question. The responses must have sensitivity to the rate and manner that IRD patients 
experience vision loss. When examining the same patient over time, the PRO instrument 
must be sensitive to change in both natural disease progression as well as sensitive enough to 
detect a possible treatment effect of improved visual function.
PRO statistical analysis conducted using factor analysis methods have been described as 
yielding first-generation instruments ( 39). Some have advocated the creation of second-
generation instruments that are based on applying Rasch validation techniques ( 39, 40). The 
FDA does not advocate for the use of a particular statistical method to use in its guidelines.
Conclusion
With the proliferation of gene therapy trials that are intended for regulatory approval, use of 
validated PRO instruments for IRD-specific populations is imperative to fully understand 
treatment efficacy. To our knowledge, there is currently no PRO instrument developed for 
and validated in the population of potential IRD gene therapy candidates. We assert that such Lacy et al. Page 8

information for patients and researchers.
