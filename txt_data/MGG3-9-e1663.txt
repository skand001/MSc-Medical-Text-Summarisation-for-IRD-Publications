1 | INTRODUCTION
Inherited retinal diseases (IRD) are a genetically heteroge-
neous group of conditions, the majority of which are cur -
rently untreatable. In England and Wales, IRD have now 
overtaken diabetic retinopathy as the most prevalent cause of sight impairment registration in working- age adults, and 
are the second most common cause of sight loss in childhood 
(Liew et al., 2014; Rahi & Cable, 2003).
Managing patients with rare diseases requires specific exper -
tise, which often includes access to diagnostic genetic testing, a 
field that has rapidly evolved over the past decade. While a range Received: 13 April 2020 | Revised: 19 January 2021 | Accepted: 10 February 2021

Background: This case series reports the performance of a next- generation sequencing 
(NGS) panel of 176 retinal genes (NGS 176) in patients with inherited retinal disease (IRD).
Methods: Subjects are patients who underwent genetic testing between 1 August 
2016 and 1 January 2018 at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK. Panel- based 
 genetic testing was performed unless a specific gene (e.g., RS1) or small group of 
genes (e.g., ABCA4, PRPH2) were suspected. If a novel variant was identified, a 
further comment on their predicted pathogenicity and evolutionary conservation was 
offered and segregation studies performed. The main outcome measure is the likeli-
hood of obtaining a genetic diagnosis using NGS 176.
Results: 488 patients were included. A molecular diagnosis was obtained for 59.4% 
of patients. Younger patients were more likely to receive a molecular diagnosis; with 
92% of children under the age of 6 years receiving a conclusive result. There was a 
change in their initially assigned inheritance pattern in 8.4% of patients following 
genetic testing. Selected IRD diagnoses (e.g., achromatopsia, congenital stationary 
night blindness) were associated with high diagnostic yields.
Conclusion: This study confirms that NGS 176 is a useful first- tier genetic test for 
most IRD patients. Age and initial clinical diagnosis were strongly associated with 
diagnostic yield.2 of 9 |

of techniques is now available, the optimal method of testing is yet 
to be established. For IRDs with a strong genotype- to- phenotype 
correlation, Sanger sequencing of single genes (e.g., PAX6, RS1, 
CHM , KCNV2, recessive NR2E3) or even single amplicons (e.g., 
EFEMP1:c.1033C>T, p.(Arg345Trp); C1QTNF5:c.489C>A, 
p.(Ser163Arg); m.3243a>g) may be the most cost- effective ap-
proach. For others, such as patients presenting with the classical 
features of rod- cone dystrophy (retinitis pigmentosa), pathogenic 
variants in any one of over 100 different genes could be disease-  
causing, and consequently, a less focussed approach may be 
advantageous. Such techniques may involve either targeted cap-
ture and then resequencing of genomic regions known to harbor 
IRD genes, or more recently, whole exome or whole genome 
sequencing, typically followed by the bioinformatic masking of 
non- IRD causing genes (to minimize the detection of “inciden-
tal findings”). Whichever technique is used, once sequencing 
of IRD genes has taken place, interpreting the significance of 
detected variants is the next challenge, often necessitating a mul-
tidisciplinary team approach.
Despite these challenges, genetic testing is highly valued 
by patients and clinicians, primarily as it helps to provide 
an accurate diagnosis, and consequently, inform prognosis 
(Broadgate et al., 2017). Clinical management may also be 
directly influenced (renal disease, SCA7, CLN3) (Ellingford 
et al., 2015; Hamel, 2007), and in a minority of cases treat-
ment initiated (e.g., adult Refsum disease and gyrate atrophy) 
(Orphanet: Gyrate atrophy of choroid & retina; Orphanet: 
Refsum disease), which, for recessive RPE65- associated IRD, 
may now involve gene- replacement therapy (Office of the 
Commissioner Press Announcements; Russell et al., 2017). 
Achieving a confirmed molecular diagnosis opens the possi-
bility to be involved in the treatment trial, and so far there are 
active gene therapy trials on RPGR, CHM, MERTK, RS1, and 
PDE6B (Home -  ClinicalTrials.gov). Apart from gene ther -
apy, novel pharmacotherapy (e.g., C20- deuterated vitamin 
A for ABCA4 disease, neuroprotection, optogenetic therapy, 
stem cell therapy, and retinal prosthesis are all under various 
stages of development, and most of these would require a clear 
molecular diagnosis as a prerequisite for inclusion in clinical 
trials (Scholl et al., 2016). Last, a molecular diagnosis enables 
accurate counseling regarding the disease recurrence risk, as 
well as access to pre- natal interventions (Brezina et al., 2012).
In previous work, we have described our experience using 
a 105 gene panel (Khan et al., 2017), which provided a con-
clusive molecular diagnosis for 39% of our patients with 
IRD. The present work now reports our experience of genetic 
testing, in a similar cohort of patients, using the next iteration 
of this test, which now screens 176 genes (NGS 176).
2 | SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The methods in this study are similar to our previous pub-
lication (Khan et al., 2017). Briefly, the results of all NGS 176 tests received between 1 August 2016 and 1 January 
2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had been 
diagnosed with an IRD by one of the three experienced 
clinicians (A. T. M., A. R. W., M. M.) at Moorfields Eye 
Hospital, London, UK. Where a specific gene (e.g., RS1), or 
small group of genes were suspected (e.g., ABCA4, PRPH2), 
patients were not subjected to the full 176 gene screen, and 
a molecular diagnosis was obtained by focused exome se-
quencing of 10 genes known to cause macular dystrophy 
(Stargardt/Macular dystrophy panel v3, Casey Eye Institute 
Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory). Similarly, when X- 
linked rod- cone dystrophy or choroideremia was suspected, 
single- gene sequencing was performed (ORF15 of RPGR, 
exons 114 RPGR, RP2, and CHM, respectively) (National 
Genetics Reference Laboratory, Manchester Center for 
Genomic Medicine). Patients with albinism, isolated foveal 
hypoplasia, and inherited optic neuropathies were typically 
investigated using alternative pathways. However, retinal 
dystrophies occurring as a part of syndromic diagnosis were 
included.
The following patient demographics were extracted from 
the hospital electronic medical records (OpenEyes): age at 
the time of genetic testing, ethnicity, clinical diagnosis, and 
suspected mode of inheritance (when commented upon).
2.1 | Genetic testing
A custom- designed (Retinal dystrophy v3) Sure Select Target 
Enrichment Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was 
used for targeted enrichment of 176 genes and immediate 
splice sites ±5 bases known to be mutated in patients with 
isolated and syndromic retinal disease (Manchester Centre 
for Genomic Medicine). The samples were sequenced using a 
HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's proto-
cols. Sequence data were aligned to the hg19 human genome 
using BWA- MEM v0.6.2 and abra v0.96. Variant calling 
was completed using Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK- 
lite v2.0.39) (SNVs and indels), Pindel v0.2.4t (large indels), 
and DECoN v1.0.1 (copy number variation). Using this ap-
proach, sequencing data from 99.5% of all coding exons 
from 176 genes are obtained, with a minimum accepted read 
depth of 50X. The testing laboratory (Manchester Center for 
Genomic Medicine, Manchester UK) then issues a clinical 
report detailing variants thought to account for the disease. 
If a novel variant is identified, a further comment as to the 
predicted pathogenicity and evolutionary conservation was 
also offered and segregation studies performed.
2.2 | Statistical analysis
Statistical testing was performed using Python (Welcome to 
Python.org), ResearchPy (Bryant, 2020), and Statsmodels    | 3 of 9
SHECK Et al.
(StatsModels: Statistics in Python —  statsmodels 0.9.0 doc-
umentation). The chance of achieving a confirmed genetic 
diagnosis was assessed by univariate analysis. Continuous 
variables were analyzed using Student's T  test, and cat-
egorical variables were analyzed using a Chi- squared test. 
Logistic regression was used to model the interactions be-
tween the independent variables (age, sex, initial clinical 
diagnosis, suspected inheritance pattern, ethnicity) and the 
outcome of achieving a confirmed genetic diagnosis. The 
Wald test was used to assess the significance of the inter-
action at the overall variable level. If this was found to be 
statistically significant, further analysis was performed for 
individual categories within the variable to determine the 
odds ratio, and p- values returned within the logistic regres-
sion model. A result was deemed statistically significant if 
its p- value was less than 0.05.
3 | RESULTS
Genetic results for 488 patients were received between 1 
August 2016 and 1 January 2018. The mean age of the tested 
patients was 38 years, with a range of 0– 88 years. Detailed 
demographic data are presented in Table 1.
The results of genetic testing were categorized as fol-
lows: (a) testing established a conclusive molecular diagnosis 
in regard to the genotype of the patient (all/sufficient likely 
disease- causing alleles were identified), (b) testing was incon-
clusive in regard to the genotype of the patient (not all disease-  
causing alleles were identified/only variants of uncertain 
significance were detected), and (c) no pathogenic variants 
thought to account for the phenotype were identified in the 
patient concerned. Table 2 shows the findings after NGS 176 
in these patients. Overall, a conclusive molecular diagnosis 
was possible for 59.4% of the study cohort (Table 1).
We then explored the influence of patient age at the 
time of testing on the likelihood of obtaining a conclusive molecular diagnosis. We defined diagnostic yield as the pro-
portion of patients with a conclusive molecular diagnosis in 
that category. Figure 1 plots the diagnostic yield of the NGS 
176 panel for patients at any given age. For patients aged 6 or 
less, a positive result was obtained for 91.8%. This reduced 
to 72.0% for all patients under the age of 35. The diagnos-
tic yield continued to decline with increasing age. These 
results are highly statistically significant on both univariate 
(p  =  1.22E- 07) and multivariate analysis (p  =  1.29E- 06) 
(Tables 3 and 4).
We then investigated whether the prevalence of null alleles 
(variants that are predicted to either directly or indirectly re-
sult in a premature termination codon) differed according to 
patient age at testing. The results are presented in Table 5; we 
did not detect a difference in age between patients carrying 
(single/double) null and missense only alleles.
We then examined whether the diagnostic yield varied ac-
cording to patients’ initial clinical diagnosis. Table 2 presents 
these data, and Tables 3 and 4 the corresponding statistical 
analysis. Patients diagnosed with congenital stationary night 
blindness (CSNB; based on normal retinal structure and ab-
normal electroretinography), were most likely to receive a 
definitive molecular diagnosis (93.8%), followed by patients 
diagnosed with a stationary or progressive cone disorder 
(80%). This high diagnostic yield in disorders of cone func-
tion is partly due to a 100% diagnostic yield for patients with 
achromatopsia. Individuals with either a rod- cone or cone- rod 
dystrophy had a similar diagnostic yield (56.7% and 60.9%). 
While patients diagnosed with a (not further classified) “ret-
inal dystrophy” had less chance of receiving a molecular 
diagnosis (48.7%). In this cohort, only 37% of patients diag-
nosed with macular dystrophy received a conclusive genetic 
diagnosis. The relationship between initial clinical diagnosis 
and diagnostic yield was statistically significant in both uni-
variate (p = 0.0002) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.0023). 
The specific diagnoses of macular dystrophy and undefined 
retinal dystrophy have a lower odds ratio in diagnostic yield 
comparing to rod- cone dystrophy (macular dystrophy odds 
ratio 0.35, p- value 0.016; undefined retinal dystrophy odds 
ratio 0.51, p- value 0.022).
The influence of the mode of inheritance on diagnostic 
yield was also explored. These data are presented in Table 6. 
Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance was proposed when 
multiple generations were affected, without a history of 
consanguinity. X- chromosome linked (XL) disease was sug-
gested when male family members were consistently more 
severely affected than females, with no male- to- male inher -
itance. Autosomal recessive (AR) disease was considered 
most likely in consanguineous or endogamous pedigrees, or 
in simplex cases when both parents were unaffected. In this 
cohort, patients suspected to have an AR disease appeared 
to be less likely to receive a conclusive molecular diagno-
sis compared to patients predicted to segregate an XL or AD TABLE 1 Demographic data and result of genetic testing using

condition (Table 7); although this did not reach statistical 
significance on both univariate and multivariate analyses. 
Molecular genetic testing corrected the suspected mode of 
inheritance in 8.4% of patients. Of particular relevance to 
genetic counseling, 20% of patients thought to have an XL 
condition had an alternative pattern of inheritance (13% AD, 
6.7% AR), and for 9.1% of patients suspected to have AR dis-
ease this too was incorrect (6.7% cases were reassigned AD, 
2.4% of cases were, in fact, XL, all these cases are de novo 
cases with both parents unaffected).
In this study, the most prevalent genetic cause of AR IRD 
were disease- causing variants in USH2A (n  =  37, 9.8% of 
all autosomal recessive or simplex cases). Variants in RP1 
were the most common cause of autosomal dominant dis-
ease (n = 19, 31.7%). Here, pathogenic variants in CNGB3 were the most common cause of achromatopsia (ACHM), 
and variants in CACNA1F were the most prevalent cause of 
CSNB. Table S1 provides a more detailed analysis.
4 | DISCUSSION
The use of phenotype- based gene panel testing facilitates 
the rapid interpretation of targeted capture, whole- exome, 
and whole- genome sequencing (WGS) data, thus offering 
great clinical utility (Broadgate et al., 2017). The devel-
opment of these panels is iterative and evolves based on 
contemporary knowledge. The present study analyses the 
performance of the latest molecular test (NGS 176) used 
in the UK National Health Service to screen for IRD, re-
porting a diagnostic yield of 59%. This out- performed the 
previous gene screen from the same laboratory (NGS 105), 
which had a yield of 39% under similar testing conditions 
(Khan et al., 2017). As patients presenting with a clearly 
recognizable macular dystrophy phenotype (including 
those associated with variants in ABCA4, PRPH2, RS1, 
BEST1) and X- linked rod- cone dystrophy/Choroideremia 
(RPGR, RP2, CHM) were investigated by alternative path-
ways, the diagnostic yield of NGS176 for all patients with 
IRD is likely to be significantly higher than we report. 
Despite this, the yield of 59% compares favorably with 
other international IRD cohorts— 57.6% (Stone et al in a 
tiered approach without exome / genome sequencing) and 
50% (Ellingford et al using a 105 gene panel, similar to our 
previous study) (Ellingford et al., 2016; Stone et al., 2017).
Molecular testing, especially for genetically heteroge-
neous conditions such as IRD, may be expected to have a 
diagnostic yield of less than 100% for a number of reasons, TABLE 2 Clinical diagnosis of patients in this study and the associated NGS 176 gene panel diagnostic yield

which may be broadly categorized as follows: (a) the caus-
ative genetic locus may not be included in the testing panel 
(eg DRAM2, RAX2— both recently reported novel causes of 
IRD that were unknown at the time of NGS 176 panel design, 
or CHM : chrX: 85,220,593T>C (ENST00000357749.2;

insufficient genetic data available after sequencing a known 
disease- causing locus due to its inherent complexity (e.g., 
ORF15 of RPGR); or (c) current genetic analysis is not so-
phisticated enough to interpret the sequencing data accu-
rately (mapping of sequence reads for the X- chromosome TABLE 3 Univariate analysis on the correlation between diagnostic yield, and age, sex, ethnicity, suspected inheritance pattern, and clinical

Opsin array, detection of medium- sized indels or complex 
structural variants, interpreting the clinical significance of 
detected exonic or intronic variants). A range of different 
techniques are being used to address each of these issues, one 
of which involves sequencing additional genetic loci. These 
now include both exonic and intronic regions, and some IRD 
panels now including up to 875 genes (Retinal Dystrophy 
Xpanded panel, GeneDx). Although “physical” gene panels 
are updated infrequently, primarily due to the time and cost 
involved, bioinformatic refreshing of “virtual” gene panels is 
far more efficient. This approach is becoming increasingly 
prevalent as the price of whole- exome and whole- genome 
sequencing falls. In addition, novel techniques, such as long- 
read sequencing, now enable repetitive and GC- rich genomic 
regions to be interrogated in an unbiased manner, facilitating 
the detection of hitherto elusive variants (Mizuguchi et al., 
2019). Using these approaches, the uplift in diagnostic yield 
has been suggested to be in the range of 18– 20% by one group (Stone et al., 2017), and 29% by another (Ellingford 
et al., 2016). Carss et al. report a more conservative detection 
rate of 55% in a cohort of 605 patients analyzed using WGS 
(Carss et al., 2017). As the cost of sequencing falls, other 
steps in the genetic testing pipeline replace financing as the 
next significant challenge to overcome; these include sam-
ple handling, quality control, bioinformatic analysis, report 
writing, segregation studies, and delivering accurate genetic 
counseling.
In this study, age was highly correlated with the likelihood 
of obtaining a genetic diagnosis. Although the age at which 
patients first developed symptoms could not be accurately 
ascertained, we recorded age at the time of genetic testing 
as a surrogate marker for this, accepting its inherent limita-
tions. Genetic testing in children with IRD had a significantly 
higher success rate than when the same test was performed 
in older adults, an important consideration when perform-
ing pretest counseling. A number of explanations for this TABLE 4 Multivariate analysis of the correlation between diagnostic yield, and age, sex, ethnicity, suspected inheritance pattern and clinical

observation may exist. First, congenital or early- onset IRD 
represent major departures from normal physiology, which 
we would expect to be mediated by a rare genetic variant of 
high impact. In contrast, conditions with an adult- onset, sug-
gest a process that is likely to have taken two or more decades 
to develop, and consequently result from less penetrant al-
leles. These variants may, therefore, be under less selective 
pressure, and so be more prevalent than those associated with 
childhood- onset disease. This is perhaps best exemplified by 
disease- causing variants in ABCA4, where those associated 
with childhood- onset autosomal recessive Stargardt disease 
(STGD1) usually function as null alleles and are rare, while 
those associated with late- onset STGD1 are often hypomor -
phic, have a greater prevalence in the general population, 
and so are less readily identifiable using current bioinfor -
matics analysis (Fujinami et al., 2015). As a result, it is not 
uncommon for genetic testing to only identify one of the 
two disease- causing ABCA4 variants in cases of adult- onset 
STGD1, a situation that rarely occurs in childhood- onset 
cases (Fujinami et al., 2015). Second, the functional conse-
quences of a variant are also likely to relate to their genomic 
position, with exonic, non- synonymous variants predicted 
to be of larger effect size, overall, compared to variants in 
non- protein- coding regions; however, this is not always 
the case. Notable exceptions relevant to IRD include vari-
ants in the non- coding region upstream to PRDM13 associ-
ated with North Carolina Macular Dystrophy (Small et al., 2016) (OMIM 13650) and CEP290:c.2991+1655A>G, a 
prevalent cause of LCA in European patients (Sheck et al., 
2018). Typically, exonic variants are easier to detect and their 
significance easier to interpret, and so current pipelines are 
optimized to detect these variants that may be of greater bio-
logical significance. In a pooled analysis we were not able to 
detect a difference in age between patients with one/multiple 
null alleles versus those with only missense variants. Reasons 
for this may include (a) the effect of missense alleles being 
hard to discern and many, may in fact function as null alleles; 
(b) significant genotype- specific data being lost in a pooled 
analysis (e.g., for CACNA1F); and (c) the exclusion of spe-
cific genotypes that were investigated using alternative path-
ways (e.g., ABCA4). Last, it is also possible that a number 
of patients diagnosed with late- onset IRD may in fact have 
an acquired disorder mimicking IRD. Known phenocopies 
of IRD include some forms of inflammatory retinal dis-
ease (uveitis), toxic retinopathies (e.g., that associated with 
hydroxychloroquine or pentosan polysulfate use), and auto-
immune retinopathies (Gregory- Evans et al., 2018). If this 
cohort of typically older patients were erroneously offered 
genetic testing, a lower yield would be expected.
In addition to age, the clinical diagnosis was found to be 
significantly associated with diagnostic yield after multivar -
iate analysis (Tables 3 and 4). The most genetically homoge-
neous IRD phenotypes, ACHM and CSNB, associated with 6 
and 10 genes, respectively, had the highest diagnostic yield, 
100% and 94%, while more heterogeneous subgroups (rod- 
cone dystrophy associated with >100 genes) had much lower 
yields (61% overall). Genetic testing was least informative 
for less well- classified cases (here termed retinal dystrophy 
and vitreoretinopathy) (Table 6), suggesting that either the 
clinical diagnosis of IRD may have been questionable, that 
the disorder may not be inherited as a Mendelian trait, or, if 
monogenic, that the causative variant resides in a genomic 
locus that is currently poorly understood or not represented 
on the 176 gene panel. Within the largest IRD subgroup, 
those with rod- cone dystrophy, the youngest patients were 
more likely to receive a conclusive result from genetic testing 
(82%) when compared with the oldest patients tested (57%). 
It is likely that the low diagnostic yield for patients with mac-
ular dystrophy is a result of the genetic testing algorithm used 
here, as patients with phenotypic clues as to their genotype TABLE 6 suspected inheritance pattern based on the clinical data of patients in this study and the associated NGS 176 gene panel diagnostic

Over time, the preferred technique for genetic testing has 
evolved, and in the United Kingdom, at least for patients with 
rare disease and cancer, the future promises increased access 
to WGS (The 100,000 Genomes Project). However, short- 
term panel testing will remain the principal option for IRD 
screening in the United Kingdom— partly due to cost consid-
erations but also due to the high diagnostic yield illustrated 
in this report. While WGS will mitigate against some of the 
technical causes for loss in diagnostic yield observed in this 
study, it brings with it its own significant challenges (Stone 
et al., 2017). A phenotype- based gene panel approach to in-
terpreting WGS data is likely to offer great clinical utility, 
with limited off- target effects. Sharing detailed knowledge 
of rare variants will become increasingly important, and de-
positing these data in publically accessible repositories will 
facilitate patient care worldwide. This work serves to high-
lights how effective current genetic testing in the NHS is, and 
how it can be used to care for 1 in 2– 3,000 patients with IRD 
(Hartong et al., 2006).
