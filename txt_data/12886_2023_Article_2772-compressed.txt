Thicknesses of the retina and choroid 
in children with retinitis pigmentosa
Cheng  Li, Chunxia  Peng, Chengyue  Zhang  and Ningdong  Li* 
Abstract  
Purpose  To compare the retinal thicknesses (RT) and choroidal thicknesses (CT) in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) children 
with those of health
y children using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) optical coherence tomography (OCT). The RT and 
CT in different genetic subgroups of autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) and X-linked inheritance RP (XLRP) were further 
studied to investigate the characteristics of retinal and choroidal changes in the early stages of RP .
Method  A retr
ospective analysis was performed on a group of patients with RP who underwent EDI-OCT. Thirty-two 
children (64 eyes) with RP and 28 age- and refraction-matched healthy children (56 eyes) were included in the study. 
Seven of the 32 RP children (14 eyes) had X-linked inheritance RP , and 10 (20 eyes) had autosomal dominant inherit-
ance RP . RT and CT were measured by optical coherence tomography and compared between the 32 children with 
RP and 28 controls and between 7 XLRP and 10 ADRP children.
Result  Among the 32 children with RP
, there were 18 males and 14 females with an average age of 6.6  ± 2.4 y
ears. 
The mean RT was smaller in the RP group than in the control group at all of the locations. The mean temporal CT was 
smaller in the RP group (243.76  ± 60.82  μm) than in the control g
roup (275.23  ± 40.92  μm) 
(P = 0.001), while there was 
no sig
nificant thinning on the foveal or nasal side.
The best-corrected visual acuity of the XLRP group (0.40  ± 0.19) was worse than that of the ADRP g
roup (0.68  ± 0.21) 
(
P = 0.001), but the disease duration was the same (P  = 0.685). T
he mean foveal RT was smaller in the XLRP group 
(173.85  ± 22.87  μm) than in the ADRP gr
oup (192.20  ± 9.70 μm) 
(P = 0.003), while there was no sig
nificant thinning at 
the other locations we studied. The mean temporal CT was smaller in the XLRP group (211.21  ± 69.41  μm) than in the 
ADRP gr
oup (274.45  ± 57.91  μm) 
(P = 0.007); CT measur
ements in XLRP children showed a more severe reduction on 
the temporal side.
Conclusion  The chor
oid in RP children was preferentially smaller on the temporal side of the macula, and retinal 
thinning was relatively extensive. Children with RP have strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The XLRP children 
demonstrated greater RT reduction at the fovea and greater CT reduction at the temporal side of the macula than the 
ADRP children. Our findings also provide evidence that the changes in thicknesses may be indicative of the greater 
severity of XLRP versus ADRP in the early stage.

Introduction
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inheritable retinal disor -
der with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4000  ~ 5000 in t he 
global population [1 ]. It can be inherited in an autosomal 
dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), X-linked (XL), 
or digenic pattern [2 ]. Night blindness usually presents as an *Correspondence:

early symptom of RP , followed by a progressive contraction 
of the peripheral visual field. The patient’s central vision may 
be preserved in the early stage but will decrease over time, 
ultimately resulting in complete blindness when cone cell 
function is lost entirely. Fundus changes are typically char -
acterized as a waxy pallor of the optic disc with narrowing 
of re
tinal blood vessels and formation of bone spicule–like 
pigment deposits at the mid-periphery of the retina. The 
electrophysiological response of the patient’s retina in an 
electroretinogram (ERG) may be diminished or absent.
RP has strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity, with 
diverse inheritance patterns, disease-causing genes and 
clinical features. The expressivity of the causative genes is 
variable among patients with different inheritance patterns 
and different gene mutations. In the early stage of RP , visual 
impairment is believed to be milder in AD patients, who 
have a relatively late onset of illness and retain their central 
vision into adulthood, than in XL patients, who have a more 
severe disease course, especially for affected males [3 ].
Although RP is caused by mutations in many genes, the 
final pathway of pathological change is apoptosis of the 
photoreceptor cells (PRC) and the retinal pigment epithe -
lium (RPE). The PRC and RPE atrophy due to loss of cells 
as t
he disease progresses; this degradation ultimately leads 
to structural changes in the whole retina. The choroid 
lies adjacent to the retina and supplies it with abundant 
oxygen, blood and nutrients to meet the high metabolic 
demands of the PRC and RPE. When the retina undergoes 
structural changes, the choroid, which is entirely com -
posed of vascular tissue, may be involved in retinal ves -
sel narrowing. In this study, we evaluated the anatomical 
change
s in the retina and choroid in patients with autoso -
mal dominant RP (ADRP) and X-linked RP (XLRP).
Materials and methods
Participants
We conducted a retrospective study including thirty-two chil -
dren (64 eyes) with RP and 28 age- and refraction-matched healt
hy children (56 eyes). Patients with XLRP and ADRP 
who were under 12  years 
of age were recruited for this study. 
The diagnosis of RP was based on the following criteria: (1) 
reduction or extinction of electrophysiological responses 
recorded in an ERG; and (2) typical fundus changes on reti -
noscopic examination. Children in the healthy control group 
had no e ye di
seases except for some refractive errors. Patients 
were divided into the XLRP and ADRP groups according 
to their disease-causing genes. The duration of symptoms 
and onset age of XLRP and ADRP were matched (shown in 
Table  1). All participants underwent ophthalmologic exami -
nations, including evaluations of best-corrected visual acuity 
using Sne
llen charts, slit-lamp examination of the anterior 
segment of each eye, and examination of the vitreous and 
fundus by ophthalmoscopy and photography [4 ]. Refractive 
error was examined using a Welch Allyn VS100 apparatus. 
Full-field ERGs were recorded using the RETI-scan 21 sys -
tem (Roland company, Germany) according to the standards 
of the In
ternational Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of 
Vision (http://  w
ww. i
scev.  or
g).
Patients were excluded if they had myopia of more 
than 6 dioptres (D), hyperopia higher than 3 D, astig -
matism higher than 3 D, cataracts, macular oedema 
or e pir
etinal membrane, because these factors might 
interfere with the accurate measurement of the reti -
nal and choroidal thicknesses [5 ]. Thi s st udy complied 
with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Beijing Chil -
dren’s Hospital.
OCT examinations
OCT measurements were obtained using a Spectralis 
OCT apparatus with a wavelength of 870  nm (Heide
l-
berg Engineering GmbH, Germany) in enhanced depth 
imag ing (E
DI) acquisition mode. One section through 
the macular fovea and the optic disc, composed of 100 
averaged scans, was obtained. All children were sched -
uled for examination in the afternoon. A horizontal

high-resolution line scan passing through the fovea in 
primary gaze was chosen for detailed analysis. The thick -
nesses of the retina and choroid were measured manu -
ally using the calliper function in the Heidelberg reader 
sof
tware [6]. The retinal thickness (RT) was measured 
between the inner limiting membrane and the outer 
border of the RPE, and thickness measurements were 
obtained at the fovea and at 1000  μm and 3000  μm nasal 
and t
emporal to the centre of the fovea in a horizontal 
section [7]. The choroid thickness (CT) was measured 
from the outer border of the RPE vertically to the inner 
scleral border at the fovea and at 1000  μm and 3000  μm 
nasal 
and temporal to the centre of the fovea in a hori -
zontal section (shown in Fig.  1) [ 8]. Both the RT and CT 
were measured by the same experienced physician; the 
measurements were repeated three times and averaged.Molecular diagnosis
Three millilitres of peripheral venous blood was col -
lected from the patients and their matched control par -
ticipants. The patient’s DNA was extracted from the 
lym
phocytes according to a standard protocol (Roche 
Biochemical, Inc.). Exome sequencing was performed 
by the commercial Myogenomic Company (Beijing, 
China). Sequences were analysed using the Seqman 
program in DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc., Mad -
ison, WI). The online tools Polyphen-2 and SIFT were 
us
ed to predict the possible impact on the structure 
and function of a protein after an amino acid substitu -
tion. Mutations were named following the nomencla -
ture recommended by the Human Genomic Variation 
So
ciety (HGVS). According to the ACMG criteria, the 
gene variants in our study were pathogenic.

Statistics
The retinal and choroidal thicknesses were compared 
between different groups. Statistical analysis was per -
formed using a statistical software package (SPSS, ver -
sion 23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Frequency and 
des
criptive statistics were used for data analysis. Demo -
graphic and clinical characteristics, including age, CT 
and R T
, were compared using independent sample t 
tests. All the data were normally distributed, and sex 
was compared using the chi-squared test. Differences 
were considered significant if p  < 0.05.
Results
Sixty-four eyes of 32 children with RP (18 males and 14 
females) and 56 eyes of 28 healthy controls (15 males 
and 13 females) were included in the study. A flowchart 
of patient recruitment is shown in Fig.  2. There was no 
significant difference in age, sex, or spherical equivalent 
between the RP and control groups (shown in Table  1). 
Fourteen eyes of 7 children with X-linked inheritance 
(5 males and 2 females) and 20 eyes of 10 children with 
autosomal dominant inheritance (6 males and 4 females) 
were included in the study and allocated to the XLRP and 
ADRP groups, respectively (Table 1).
There were significant differences in the RT between 
the RP group and the control group (p  = 0.000) at all 
of t
he measured points (Table  2). In the RP group, the 
mean CT 3000  μm to t
he temporal side of the fovea was 
243.76  ± 60.82  μm, while the c
orresponding measure -
ment in the control group was 275.23  ± 40.92  μm; this 
difference was significant (p  < 0.05; show
n in Table  3). There was no significant thinning in the other locations 
we studied. We found that the CT measurements of RP 
children showed a more severe reduction on the tempo -
ral side. Macular thicknesses and sub-macular CT of the 
RP g
roup and the control group were presented in Fig.3.
The mean RT of the XLRP and ADRP group are pre -
sented in Table  2. Ther e were significant differences in 
the foveal RT between the two groups (p  = 0.003). 
The 
foveal RT of XLRP patients was less than that of ADRP 
patients (Fig.3), but there was no significant differ -
ence at 1000  μm or 3000  μm fr om the fovea. We found 
that retinal degeneration at the macula was more obvi -
ous in children with XLRP than in children with ADRP . 
The mac ul
ar thicknesses were positively correlated with 
BCVA in XLRP and ADRP respectively (Fig.4). The vis -
ual acuity of the XLRP group was worse than that of the 
ADR
P group (Table  2), which also indicates that XLRP 
leads to seriously damage.
The mean CT of the XLRP and ADRP group are pre -
sented in Table  3. The C T of t he XLRP group 3000  μm to  
the temporal side of the fovea was smaller than that of the 
ADRP group, while there was no significant thinning in the 
other locations we studied (p  = 0.007). We f
ound that the 
CT measurements of the XLRP children showed a more 
severe reduction on the temporal side than those of ADRP 
children. The temporal thinning of the choroid was more 
pronounced in children with RP and XLRP than in the con -
trol and ADRP groups, respectively. There were positive 
cor
relations between macular thicknesses and sub-choroi -
dal thicknesses in RP group (Fig.5 ). Some c linical data from 
2 patients with XLRP and ADRP are shown in Fig. 6 .

Discussion
Our results suggest that the thickness of the retina of 
RP children is smaller than that of the control group 
and that the RT at the fovea is smaller in XLRP children 
than in ADRP children. There are diurnal variations in 
the retina and choroid measurements, so we carried 
out our OCT examinations in the afternoon [9 ]. The decrease in the RT with the progression of RP is due to 
progressive degeneration of the rod and cone cells; the 
typical early changes in RP are represented by short -
ening of the outer segments of photoreceptors, with 
gradu
al degeneration of the cones [10]. In a study by 
Yildirim, M.A., the RT of RP patients was significantly 
lower than that of normal subjects [11]. The disease Table  2 Retinal thicknesses of each group

affects the entire retina but shows regional variation 
in the severity of degeneration [12]. Thus, the RT val -
ues obtained in our study indicated that the severity of 
damage ne
ar the macula was greater in the XLRP group 
than in the ADRP group. The reduction in the thickness 
in the macular area is more serious in children with an 
XLRP genotype than in those with an ADRP genotype. 
Our findings also provided evidence that the changes in 
thicknesses may be representative of the greater sever -
ity of XLRP versus ADRP in the early stage.Thinning on t
he temporal side of the choroid was more 
obvious in RP than in healthy children and in XLRP than 
in ADRP children. This choroidal thickening is different 
from that in children with simple myopia, for whom it 
begins in central foveal regions [13]. The choroid pro -
vides nutrition to outer retinal structures and plays a 
signific
ant role in the pathophysiology of RP [14]. The 
CT is significantly lower in RP patients than in normal 
controls [15, 16]. As the sub-choroidal thicknesses thin -
ning, the macular thicknesses become smaller in RP .

Histopathological studies have confirmed that poor cho -
roidal blood flow leads to thinning of the choroid, which 
als
o leads to photoreceptor damage. The loss of photore -
ceptors results in decreased oxygen demand and a conse -
quent reduction in the blood supply. The quantification 
of C
T could reflect changes in ocular vascular perfusion [17]. Our results suggest that the temporal flow is more 
likely to be affected. Therefore, retinal degeneration may 
stimulate choroidal atrophy, and conversely, choroidal 
changes may worsen the degeneration of the outer ret -
ina. This may also explain why XLRP patients develop 
sy
mptoms earlier and have more severe impairment than 
ADRP patients.

The severity of the disease is closely related to its heter -
ogeneous genetic basis. The severe forms of RP are within 
the c
ategory of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Patients 
are characterized by a severe phenotype even in the early 
stages of disease development [18], with earlier onset of 
night blindness, more rapid constriction of visual fields 
and, eventually, more severe loss of central acuity than 
in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa [19]. Most 
affected males exhibit early-onset symptoms, with night 
blindness in the first decade, a reduction in the visual 
field in the second decade, and rapid progression towards 
blindness (worse than approximately 20/200) by 40  years
 
of age [20]. The majority of mutations that cause XLRP 
lead to abnormal protein distribution in the cell [21]. As 
the disease progresses, it affects the function of tubulin 
and ciliary structures and causes increasing damage to 
structures and function [22]. A number of retinal proteins 
are required for cilia-dependent outer segment transport, 
generation or maintenance [23]. The abnormality of the 
connecting cilia could result in decreased protein trans -
port from the inner to the outer photoreceptor [24].
Two genoty
pes of XLRP are common in the clinic: RPGR 
and RP2. RPGR is characterized by conserved guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors. The protein localizes to the 
outer segment of photoreceptors. RPGR defects can occur 
at multiple steps in material transport towards the distal 
outer segment [23]. Due to the importance of these path -
ways in photoreceptor development and survival, mutations 
in RP
GR might disrupt the interactions and lead to retinal 
degeneration. Mutations in RP2 cause the second most fre -
quent form of XLRP [21]. The gene products show homology 
wit
h human cofactor C, which acts as a GTPase-activating 
protein in the final step of beta-tubulin folding. RP2 also 
interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3), which 
acts as a microtubule-associated small GTP-binding pro -
tein that localizes to the sensory cilia of photoreceptors [23]. 
Mut
ations in RP2 lead to the accumulation of incorrectly 
folded photoreceptor- or neuron-specific tubulin isoforms, 
resulting in the progressive degeneration of the retina.
ADRP is a relatively mild form of RP . The gene muta -
tions associated with ADRP can result in altered pro -
tein activity, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction due to 
misf
olded mutant protein molecules, mistrafficking and 
mislocalization of the mutant protein, and even adverse 
effects on the proper functioning of the wild-type pro -
tein, thus affecting the homeostasis of cells and ulti-
mately resulting in their death [25]. ADRP includes 30 
genoty p
es, such as RHO mutations. RHO mutations are 
associated with two phenomena: interference with the 
function of normal rhodopsin and intrinsic toxicity of the 
mutant protein. Most of the mutations lead to opsin mis -
folding and instability, leading to a relatively mild disease 
phenoty p
e [26].In conclusion, the choroid in RP children becomes 
thinner preferentially on the temporal side of the macula, 
and thinning of the retina is relatively extensive. Children 
with RP have strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. 
The XLRP children demonstrated greater RT reduction 
at the fovea and greater CT reduction at the temporal 
side of the macula than the ADRP children. Our findings 
also provided evidence that the changes in thicknesses 
may be indicative of the greater severity of XLRP versus 
ADRP in the early stage.
This study has some limitations. The retinal and cho -
roidal thicknesses were measured manually, which may 
cr
eate a potential bias. The study sample size was small, 
and larger studies should be conducted. Axial length 
can interfere with accurate retinal and choroidal thick -
ness measurements, and our future research should be 
more c
omprehensive. As this was a retrospective study, 
the data are prone to bias. Additionally, further studies 
should investigate whether the refractive state of children 
with XLRP and children with ADRP affects retinal thick -
ness. We should also perform more refined genetic data 
analy s
es, which may reveal other factors contributing to 
the diagnosis and prognosis of RP . Further studies might 
enhance our clinical evaluation of such patients.
