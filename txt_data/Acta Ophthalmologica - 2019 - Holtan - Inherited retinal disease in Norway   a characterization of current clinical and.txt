ABSTRACT.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to characterize current clinical and
genetic knowledge of patients with inherited retinal disease in Norway and give
an estimate of the prevalence. These data are necessary to identify patients
eligible for new personalized medicines, to facilitate genetic counselling for their
families and to plan clinical follow-up.
Methods: A patient registry including clinical and genetic data was established.
Clinical data were retrieved during 2003 –2018. Genetic testing was performed in
the period 2007 –2018.
Results: The material included 866 patients with 41 clinical diagnoses at the cut-oﬀ
date. The most prevalent diseases were as follows: retinitis pigmentosa (54%),
Stargardt macular dystrophy (6.5%) and Leber congenital amaurosis (5.2%). A
genetic diagnosis was identiﬁed in 32% of patients. In total, 207 disease-causing
variantsin56geneswerereported.Themostcommonlyreporteddisease-causinggenes
were ABCA4, USH2A andBEST1 . The estimated adjusted minimum prevalence of
inherited retinal disease in the south-east region of Norway was 1: 3,856 (2.6/10 000).
Conclusion: This population-based study demonstrated an estimated prevalence
for all inherited retinal diseases in south-east Norway and described the
distribution of clinical diagnoses, onset of symptoms, inheritance patterns and
genetic data and thereby expands our knowledge of inherited retinal disease in
Norway. The newly established registry and biobank will support patient
feasibility for future clinical trials, treatment selection and counselling of families.

Introduction
Inherited retinal disease (IRD) is
among the most common cause ofdebilitating low vision and blindness
in children and young adults (Bunce
et al. 2010). Inherited retinal disease
(IRD) is a highly heterogeneous groupof genetic diseases characterized by
degeneration of the retina. The many
subtypes are classiﬁed according to
mode of inheritance, age at onset of
symptoms, rate of disease progression,
principal site of retinal dysfunction
(rods, cones, retinal pigment epithe-
lium, inner retina and choroid) and
association with syndromes (Puech
et al. 2014). The knowledge of genetic
causes of IRD is steadily increasing,
and alterations in more than 300 genes
and loci are now known to cause IRD (
www.retnet.org). Through knowledge
of the genetic defects, underlying dis-
ease-causing pathologic mechanisms
are increasingly elucidated (Allikmets
1997; Gu et al. 1997; Riise 1998; Men-
des et al. 2005).
Numerous therapeutic approaches
are currently being investigated in pre-
clinical studies and clinical trials,
including innovative gene-speciﬁc
vision-restoring therapies, cell trans-
plantations, optogenetics, artiﬁcial reti-
nal prostheses and pharmacological
agents (Narfstrom et al. 2003; Hoﬀ-
man et al. 2004; Bainbridge et al. 2008;
Hauswirth et al. 2008; Maguire et al.
2008; Busskamp et al. 2010; Jinek et al.
2012; Klassen et al. 2012; Bennett et al.
2016; MacLaren et al. 2016; Stingl
et al. 2017).
The ﬁrst gene therapy of IRD has
been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration and European Medici-
nes Agency (Bennett et al. 2016; Apte
2018), and two retinal prostheses are
286Acta Ophthalmologica 2020
commercially available (Stingl et al.
2017; Ferlauto et al. 2018). Accurate
clinical characterization (phenotype)and genetic characterization (genotype)
are very important for the selection of
the most suitable treatment options.Since these treatments are customized
according to the speciﬁc phenotype and
genotype, systematic registration ofgenetic and clinical data of patients
with IRD is highly warranted.
The purpose of this study was to
characterize current clinical and geneticknowledge of patients with IRD living
in Norway and estimate the prevalence.
To fulﬁl this purpose, a comprehensiveregistry with high data integrity of
clinical and genetic data, linked with
biological material, was established,thus providing a foundation for the
assessment of current and future
healthcare needs for this patient popu-lation and assuring early treatmentwith new therapies.
Materials and Methods
Registry design and establishment of the
biobank of IRD
To enable systematic characterization
of clinical and genetic data, a registry
was created. The following qualityparameters were pursued: (1) the reg-
istry should be accurate and compre-
hensive, including patient informationthat adequately describes the geneticbackground, the disease phenotype andpatient status/disease progression over
time; (2) the solution must securely
prevent inadvertent data access, pro-vide data integrity and create unique
and retrievable patient codes linked to
the Norwegian national register oﬃcewith a secure link key to allow for
accurate updates and follow-up; (3) the
registry must have the ability to createdetailed reports linked to Orpha codes;
and (4) there must be export possibil-
ities of data to statistical programs andother database solutions, assuring thatan expansion to include all inherited
ophthalmic diseases and other causes
of visual impairment will be possible inlater phases of this project. The registry
was created in the patient registry
solution MedInsight, which fulﬁlledall listed requirements. The registry
was established in MedInsight in 2016.
Six basic information fans were
included: (1) family history with familyidentiﬁer (ID) number, parents’ birth-
place, consanguinity between parents
and registration of other family mem-bers with the same disease including
registry ID; (2) patient’s medical his-
tory including other illnesses, hearingstatus, syndromic features, regular
medication, age at onset of symptoms
and self-reported perception of vision;(3) clinical examination including clin-
ical diagnosis, visual acuity, general
ophthalmic examination with detailson status of the vitreous, optic disc,fundus pigmentation, macula and ves-
sels; (4) technical examinationincluding electroretinography (ERG),
electrooculography (EOG), optical
coherence tomography (OCT) andultra-wide-ﬁeld autoﬂuorescence (UW-
AF); (5) genetic status with mode of
inheritance, genetic analysis method,date of analysis, results of genetic
analysis and if the patient is genetically
solved; and (6) treatment of retinaldisease or other ophthalmic conditions.
Access to the registry is restricted to
personnel involved in clinical follow-up, according to Norwegian privacylegislation. The registry is approved by
the patient data security unit, Oslo
University Hospital.
The biobank of IRD was created in
2016 after approval from the Regional
Ethics Committee, south-east Norway,REK #2015/1584. The biobank is
linked to the registry through a sepa-
rate code list and includes biologicalmaterial from patients and their par-ents, when available. Each sample is
uniquely coded enabling linkage to
patient data through the code list.Biological material is stored for future
genetic testing of patients who are not
genetically solved. Parental DNA isused to validate genetic results when
needed.
Participants
Clinical data collection of IRD patients
was initiated in 2003, after approvalfrom the patient data security unit,
Oslo University Hospital (Fig. 1). The
Fig. 1. Timeline for data collection up to cut-oﬀ date for present study, 17 March 2018. Registration of clinical data was initiated in 2003 after
approval from the patient data security unit, Oslo University Hospital. Patients were included after clinical assessment and electroretinography at the
Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital. In 2016, the registry was established in registration software MedInsight, thereby enabli ng
export of detailed clinical and genetic data reports. Genetic testing was initiated in 2007. The biobank of inherited retinal disease was establishe da t
Oslo University Hospital in 2016. After cut-oﬀ date of this study, genetic testing with HTS approach and full gene panels has been available at two
Norwegian laboratories. Genetically unresolved patients plan to be analysed with full gene-panel HTS approach. Registration in the registry ofinherited retinal disease is ongoing.

data collected since 2003 were vali-
dated and collected through medical
records and manually recorded in thenewly established registry of IRD.
Inclusion criteria for registration in
the registry of IRD are living patientswith a clinical diagnosis of IRD either
isolated or systemic/syndromic. Multi-
factorial disorders, such as age-relatedmacular degeneration, are excluded
from the registry. The clinical diagnosis
is obtained by ophthalmic examina-tion, ERG and EOG results, OCT,ultra-wide-ﬁeld retinal images (UW-
AF), visual ﬁeld examination and in
some cases ﬂuorescein angiography.
Inclusion criteria for the present
study were living patients registered in
the registry of IRD at the cut-oﬀ date of17 March 2018. Female carriers of X-
linked dystrophies were excluded from
the present study as well as patients witha diagnosis of Leber hereditary opticneuropathy and isolated optic atrophy.
Norway is divided into four health
regions: south-east, north, west andcentral. Patients from all four health
regions are in the registry, but only
patients who live in the south-eastregion are routinely referred to Oslo
University Hospital for electrophysio-
logical diagnosis of IRD. The popula-tion in the south-east region of Norway
is 2.98 million people and constitutes
55% of the total Norwegian popula-tion (ssb.no). For prevalence calcula-tions in this study, only patients living
in the south-east region were included.
To validate prevalence calculations,data were also collected from the Nor-
wegian Patient Registry (NPR). All
Norwegian citizens have a unique per-sonal identiﬁcation number (PIN) that
follows them throughout life. Norwe-
gian Patient Registry (NPR) is linkedto this PIN and contains information
of all persons who either have received
treatment or are waiting for treatmentin specialist health care through regis-tration of ICD-10 codes. Data linked
to individual patients have been avail-
able from the NPR since 2008.
This study was conducted after
approval from the patient data security
unit, Oslo University Hospital. Allparticipants (including patient’s par-
ents) included in the biobank of IRD
provided written informed consent forthe storage of biological material in thebiobank and for genetic analysis. The
study followed the tenets of the Decla-
ration of Helsinki.Genetic testing and inheritance patterns
Genetic testing of IRD patients in Nor-way was initiated in 2007 after initiative
from the Norwegian Retinitis Pigmen-
tosa Association and last author (RB)(Fig. 1). Gene-panel testing for IRDwas at the time not available in Norway;
therefore, arrayed primer extension
(APEX) from Asper Ophthalmics wasselected ( www.asperbio.com). From
2007 to 2016, the genetic testing was
primarily performed using APEX. Withthis method, each patient was tested for
a panel of known disease-causing muta-
tions (pathogenic variants). The panelwas selected based on the patient’sclinical diagnosis and presumed inheri-
tance pattern. The panels were fre-
quently updated, for example, thepanel for autosomal recessive retinitis
pigmentosa consisted in 2007 of ﬁve
genes and 518 known pathogenic vari-ants and single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs, deﬁned by Asper
Ophthalmics as DNA sequence varia-tion that occurs in at least 1% of the
population and is nonpathogenic or
possibly nonpathogenic). In 2016, thesame panel consisted of 28 genes and 709known pathogenic variants and SNPs.
In 2016, APEX was replaced with
genetic testing of gene panels sequencedwith high-throughput sequencing
(HTS) techniques. The HTS subgene
panels were, as APEX subpanels,designed based on clinical diagnosis
and presumed inheritance pattern. In
2017, the HTS panel for autosomalrecessive retinitis pigmentosa consistedof 39 genes. The content of both the
variant panels (APEX) and the gene
panels (HTS) thus changed frequentlyduring the 11 years of testing, as they
were updated to the current status of
knowledge, and a complete list of allvariants and genes tested over time is
therefore not available for this study.
Genetic testing during this 11-year
period was primarily performed using
Asper Ophthalmics (APEX or HTS).
When analysis of relevant genes orpanels was available, within the Nor-wegian healthcare system, genetic anal-
ysis was performed by Norwegian
laboratories. In some cases, patient-initiated genetic testing was performed
in other countries. The genetic testing
method used was not always describedin the results rapport, and for these
cases, the method is in the registry
listed as ‘not known’.Variants found by HTS were inter-
preted by Asper Ophthalmics using
ClinVar classiﬁcation status and popu-lation frequencies from the ExAC and
the gnomAD website. Prediction of
pathogenicity was analysed by AsperOphthalmics using SiftRank, LrtRank,
MutTasterRank, MutAssesorRank,
ProveanRank, MetaSvmRank,MetaLrRank and Genomic Evolution-
ary Rate Proﬁling parameter rank.
Variants found by APEX were classiﬁedas mutations or SNPs. Variants foundby HTS were classiﬁed as benign, likely
benign, likely pathogenic and patho-
genic (Richards et al. 2015). Correspon-dence between genotype and phenotype
was evaluated by the ophthalmic and
clinical genetics team before concludingon the genetic diagnosis.
Genetically solved cases were
deﬁned as the identiﬁcation of patho-genic variant(s) that explained the rel-evant phenotype and inheritance
pattern in the family. When only one
pathogenic variant was found in apatient with assumed recessive inheri-
tance, the patient was classiﬁed as not
solved.
Mode of inheritance was classiﬁed
into three steps: ﬁrstly, patients were
classiﬁed as familial or sporadic cases.Secondly in familial cases, inheritance
pattern autosomal recessive (AR) was
assigned when there were multipleaﬀected siblings with nonaﬀected par-ents, autosomal dominant (AD) was
assigned in nonconsanguineous fami-
lies with vertical transmission of thedisease to both males and females, and
X-linked (XL) was assigned to families
with multiple aﬀected males connectedthrough (healthy) females or an
aﬀected male and a female carrier.
Finally, the inheritance mode wasmodiﬁed after results from genetic
testing, both in sporadic and in familial
cases. Sporadic cases that were genet-ically unsolved were classiﬁed as ofunknown inheritance.
Results
Prevalence of inherited retinal disease in
south-east Norway
On 1 January 2018, a total of 855
patients were registered. Of these, 685
were alive and living in the south-eastregion of Norway out of a populationof 2 977 723 people at the time
(ssb.no). We estimated the minimum

prevalence of IRD in the south-east
region, all ages, to 1: 4347 (2.3/10 000).
Due to a left truncation bias in agedistribution and a presumed delayed
registration and diagnosis of children
under the age of 16 (Figs 2, 3), preva-lence calculations were also made forthe age group 16 –66 years. Of the 2.9
million people in the south-east region,
1 982 174 were aged 16 –66 years
(ssb.no). In total, 514 patients aged
16–66 years were registered with a
clinical diagnosis IRD on 1 January2018, giving an estimated adjustedminimum prevalence of IRD in the
south-east region, 1: 3856 (2.6/10 000).
A total of 483 individuals with
generalized retinal dystrophies (iso-
lated and syndromic retinitis pigmen-
tosa, Leber congenital amaurosis,cone-rod dystrophy and chorioretinal
dystrophy) were alive and living in the
south-east region, corresponding to anestimated minimum prevalence of 1:
6165 (1.6/10 000). For the age group
16–66 years, there were a total of 368
patients registered with generalizedretinal dystrophy, living in the south-
east region, giving an estimated
adjusted minimum prevalence of 1:5386 (1.9/10 000)
A total of 164 individuals with
inherited macula dystrophies (achro-matopsia, Best’s vitelliform dystrophy,
cone dystrophy, Stargardt macular
dystrophy, X-linked retinoschisis andmacular dystrophy other) were aliveand living in the south-east region
corresponding to an estimated mini-
mum prevalence of 1: 18 268 (6/100 000). For the age group 16 –
66 years (134 patients), the adjusted
minimum prevalence was calculated to1:14 792 (7/100 000).
For comparison, data from NPR
demonstrated that 3638 were registeredwith the ICD-10 code H35.5 for
inherited retinal disease in the period
2008 –2016. Of those, 1559 were living
in the south-east region out of apopulation of 2 773 976 (1 January
2017) (ssb.no) resulting in a prevalence
of 1: 1779 (5.6/10 000).
Characterization of the study population
Clinical data
Clinical data of 866 living individuals
with IRD from 832 families wereavailable for analysis. A total of 41
distinct clinical diagnoses in 15 cate-
gories were observed (Table 1). Themost prevalent clinical diagnoses wereretinitis pigmentosa (54%), Stargardt
macular dystrophy (6.5%) and Leber
congenital amaurosis (5.2%).(Table 2).
Age at onset of symptoms ranged
from the ﬁrst year of life to 83 years,with a mean age at onset of 20.2 years.
In total, 330 (50%) patients had onset
of symptoms in childhood before theage of 16 years (Fig. 2). Patients with aclinical diagnosis of achromatopsia,

congenital amaurosis and ocular albin-
ism all reported an onset of symptomsbetween the ﬁrst year of life to
18 years. Patients with retinitis pig-
mentosa demonstrated a mean age atonset of 24.4 years and median of
20.0 years, onset ranging from 0 to
83 years (Fig. 3).
Demographic data
The patients were born between 1927and 2017, and 452 (52%) were men.The mean age was 42.7 years. In total,
730 (84%) patients were under the ageof 65 years, 318 (37%) under the age of
35 years and 91 (10%) under the age of15 years at the time of cut-oﬀ (Fig. 4).
Parents’ birthplace was included in
715 patient cases (83%). Of those, 546(76.4%) had two parents born in Nor-
way, 41 (5.7%) had one Norwegian
parent and one parent originating fromanother country, and 25 (2.9%) had
parents that originated from another
European country. The remaining 15%had parents originating from countriesoutside Europe. A total of 40 countries
of origin were observed.Of all patients in the registry, 691
(80%) were from the south-east health
region in Norway. Patients from the
three remaining health regions weredistributed as follows: central (72; 8%),
north (27; 3%) and west (58; 7%).
Inheritance
The clinical inheritance pattern was AR
in 26.1% of patients, AD in 12.2%, XLin 4.5%, mitochondrial in 0.2% andunknown in the remaining 56.9% of the
study population. Due to lack of par-
ental testing, no patients were registeredwith conﬁrmed de novo variants. The
four health regions showed a similar
distribution of inheritance patterns.Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance
ranged from 22% in the northern region
to 33% in the western region. Inheri-tance patterns in patient cases whereboth parents originated from Norway
were AR in 25.6%, and in cases where
parents originated from the same coun-try outside of Europe, the rate of reces-
sive classiﬁcation was 37.6.%. In 49
(6%) patient cases, consanguinitybetween parents was reported. Of the
546 patient cases where both parents
were born in Norway, 46% (241 patientcases) reported that the parents were
born in the same county. Of the 241
patient cases, 26% (63 patient cases)were conﬁrmed to have autosomalrecessive disease. Distribution of inher-
itance patterns is shown in Table 3.Table 1. The 41 phenotypes were grouped into 15 clinical diagnosis categories.

Genetic data
A total of 650 patients were genetically
tested. Of those, 207 (32.0%) were
classiﬁed as genetically solved. Theoverall genetically solved rate for
APEX was 24.0% (102 out of 427
patients, 16 patients with nonresultingAPEX performed before HTS) and for
HTS 38.5% (50 out of 130 patients)
(Fig. 5). The genetically solved ratewas over 70% in the clinical categoriesachromatopsia, Bardet –Biedl syn-
drome, Best’s vitelliform dystrophy,
Stargardt macular dystrophy and X-linked retinoschisis. However, under
20% were genetically solved among
patients with clinical diagnoses ofchorioretinal dystrophy, macula dys-
trophy and retinitis pigmentosa
(Table 4). Genetic testing had beenperformed in less than 50% of patients
with clinical diagnoses of chorioretinal
dystrophy and congenital stationarynight blindness (Fig. 6).
A total of 56 genes with 207
pathogenic variants were identiﬁed.Of the 207 variants, 37 variants were
not found in ClinVar ( www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/clinvar/) or HGMD (Human
Gene Mutation Database, Professional2019.1). HGMD/ClinVar classiﬁed the
identiﬁed variants as pathogenic in
84% and likely pathogenic in 14% ofcases. Two variants had been reclassi-
ﬁed to likely benign or benign since
original classiﬁcation was performedby Asper Ophthalmics (a list of allvariants is available in Table S1).
Most variants (89%) were nonrecur-
rent and found in fewer than fourpatients. The most frequent pathogenic
variants were missense (56.0%) fol-
lowed by frameshift (20.8%), nonsense(14.0%), splice (8.2%) and others
(1.0%). The most prevalent gene
reported with pathogenic variant(s)was ABCA4 (MIM: 601691) which
was observed in 69 patients (20.4%).
The second most prevalently reportedgene was USH2A (MIM:608400) which
was seen in 66 patients (19.5%), of
these nine were classiﬁed as geneticallysolved. The remaining 57 patients
showed a single heterozygous patho-
genic or likely pathogenic variant. Thethird most prevalently reported gene
wasBEST1 (MIM:607854) which was
seen in 22 patients (6.5%) of geneticallytested patients. Of the 22 patients for
whom a pathogenic BEST1 variant was
found, ﬁve patients had autosomalrecessive bestrophinopathy.
Genes that were associated with
more than one clinical diagnosis wereABCA4, PRPH2, GUCY2D,RPGRIP1, USH2A and CACNA1F .
Associated genes in each clinical diag-
nosis category are presented in Table 4.
Correlation of age at onset of symp-
toms to the ﬁve most prevalently
aﬀected genes showed a broad rangeof onset in ABCA4-, BEST1-, RHO-
andUSH2A- associated retinal dystro-
phies. Patients with RS1-associated
retinal disease had onset of symptomsbefore the age of 10 years (Fig. 7).
Of the 659 patients who were genet-
ically unsolved or not geneticallytested, biological material is available
for 360 (55%) in the biobank. Biolog-
ical material from at least one parent isavailable in 137 (38%) of the unsolved

This is the ﬁrst population-based anal-
ysis and published estimated preva-lence for allIRD in south-east
Norway. To adjust for left truncation
bias and a delayed registration ofchildren under 16 years, an estimated
adjusted minimum prevalence for all
IRD was also calculated, which leadsto a higher estimated prevalence. Tofurther validate the data, we compared
prevalence data from NPR with our
data and can conclude that the esti-mated minimum prevalence of allIRD
in south-east Norway is between 1:
1779 and 1: 4347. A population-basedestimated prevalence of allIRD has to
our knowledge not been reported
before and can therefore not be com-pared to other studies.
The estimated adjusted minimum
prevalence for generalized retinal dys-trophy was found in the present studyto be 1: 5386 (1.9/10 000). In compar-
ison, Grondahl found in Norway in
1987 a lower prevalence (1: 8069), butthis estimate was based on a smaller
population sample (815 000) (Gron-
dahl 1987). In Denmark, an estimate

of prevalence for generalized retinal
dystrophy was found to be 1: 3454
(Bertelsen et al. 2014) and was basedon data from the entire population (5.6
million). In Denmark, data on IRD
have been collected since the 1850s,whereas the data in our study have
only been collected since 2003, possibly
leading to the diﬀerences in estimates.In other international epidemiological
studies, prevalence estimates show
great variation, ranging from 1: 750to 1: 7000 (Ammann et al. 1965;Bundey & Crews 1984; Bunker et al.
1984; Nangia et al. 2012; You et al.
2013). Population diﬀerences may bethe cause of this variation; however,
these studies diﬀer in inclusion criteria
and population size, which may alsoaﬀect the prevalence estimates.
The clinical distribution of pheno-
types in our study (retinitis pigmentosa54.0%, Stargardt macular dystrophy6.5%, Leber congenital amaurosis
5.2%) is comparable to what was
reported in the Australian inheritedretinal disease register (retinitis pig-
mentosa 61.0%, Stargardt macular
dystrophy 9.9%, cone/cone-rod dystro-phy 4.4%) (De Roach et al. 2013).
Cone dystrophy and cone-rod dystro-
phy represented two diﬀerent clinicaldiagnosis categories in the present
study; in the Australian study, these
were combined into one clinical diag-nosis category resulting in a moreprevalent subgroup.
Our results showed a distribution of
inheritance pattern similar to what wasreported from the Danish Retinitis
Pigmentosa Registry (Bertelsen et al.
2014). However, in the Danish studydistribution of inheritance pattern
showed a lower percentage of AD cases
(6%) and a lower percentage ofunknown inheritance pathway (45%)
compared to the present study. This
diﬀerence is most likely due to the lowrate of genetically solved patients inthis study as well as a possible ascer-
tainment bias.
Only 32% of the patients were
classiﬁed as genetically solved. Other
studies of IRD report somewhat higher
diagnostic yield, with detection ratesfrom 39% to 76% (O’Sullivan et al.
2012; Eisenberger et al. 2013; Huang
et al. 2015; Ellingford et al. 2016; Patelet al. 2016; Tiwari et al. 2016; Carsset al. 2017; Khan et al. 2017; Stone
et al. 2017). High-throughput sequenc-
ing (HTS) had a higher diagnostic yieldFig. 5. Flow chart demonstrating genetic status in all 866 patients including method. *16 patients

than APEX. The diagnostic yield of
APEX is limited by the correct selec-
tion of the subpanel as well as number
of genes and known pathogenic vari-ants on the panel at the time of testing.Both the number of genes and known
pathogenic variants in the APEXpanels did increase over the 9-year
period they were used, but despite
this, the diagnostic yield was low. The
HTS approach was similarly limitedby correct selection of subpanel thatwas determined by clinical diagnosis
and presumed inheritance pattern,thereby increasing risk of selecting
the wrong panel of genes. This limita-
tion is reﬂected in the slightly lowerdetection rate of HTS in this study.
Thereby, demonstrating that the
heterogeneity in IRD most likelyrequires HTS diagnostic methods with
gene panels including all IRD disease-
causing genes to achieve higher diag-nostic yields. However, for patients
with phenotypes strongly associated
with a single gene, as ABCA4 -associ-
ated retinal dystrophies, Sangersequencing of a single gene can be
beneﬁcial. This was conﬁrmed in this
study by the fact that phenotypes thatwere clinically distinct and related to
only one gene had a higher genetically
solved rate such as Best’s vitelliformdystrophy, Stargardt macular dystro-
phy and X-linked retinoschisis com-
pared to phenotypes with geneticheterogeneity such as retinitis pigmen-tosa, cone-rod dystrophy, cone dys-
trophy and Leber congenital
amaurosis. An exception was Bardet –
Biedl syndrome where 18 disease-caus-
ing genes are known (OMIM #
209900) and where diagnostic yieldwas as high as 13/17 (77%). The
higher diagnostic yield in Bardet –Biedl
syndrome is most likely due to exten-sive international research of Norwe-
gian patients with this syndrome
(Riise 1998; Hjortshoj et al. 2010).
The rate of genetically solved
patients in this study is low. The reason
for this is most likely that the patients
were genetically tested over a period of11 years, during which knowledge
about genetic causes of IRD has grown
dramatically. As such, the patientshave been tested with a range of
diﬀerent approaches with highly diﬀer-
ent sensitivity. Unfortunately, many ofthe patients in our cohort have not yet
been retested with up-to-date methods,
which render the cohort with an overalllow diagnostic yield.
Despite the low rate of genetically
solved patients, the study does conﬁrm
genetic and allelic heterogeneity in IRDpatients in Norway, with a total of 207
pathogenic variants in 56 genes.
The most prevalent genes with
pathogenic variants were ABCA4 ,
USH2A and BEST1 . Other genetic
cohort studies of IRD have alsodemonstrated a high prevalence ofABCA4 and USH2A (Huang et al.
2015; Carss et al. 2017; Stone et al.
2017).

has been found or only one variant has been found in a non-dominant phenotype. Not knownindicates that the results of the genetic testing are inconclusive.

only represents patients that were genetically solved, with a retinal dystrophy associated with oneof the ﬁve most prevalent genes and registered age at onset was available, which in total was 154patients. In each box plot, the lower and upper boundary of the box represent the ﬁrst quartile
(i.e., 25th percentile) and the third quartile (i.e., 75th percentile) of the data, respectively; the
horizontal black line in the box is the median; the X in the box is the mean; the lower and upperwhiskers are the lowest and highest values of the data that are not outliers. Any circle outside thewhiskers is an outlier (i.e., the data value is greater than 1.5 interquartile ranges away from the ﬁrst
and third quartiles).

In 83% of the patients where patho-
genic or likely pathogenic variants in
the USH2A gene were found, the
patient was classiﬁed as genetically
unsolved. Due to a high carrier fre-
quency of variants in USH2A in the
European population (1/70) (Besnard
et al. 2014), it is uncertain if the vari-
ants found in the USH2A gene in these
patients are part of the genetic cause.
BEST1 has, to our knowledge, not
before been reported within a top threeprevalence in a study population. Thephenotype –genotype correlation of
Best’s vitelliform dystrophy is in many
patients very distinct and may haveincreased the likelihood of selecting the
correct gene subpanel. Further, 17 out
of 22 patients were solved with APEXand the high prevalence of BEST1 may
be due to a more complete variant list
than was found in other gene lists inAPEX at the time of testing, thusleading to a biased result in our study.
BEST1 retinopathies are primarily
dominant; therefore, it was remarkablethat ﬁve out of 22 patients had patho-
genic variants in both alleles, indicating
that a higher prevalence of recessiveBEST1 variants may be present in the
Norwegian population. It should be
noted that this study included only 22patients with BEST1 variants and the
high number of recessive inheritance
should be carefully interpreted. Morecomplete genetic data and inclusion ofmore patients are needed to determine
the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding.
Depending on the expressivity of the
pathogenic genetic variants, one gene
can cause great clinical variability. This
was highlighted in this study by thegreat variation in age at onset of
symptoms for the most prevalent
genes. To thoroughly investigate thisvariation and genotype –phenotype cor-
relations in the Norwegian population,
the newly established registry withdetailed clinical data will be exploredtogether with the addition of more
complete genetic data sets.
The ﬁrst gene-speciﬁc vision-restor-
ing therapy for an IRD has been
approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration and European Medici-nes Agency. Patients with bi-allelic
pathogenic variants in RPE65
(MIM:180069) and a retinal dystrophyare eligible for this treatment (Bennettet al. 2016; Apte 2018). For the phe-
notype-isolated retinitis pigmentosa
and Leber congenital amaurosis, 0.6%were RPE65 related in our study pop-
ulation. Despite being a very rare
disorder, pathogenic RPE65 variants
have been reported in Denmark to be
the most prevalent cause of Leber
congenital amaurosis (16%) (Astutiet al. 2016). In North America, it is
reported to cause 1 –2% of all autoso-
mal recessive retinitis pigmentosa cases(Apte 2018). It is likely that some of the
patients with early-onset retinitis pig-
mentosa or Leber congenital amaurosisthat are not genetically solved in ourstudy population harbour a RPE65
pathogenic variant.
This study’s main limitation is
incomplete geographic coverage, skew-
ness in age distribution and a low rate
of genetically solved patients. Asdemonstrated, the older population is
underrepresented in the registry and
therefore also in this study. Thereseems to be a delay in diagnosis andregistration of younger patients, since
age at onset of symptoms in 50% of
patients was reported to be before16 years; however, this does not corre-
late with the age distribution of the
study population. Inclusion in the reg-istry is ongoing, and with time, these
shortcomings are expected to be cor-
rected. Genetic testing of the studypopulation has been performed over a
period of 11 years, and the broad
diﬀerences in genetic testing techniquesand gene panels did, as demonstrated,decrease the genetically solved rate of
the study population. By utilizing the
biobank of IRD, genetically unresolvedpatients will be genetically reanalysed.
Conclusion
Using a newly established high-quality
registry of IRD patients, this study
provides the ﬁrst comprehensive clini-cal and genetic characterization of IRD
in the Norwegian population with
minimum prevalence estimates. Theregistry establishes a foundation for
indispensable research for these blind-
ing diseases, giving us new knowledgeof phenotypes and genetic causes in
this patient group in Norway.
