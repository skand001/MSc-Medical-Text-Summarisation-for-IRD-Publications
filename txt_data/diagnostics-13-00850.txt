Abstract: Background. Eyes shut homolog (EYS) gene mutations are estimated to affect at least
5% of patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Since there is no mammalian model
of human EYS disease, it is important to investigate its age-related changes and the degree of
central retinal impairment. Methods. A cohort of EYS patients was studied. They underwent full
ophthalmic examination as well as assessment of retinal function and structure, by full-ﬁeld and focal
electroretinograms (ERGs) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively.
The disease severity stage was determined by the RP stage scoring system (RP-SSS). Central retina
atrophy (CRA) was estimated from the automatically calculated area of the sub-retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) illumination (SRI). Results. The RP-SSS was positively correlated with age, showing
an advanced severity score ( 8) at an age of 45 and a disease duration of 15 years. The RP-SSS was
positively correlated with the CRA area. LogMAR visual acuity and ellipsoid zone width, but not
ERG, were correlated with CRA. Conclusions. In EYS-related disease, the RP-SSS showed advanced
severity at a relative early age and was correlated with the central area of the RPE/photoreceptor
atrophy. These correlations may be relevant in view of therapeutic interventions aimed at rescuing
rods and cones in EYS-retinopathy.

1. Introduction
Pathogenic variants in the eyes shut homolog (EYS) gene are estimated to affect at
least 5% of patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) [ 1]. The gene is
defective in several arRP populations worldwide [ 2–5]. EYS encodes a large extracellular
protein [ 6] that in Drosophila promotes the formation of epithelial lumina, a selective
space inside the rhabdomeres which isolates individual photoreceptor cells and is useful
for their development [ 7]. In humans, the function of EYS is not yet fully understood.
However, the protein product is thought to play a role in stabilizing ciliary axonemes in
rods and cones and it is involved in the maintenance of photoreceptor cells [ 8]. Since
there is no mammalian model of human EYS disease, it is important to investigate its
Diagnostics 2023 ,13, 850. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13050850 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnosticsDiagnostics 2023 ,13, 850 2 of 12
age-related retinal changes in both structure and function, as well as the degree of central
retina involvement.
Recently, Iftikhar et al. [ 9] developed a simple and easily applicable classiﬁcation of
disease severity in RP patients, with a score based on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
Goldmann visual ﬁeld diameter and ellipsoid zone (EZ) width. This RP stage score system
(RP-SSS) appeared to be readily applicable to different subtypes of RP . In particular, our
group [ 10] recently applied the RP-SSS to the clinical and morphological features of USH2A
related retinal degeneration. The USH2A severity score was reliably correlated with patient
age as well as with several morphologic and functional parameters of retinal disease [10].
In a previous study by Mcguigan et al. [ 11], EYS patients showed typically RP features.
Although a residual foveal cone function could still be detected into the fourth, ﬁfth or
sixth decade of life, the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and EZ width progressively
decreased. Determining the degree of retinal atrophy involving retinal pigment epithe-
lium (RPE)/photoreceptors in the macular region may be particularly relevant either for
visual prognosis or for the effects of potential treatments rescuing photoreceptors. An
estimate of the area of central macular atrophy (CRA) can be obtained by the automatic
determination of the area of sub-RPE illumination (SRI). The SRI identiﬁes bright areas
of increased light transmission beneath the RPE, indicating RPE/outer retina atrophy,
averaged over a circular area of 5 mm around the fovea by the automated spectral domain
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) software. In age-related macular degeneration,
the SRI was used to measure the area of RPE and outer retinal atrophy (RORA), established
from an international consensus by Guymer et al. [12].
The aim of the present study was to determine the disease severity stage in a cohort
of ArRP patients carrying pathogenic variants in the EYS gene and to estimate, in these
patients, the extent of CRA by using the automated SRI measurements.
2. Materials and Methods
This clinical study was performed in compliance with the ICH Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice, adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (1991) and was
approved by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board of the Catholic University
of Rome, Italy (protocol #8383/15).
After a detailed explanation regarding the study procedures, written informed con-
sents for clinical and molecular analyses were obtained from all the adult subjects or
relatives when the patient was a minor.
All the reported clinical data were retrospectively re-evaluated.
2.1. Subjects
We enrolled 17 patients (8 male, 9 female; mean age: 50.5 years.; SD: 14.7) affected
by RP due to variants in the EYS gene and followed at the Center for Inherited Retinal
Degenerations of Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli, IRCCS. All patients were evaluated
between November 2013 and December 2021 and met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) clinical and genetic diagnosis of EYS-related RP; (2) good cooperation in psychophysical
testing; (3) dioptric media clean enough to perform Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence
Tomography (SD-OCT). Exclusion criteria were the presence of: (1) concomitant ocular
(e.g., amblyopia, glaucoma) and systemic diseases; (2) poor cooperation in psychophys-
ical testing; (3) severe ocular media opacities. EYS-related RP diagnosis was conﬁrmed
through a genetic test and, whenever possible, a segregation analysis on available fam-
ily members was performed. Seven patients were homozygous and the remaining eight
were compound heterozygous for EYS variants. Molecular genetic data are reported in
Table 1. The pathogenic variants in the EYS gene were detected using the Next Genera-
tion Sequencing (NGS) technology. NGS was performed on a MiSeq personal sequencer
(Illumina, San Diego, CA), following the molecular and bioinformatic strategy that we
previously published [ 13,14]. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA)
(www.mrc-holland.com, (accessed on 1 December 2017) was also performed in one patientDiagnostics 2023 ,13, 850 3 of 12
using the Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000 sequencer, and revealed the presence of a deletion
in heterozygosity (c. (2135 _2204) _ (2351_2469) del) resulting in the loss of the exons 14
and 15. All variants identiﬁed were evaluated according to American College of Medical
Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines [ 15] with the help of the VarSome online tool
(https://varsome.com/, (accessed on 24 May 2022) [ 16]. Molecular genetic data for each
patient are detailed in Table 1.
2.2. Clinical Assessment and Functional Evaluation
All patients underwent a full ophthalmologic examination including detailed fam-
ily history, anterior segment biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, BCVA
measured with ETDRS charts, Goldmann visual ﬁeld using the V/4e target, SD-OCT
with measurement of the EZ extension, scotopic and photopic full-ﬁeld electroretinogram
(ERG) recordings and direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. All patients had a typical RP
phenotype. The data collected allowed the determination of the disease severity stage
of all enrolled patients according to the cumulative score (CS) and grade indicated by
Iftikhar et al [ 9]. Sub-groups of patients underwent a more detailed comprehensive electro-
functional study. A total of 12 out of 17 patients performed 30 Hz submicrovolt ﬂicker
ERG, (Retimax Advanced Plus, CSO, Scandicci, Italy)) with the assessment of response
variability and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), as already described in a previous article by
Falsini et al. [10].
Macular cone-mediated focal ERG (FERG) was recorded in 7 out of 17 patients using a
published technique [ 17–20]. Brieﬂy, FERGs were recorded monocularly in response to a
ﬂickering uniform red ﬁeld stimulus superimposed on an equiluminant steady adapting
background. Off-line discrete Fourier analysis quantiﬁed the peak-to-peak amplitude of
the response ﬁrst harmonic at 41 Hz.
2.3. Morphological Analysis Using Retinal Advanced Multimodal Imaging
All patients underwent advanced retinal analysis by SD-OCT using Zeiss Cirrus
5000-HD-OCT Angioplex, sw version 10.0, (CarlZeiss, Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA, USA).
In two patients, the advanced imaging was not possible due to unstable ﬁxation. A High-
Deﬁnition 5-Line Raster and a macular map (6 6 mm Macular Cube 512 128) were
acquired. In order to obtain the most reliable measurements, two independent operators
(M.C.S. and M.M.) measured the residual EZ extension on OCT horizontal scans using a
caliper, as previously described [ 21]. The agreement rate between the two independent
experts was equal to 89% (95% conﬁdence interval = 79–98%).
The EZ extension was determined by the retinal points where the temporal and nasal
EZ borders met the RPE becoming indistinguishable.
The Advanced RPE post-processing analysis was used to automatically determine
areas of sub-RPE illumination (SRI, measured in mm2) for increased light penetration
through atrophic OR, RPE and choriocapillaris, by means of the sub-RPE algorithm. An
automated SD-OCT software allowed detection of RPE atrophy in a 5 mm circular area
around the fovea. The SRI was used to measure the RPE and outer retinal atrophy (RORA),
as established in an international consensus by Guymer et al. [12].
RORA corresponds to a region of signal hyper-transmission into the choroid resulting
from the interruption of the RPE and OR and can be classiﬁed as complete and incomplete.
If the signal hyper-transmission into the choroid does not exceed an area of 250 microns,
RORA is deﬁned as incomplete (iRORA). RORA is complete (cRORA) when this value is
higher and corresponds to geographic atrophy (GA).
2.4. Statistical Analysis
We analyzed both right and left eyes. In this study, we considered only the results from
the right eyes for statistical analysis in order not to overestimate the statistical signiﬁcance
andp-values. Analysis from right and left eyes showed substantially similar results.Diagnostics 2023 ,13, 850 4 of 12
The data were analyzed by parametric or non-parametric analyses, depending on their
distribution. Both Pearson’s correlation and Spearman rank order correlation were used.
ERG data were log transformed to better approximate normal distribution. A pvalue of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

4. Discussion
The present study was designed to evaluate the severity stage of EYS disease patients,
as determined by the RP-SSS [ 9], and to estimate the area of CRA (from a standardized
method measuring the area of SRI in the macula) in relation to disease stage in the same
patients. The results of our study showed a correlation between the stage of RP and the age
and disease duration of patients. Such correlation revealed a severe stage at a relatively
early age of 45, supporting the severity of the molecular pathology underlying this sub-type
of RP .
Previous scientiﬁc investigations concerning structure and function correlations in
patients with biallelic mutations in the EYS gene support a rapid disease progression as
a function of time. McGuigan et al. [ 11] evaluated a cohort of 15 patients by chromatic
static perimetry, SD-OCT, and enface autoﬂuorescence imaging reporting anomalies in
the outer nuclear retinal layer of the central retina with some exceptions in the foveal
region. Furthermore, an analysis of the perifoveal region as a function of time showed that
photoreceptor structural loss was followed by dysmorphology of the inner retina and loss
of retinal pigment epithelial integrity. Based on their results, arRP caused by EYS mutation
was considered a more rapidly progressive disease compared to other gene mutations
causing arRP , such as the USH2A and MAK variants. Some authors suggested that a
different phenotype and progression in EYS-related retinal degeneration could be related
to the speciﬁc EYS genotype [ 26,28–31]. However, due to the limited number of patients
examined, such correlations could not be veriﬁed and conﬁrmed in the present study.
An important ﬁnding of this study is represented by the correlation of CRA area
with RP-SSS. The increase in CRA area was positively correlated with a greater RP-SSS
value, indicating an increase in the disease severity. In addition, it was correlated inversely
with the EZ width and positively with LogMAR acuity. Although other morphological
predictor factors of atrophy progression in OCT analysis have been reported [ 32], RORA is
the result of multiple information on the status of EZ, outer segments of the photorecep-
tors, interdigitation zone and RPE-Bruch’s membrane complex [ 33–35]. Recently, RORADiagnostics 2023 ,13, 850 9 of 12
assessment has been considered not only for early diagnosis but also as a prognostic factor
of AMD progression [ 21]. Indeed, the possibility of evaluating the progression of central
atrophy growth could become a key element in the evolutionary study of RP . Currently,
the detection of RORA ﬁnds an important application in eyes with age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) [ 36]. Automated identiﬁcation of RORA using machine learning
has also been described [ 37]. Extending the present approach to inherited retinal diseases
would be important for predicting their natural history. Indeed, we already demonstrated
in other studies how the SRI area, as a result of RORA, was correlated with the disease
severity stage in patients with USH2A-related Retinitis Pigmentosa [10].
Although EYS-related RP represents a rare disease, our sample did not include a high
number of patients. This constitutes a limitation to our study. Further comparative studies
using a similar methodology would be desirable in order to identify useful diagnostic and
prognostic criteria to study the natural history of the EYS-related disease, which is currently
still difﬁcult to predict.
In our study population, no correlations were found between the stage of the disease
and the ERG, both focal and 30 Hz ﬂicker ERG. Although in most cases the degenerative
evolution of the disease proceeds from rod to cone photoreceptors and the cone loss
is considered a secondary occurrence, the obtained ERG data show that a severe cone
dysfunction may be present early in EYS patients. Similar to what is observed in patients
with USH2A mutations [ 20], our study patients showed severely abnormal 30 Hz ﬂicker
ERG and fERG, well in advance of other cone-related visual tests, such as visual acuity. This
ﬁnding supports an early involvement of cone driven responses in EYS-related RP . This
hypothesis is in agreement with McGuigan et al. [ 11] who reported the constant presence
of anomalies in the outer nuclear retinal layer of the central retina in a cohort of patients
with EYS mutations, except in some where only the foveal region appeared still preserved.
It is important to specify that, although the number of patients who underwent a FERG
in this study was 7 out of 15, all patients had abnormal ERG responses. Additionally, 30
Hz Flicker ERG showed markedly reduced responses in all patients and was unrelated to
other parameters. This latter ﬁnding indicates that in our patients a severe extrafoveal cone
dysfunction was present, too.
Although no treatments are available for EYS-related RP , many novel therapeutic
approaches could represent potential therapeutic options in the future [ 38]. In view of the
above, the correct identiﬁcation of useful outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness
of potential therapies in upcoming clinical trials is a goal to be achieved. Studies in this
regard are still few and more will have to be conducted to strengthen our hypothesis.
The data reported in this study qualiﬁes the SRI in the detection of iRORA as an
important parameter concerning the rate of progression of retinal degeneration caused by
biallelic mutations in the EYS gene.
5. Conclusions
This research has provided new information concerning patients affected by Retinitis
Pigmentosa associated with EYS gene mutations. We used a known RP severity score and
validated techniques for the detection of morpho-functional correlations. In particular, in
EYS-related RP the severity score was positively correlated with the central retinal atrophy,
the central visual acuity and the EZ extension and increases with age and disease duration.
In contrast, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the disease, functional measures did not
appear sensitive enough to reveal staging-based changes. Given the small size of our
sample, further studies concerning the natural history of this kind of retinal dystrophy
would be desirable.Diagnostics 2023 ,13, 850 10 of 12
