Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous disorders with substantial
socioeconomic impact. In this cohort study, we tried to address the genetic characteristics and epidemiology of IRDs in Taiwan.Totally, 312 families with IRDs were identi ﬁed and recruited and genetic testing was performed via probe capture-based NGS
targeting 212 IRD-related genes. Statistical analysis was based on the proband of each affected family. Disease-causing genotypes
were identi ﬁed in 178 families (57.1%). ABCA4 variants were the most common cause of disease in this cohort (27 families, 15.2%),
whereas CYP4V2 variants were the most common cause for the single phenotype —Bietti ’s crystalline dystrophy (12 families, 3.8%).
Some variants such as ABCA4 :c.1804C>T, CYP4V2 :c.802-8_810delinsGC, and EYS:c6416G>A were population-speci ﬁc disease-causing
hotspots. Probands affected by ABCA4 ,RPGR ,RP1L1 , and CEP290 sought medical help earlier while patients affected by EYSand
CYP4V2 visited our clinic at an older age. To evaluate the representativeness of our cohort in the genetic epidemiology of IRDs in
Taiwan, our demographic data were compared with that of the total IRD population in Taiwan, obtained from the National Health
Insurance Research Database. This is currently the largest-scale, comprehensive study investigating the genetic characteristics and
epidemiology of IRD in Taiwan. These data could help patients and caregivers to adopt precision genomic medicine and novel genetherapies in near future.

INTRODUCTION
Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of phenotypi-
cally and genotypically heterogeneous disorders with variablepenetrance and severity. The prevalence of monogenic IRDs isapproximately 1 in 2000 individuals, affecting more than twomillion people worldwide
1. There are more than 20 IRD
phenotypes, including rod-dominated diseases, cone-dominated
diseases, generalized retinal degenerations, and vitreoretinopa-
thies. Irreversible progression toward blindness due to IRDsigni ﬁcantly affects quality of life. Severe visual impairment leads
to reduced mobility and independence, posing heavy psycholo-gical and economic burden
2.
However, diagnosing IRD is challenging due to its genotypic
and phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, many IRDs have
overlapping clinical features. For example, retinitis pigmentosa(RP), the most common form of IRD, demonstrates primary rod celldysfunction followed by cone cell degeneration and the clinicalpresentation may overlap with that of Leber congenital amaurosis(LCA) and even cone-rod dystrophy (CRD)
3–5. Conversely, the
same gene can encode different phenotypes. For example, IRDs
with underlying ABCA4 mutations have been associated with
inherited macular degeneration, fundus ﬂavimaculatus, general-
ized choriocapillaris dystrophy, and rapid-onset chorioretinopa-thy6–10. To further complicate diagnosis, many IRDs present
similarly in late stages, with features such as severe retinal cell
death, extensive atrophy of the retina, and irreversible visual loss.
In the era of precision medicine and gene therapy, genetic
diagnosis for patients with IRD has become increasinglyimportant. Up to 271 genes listed on RetNet ( https://sph.uth.
edu/retnet/ ) have been associated with IRDs. These genes have
varying inheritance patterns and encode a wide spectrum ofproteins, including structural and transmembrane proteins,proteins for phototransduction, and visual cycle proteins
11.
Identifying the disease genotype of IRDs is thus important for
subsequent therapeutic strategies.
Previously, patients with IRD were underdiagnosed because of
genotypic/phenotypic heterogeneity and the high cost of genetic
diagnosis12. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technol-
ogies have been applied for genetic diagnosis, allowing timelyand cost-effective detection of novel or rare variants in patientswith IRDs; NGS has thus become the mainstream technique for
reﬁning diagnosis of IRDs by exploring the disease-causing genes.
Large-scale genetic screening studies for IRDs have beenpreviously performed in several countries
13–20. However, a similar
nationwide investigation for IRDs has not been done in Taiwan.
Taiwan is an isolated and highly developed island in East Asia,
and is one of the most densely populated areas worldwide.
Ethnically, Taiwan is relatively homogeneous; the population iscomposed of indigenous Taiwanese Austronesians and Han
Taiwanese that immigrated from continental East Asia21. Taiwan
is geographically isolated, and is relatively homogenous geneti-cally. To explore the nationwide epidemiology and geneticaspects of IRDs in Taiwan, our team, granted by National TaiwanUniversity Hospital, started performing genomic surveillance for
IRD patients using a capture-based NGS platform in 2015. In
addition to providing clinical and molecular surveillance for our

medical centers in Taiwan. In this project, the Taiwan inherited
retinal degeneration project (TIP), we aim to report the detailed
clinical and genetic characteristics of IRD patients in Taiwan. In thisstudy, we present the TIP database with respect to the molecular
characteristics and genetic epidemiology of IRD and highlight the
representativeness of the entire IRD-affected population in Taiwanbased on statistical data from the national health insurance.
RESULTS
Phenotypic characteristicsThe average age at recruitment of the probands with IRD from 312
families was 43.2 years (range 6 months to 83 years old). Onehundred and sixty-three probands were female (52.2%). Disease-
causing variants were identi ﬁed through panel-based NGS testing
in 178 probands with a diagnostic rate of 57.1%. The clinical
diagnosis of every proband was evaluated collectively by genotype
and phenotype. Approximately two-thirds of the patients werediagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP, n=205, 65.7%), the most
prevalent phenotype in our cohort, followed by macular dystrophy
(MD, n=39, 12.5%), cone dystrophy/cone-rod dystrophy (CD/CRD,
n=19, 6.1%), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA, n=16, 5.1%),
Bietti ’s crystalline dystrophy (BCD, n=12, 3.8%), occult macular
dystrophy (OMD, n=5, 1.6%), retinoschisis (RS, n=4, 1.3%),
choroideremia ( n=2, 0.6%), familial exudative vitreoretinopathy
(FEVR, n=2, 0.6%), Alstrom syndrome ( n=2, 0.6%), and others ( n
=6, 1.9%) (Table 1and Supplementary Data 1).
Inheritance patterns and family history
Of all IRD cases, 217 (69.6%) were sporadic (i.e., patients with a
negative family history of IRD) and 95 (30.4%) were inherited (i.e.,
patients with a positive family history of IRD). The number of RS
and choroideremia probands with a positive family history (FH)
was higher than that of patients with a negative FH (Table 1). The
age at onset and at examination of the probands are shown in
Fig. 1a, b, respectively. There were no signi ﬁcant differences
between positive and negative FH in each clinical phenotype.However, on average, probands with LCA, RS, choroideremia, FEVR,
and Alström syndrome tended to have an earlier age of onset and
visited our clinic at a younger age, whereas patients with RP
tended to visit our clinic at an older age (Fig. 1b). The distribution
curve of the age at diagnosis was shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.The inheritance patterns were primarily based on the genetic
results and then we con ﬁrmed the pattern with pedigree for each
family. For those cases without de ﬁnite genetic diagnosis, the
inheritance patterns were imputed from clinical observation.When classi ﬁed according to inheritance pattern, 64.6% (115/178)
harbored gene variants with autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance,
whereas 26.4% (47/178) had autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance
and 9.0% (16/178) had X-linked (XL) inheritance (Fig. 2). Among
these three inheritance patterns, patients with XL inheritance hadthe highest chance of positive FH (56.3%, 9/16) compared to the
AD (34.0%, 16/47) and AR (33.0%, 38/115) inheritance patterns.
Genetic characteristics
To identify the disease-causing variants in patients with IRD, 212
IRD-related genes were sequenced by capture-based NGStechnology. Disease-causing variants were identi ﬁed in 178
probands, corresponding to a detection rate of 57.1% (178/312).
Figure 3a lists all the disease-causing genes in ﬂuencing at least
two or more probands in our cohort. Among the analyzed genes,biallelic variants of ABCA4 were the most frequent disease-causing
variants (27/178, 15.2%), responsible for diseases in 27 families,
including 17, 8, and 2 families with STGD, RP, and CRD,
respectively. Other genes responsible for more than 2% of theprobands in our cohort included EYS, USH2A, CYP4V2, RPGR,
PRPF31, RP1L1, PROM1, CEP290, BEST1, RP1 , and GUCY2D . These 12
genes were responsible for 118 families (118/178, 66.3% of thegenetically diagnosed probands) in our cohort. The disease-causing genes of probands with positive or negative FH were
analyzed further (Fig. 3b, c). Among them, probands with PRPF31
(6/7, 86%), RPGR (4/8, 50%), CHM (2/2, 100%), CRB1 (2/3, 67%),
PRPH2 (2/3, 67%), RLBP1 (2/3, 67%), RS1(2/3, 67%), and BEST1 (2/4,
50%) mutations tended to have a known family history. Except
CRB1 and RLBP1 , most of these genes followed an AD or XL
inheritance pattern. Conversely, probands diagnosed with ABCA4,
USH2A, RP1L1, PROM1, PR1, GUCY2D, RDH12, HK1, MYO7A, RPE65,PRPF3, RP2, SNRNP200 ,o rTTLL5 mutations had mostly negative FH
(>70% of proband in each gene).
Novel and common disease-causing variants
We further distinguished the novel variants from previously
reported pathogenic variants in disease-causing genes. In ourcohort, 68 novel variants were identi ﬁed from 76 probands,Table 1. Demographic Data of TIP Cohort.

(Supplementary Table 1). Among the genes analyzed, USH2A ,
identi ﬁed in nine RP probands, was responsible for the most novel
variants in our cohort (9/76, 11.8%), followed by EYS(6/76, 7.9%),
ABCA4 (5/76, 6.6%) and. CEP290 (5/76, 6.6%). In probands with
positive FH. PRPF31 and RPGR , which follow AD and XL inheritance
patterns, respectively, were the major disease-causing genes with
novel variants, and were responsible for 3 and 4 RP families,
respectively. On the contrary, USH2A was responsible for most
novel variants in probands with negative FH, and was identi ﬁed ineight probands with RP. Supplementary Table 2 lists the high-
frequency variants identi ﬁed in our cohort. We further evaluated
the variants of affected genes enriched in our cohort by
comparing them with public datasets, including the Taiwan
Biobank and East Asian population data in The GenomeAggregation Database (gnomAD). Several variants in our present
cohort are disease-causing hotspots, including ABCA4: c.1804C>T ,
CYP4V2: c.802-8_810delinsGC, and EYS:c6416G>A, which were
identi ﬁed in more than ten probands in our cohort.
Relationship between genotype and age of onset
Among the 12 disease-causing genes each affecting more than
3% of our cohort, patients affected by ABCA4, RPGR, RP1L1 , and
CEP290 sought medical help at an earlier age, whereas patients
affected by EYS and CYP4V2 visited our clinic at an older age
(Fig. 4a). Further, patients affected by ABCA4, RPGR , and PRPF31
had an earlier age of onset, whereas patients affected by CYP4V2
had a relatively later age of onset (Fig. 4b).
Representativeness for total IRD population in Taiwan
To evaluate the representativeness of our cohort in the genetic
epidemiology of IRDs in Taiwan, we searched the National Health
Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan for the current
number of patients diagnosed with hereditary retinal disorders(ICD-10-CM codes, H31101, H3550, H3552, H3553, and H3554) and
their age distribution. In all, 6674 patients with ICD-10-CM codes
were identi ﬁed from the Taiwan NHIRD, indicating that our
present cohort (312 families and 587 patients approached)
accounted for nearly 9% of all IRD patients in Taiwan. A

IRD population as a whole, based on the NHIRD, is shown in Fig. 5.
The age distribution of our cohort showed a similar trend
compared to the total IRD population in Taiwan. However, ingeneral, our patients seemed to be a little younger than the IRDpopulation overall. In reviewing the pedigrees in our cohort, we
noticed that within an affected family, younger members were
more motivated to seek medical advice.DISCUSSION
IRD is an important cause of visual impairment, especially in
working age adults, thus signi ﬁcantly impacting the quality of life
of both patients and their families. IRD can be inherited in
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked patterns.
However, rare mitochondrial and digenic forms of retinaldystrophies have also been characterized. Currently, more thana b c

npj Genomic Medicine (2021)    16 Published in partnership with CEGMR, King Abdulaziz University270 causative genes have been identi ﬁed for IRD, and more are
continuously being explored22–25. Panel-based NGS or WES can be
effective tools for detecting IRD-causing mutations. In recent
years, a variety of NGS studies have employed target panel-based
NGS approaches to sequence the exons of known IRD genes fortheir patients18,26–28. These studies usually report a success rate of
50–60% in identifying the disease-causing mutations in patients
with IRD. To increase the ability in detecting disease-causingvariants, DNA fragments were generated with a peak length of800 bp in library preparation. The main advantage of longer DNA
fragments was that longer reads may align to the DNA regions
which contained repetitive sequences by performing paired-endsequencing, such as ORF15 region of RPGR . In addition, we
captured the entire genomic sequence of common disease-
causing genes, such as ABCA4 ,CEP290 ,USH2A , and annotated the
intronic variants by SpliceAI algorithm
29.
In this study, we present our cohort (patients recruited during
July 2015 and June 2019) of the Taiwan Inherited retinaldegeneration Project (TIP), based on patients visiting National
Taiwan University Hospital, a tertiary medical center. To maximize
this project ’s representativeness of the real-world distribution of
IRD in Taiwan, we recruited all patients referred to us with aclinical diagnosis of IRD who agreed to genetic testing. In this 48-
month period, a total of 312 families and 587 patients with IRD
were approached. To eliminate the quantitative bias from multipleaffected members within a single family, only the 312 probands
(theﬁrst affected patient of a given family to visit our clinic) were
included for statistical analysis in this study. Our results revealed adiagnostic rate of 57.1% using a capture-based NGS approachtargeting 212 IRD-related genes. This diagnostic rate is similar to
previous reports from other countries, and may be further
enhanced by whole exome or whole genome sequencing infuture studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-
scale, comprehensive study characterizing the genetic aspects and
epidemiology of IRD in Taiwan.
Taiwan is a continental island in East Asia and has a relatively
homogeneous population. Taiwan was periodically connected to
mainland Asia during the Pleistocene glacial period
30; conse-
quently, the Taiwanese population shares many genetic variants
with mainland Asian populations. Furthermore, Taiwan also has
close contact with neighboring countries, such as Japan, South-east Asian countries, and Oceania countries. Comparing thedistribution of disease-causing genes in our cohort to those of
data from similar studies in China and the US
13,20, we found that
all three cohorts shared some common disease-causing genessuch as EYS, USH2A, ABCA4, RPGR, PRPF31 , and CEP290 . Some
genes, such as PROM1 associated with RP, CRD, and Stargardt
disease, as well as CYP4V2 associated with Bietti crystalline
dystrophy, were frequently found in our cohort and the cohortfrom China but were less frequent in the US cohort. In our cohort,
disease-causing PROM1 variants were found in ﬁve families (2.8%
of all solved families) with diverse RP, CRD, and MD phenotypes.
CYP4V2 variants were responsible for an even larger portion of our
cohort (12 families, 6.7% of solved families); all affected patientshad Bietti crystalline dystrophy, exclusively. Conversely, some
genes such as RHO, PRPH2 , and CRB1 that were rare in our cohort
were frequently seen in the US cohort.
Notably, ABCA4 , which was responsible for 27 families (15.2% of
solved families) in our cohort, was the single most commondisease-causing gene in the cohort, far exceeding other genes infrequency. This phenomenon mirrors the data from the US cohort
where ABCA4 was responsible for 17.3% of the cases
20. However,
the prevalence of ABCA4 was not as high in a Mainland China
cohort study published by Huang et al.13.ABCA4 variants are
known to be a major cause of Stargardt disease as well as some
autosomal recessive RP. However, macular dystrophy, includingStargardt disease, accounts for only 12.5% (39 of 312 probands) ofour cohort, which is much lower than 28.2% in the US cohort.
Furthermore, there were 3 disease-causing hotspots, each
detected in more than 10 probands of our cohort, including EYS:
c.6416G>A (p.Cys2139Tyr), CYP4V2 :c.802-8_810delinsGC, and
ABCA4 :c1804C>T (p.Arg602Trp). In prior studies, ABCA4 :c1804C>T
(p.Arg602Trp) was seldom reported as a common variant
10,31.A s
Taiwan is a relatively isolated island, in future studies, it may beworth investigating whether a founder effect exists among these
families, which could account for high prevalence of this variant
among our population. This is signi ﬁcant because novel therapies
emphasize the precise diagnosis of genetic variants.
IRD prevalence is believed to have been underestimated in the
past because a lack of effective treatment deterred patients fromseeking medical consultation. However, with the development of
new techniques for molecular diagnosis and novel therapies such
as AAV-mediated gene augmentation in recent years, the situationhas changed
32,33. In our study, comparison of patients with known
versus unknown family histories showed no difference in when
they ﬁrst became aware of visual disturbances and their timing of
seeking medical advice (Fig. 1). However, patients with certain
phenotypes such as LCA, RS, FEVR, and Alström syndrome,
obviously experienced symptoms earlier and thus visited the
clinic earlier. Notably, among the common disease-causing genes(>3% of our solved families), probands with EYS and CYP4V2
variants sought medical attention at an older age, whereas
probands with ABCA4 ,RPGR, RP1L1 , and CEP290 did so at a
signi ﬁcantly younger age. When recalling their age of symptom
onset, CYP4V2 probands had a signi ﬁcantly later onset compared
toABCA4 ,RPGR , and PRPF31 probands. This is reasonable when we
correlate the clinical phenotypes; CEP290 is related to LCA, RP1L1
is related to occult macular dystrophy (OMD), ABCA4 is related toFig. 5 Age distribution of TIP and Taiwan population. Age distribution of our cohort (TIP) and the Taiwan IRD population based on the

Published in partnership with CEGMR, King Abdulaziz University npj Genomic Medicine (2021)    16 Stargardt disease and severe forms of autosomal recessive RP, and
CYP4V2 is related to BCD. However, this may also indicate that RP
with different genotypes may have different courses of progres-
sion. Some studies have discussed the different prognoses ofindividual disease-causing genes for RP; patients with PRPH2
mutations had a relatively good prognosis34, whereas patients
with PRPF31 mutations had early macular involvement and central
vision loss, which is important for daily life35. We also found that
there was different prevalence of the disease-causing genesbetween patients with and without family history. Despite some
popular disease-causing genes that ranked high in both groups,
some genes may have quite different prevalence between the twogroups. For example, PRPF31 is the third popular disease-causing
gene in patients with positive family history while ranked 26
thin
patients without known family history. The uneven distribution
might provide scienti ﬁc clues for future studies such as exploring
the probability of de novo mutations for individual genes.
We initiated this study —the Taiwan Inherited retinal degenera-
tion Project (TIP) —to recruit IRD patients from multiple medical
centers in different areas of Taiwan. All patients were clinically andmolecularly diagnosed at a single referral medical center, the
Department of Ophthalmology, National Taiwan University
Hospital and Graduate Institute of Medical Genomics andProteomics, National Taiwan University, to eliminate possibledeviation among different settings and retinal specialists. In this
report of the TIP, we aimed to standardize the data-analysis
pipeline and to characterize the diversity of mutations in patientswith IRD in our cohort. To con ﬁrm the cohort ’s representativeness
of IRD in Taiwan ’s population as a whole, we also referred to the
population statistics from Taiwan ’s National Health Insurance
Research Database (NHIRD), which has records of medical visitsand ICD codes for every resident in Taiwan. The statistical results
showed that the patients included in our current cohort account
for 8.8% of currently diagnosed IRD patients in Taiwan. Figure 5
further con ﬁrms that the age distribution of our cohort follows a
similar trend as that of the total population with IRD in Taiwan
with a small left shift, indicating that our probands were slightly
younger than the general IRD population on average.
Our study has some limitations. First, the panel-based genetic
test predominantly targeted exons of 212 genes known to cause
IRD. It is possible that some currently undiagnosed families have
genetic variations in uncovered areas of these genes or variationsin novel uncovered genes. Secondly, information regarding
pedigrees and symptom onset largely depended on the patients ’
memories and may thus be erroneous, even though we tried ourbest to access more family members for accuracy. Third, becauseIRDs are rare disorders, it is statistically challenging to analyze the
different prognosis among different genotypes within the same
population due to the limited number of probands for eachgenotype in Taiwan. Further analysis may be possible in thefuture, as the project proceeds and more families are registered
and analyzed. Fourth, the judgement of family history could be
imperfect. For example, in our cohort, a signi ﬁcant majority of the
probands in autosomal dominant IRD group did not have family
history by their self-report. This may due to that the nuclear family
style has become the mainstream in current Taiwan society. Theprobands could be the only one kid in his/her generation withoutbrothers and sisters while the parents may be underdiagnosed
due to the lack of medical resource before. In some cases, the
incomplete penetrance of IRD-related genes may also play a roleto make the judgement even more dif ﬁcult. Finally, some patients
of IRD could be underdiagnosed. Therefore, the total number
calculated via NHIRD may be underestimated compared to the
reality. Despite these limitations, we believe that the presentresults are valuable. This is a large-scale study on the genetic
characteristics and epidemiology of IRD in Taiwan. Furthermore, as
regional differences are an important factor when consideringgenetic diseases, a better understanding of the geneticdistribution of IRD in Taiwan is crucial to incorporate novel gene
therapy in the near future.
In summary, this report of the Taiwan Inherited retinal
Degeneration Project presents the phenotype classi ﬁcation,
genetic characteristics, and related statistical analysis of 312
families with IRD. With these data, we hope to achieve better
understanding and care for patients with IRD, as well as provide
comparative data for IRD specialists worldwide. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale, comprehensive study
investigating the genetic characteristics and epidemiology of IRD
in Taiwan.
METHODS
Subjects
The present study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology,
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), and was approved by theResearch Ethics Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital (IRBNO.: 201408082RINC). Patients with IRD were recruited either from our out-patient clinic or from patients referred by other medical centers in Taiwanto our hospital (please see Acknowledgements for the list of medicalcenters).
From July 2015 to June 2019, 312 families with IRDs were identi ﬁed and
recruited consecutively into our TIP project. During a 48-month period, 587patients of IRDs in the 312 families were approached and the ﬁrst patient
of each family recruited into our project was regarded as the “proband. ”
This statistical analysis in this study is based on the proband of each
affected family to minimize the potential bias in genetic epidemiology. Forevery subject recruited, detailed ophthalmological examinations wereperformed, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity,electroretinograms, color fundus photography, optical coherence tomo-graphy, and fundus auto ﬂuorescence imaging to con ﬁrm the clinical
diagnosis of IRDs. A detailed medical history, including pedigree, wasobtained for every proband. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubesafter obtaining informed consent, and genomic DNA was extracted fromperipheral blood mononuclear cells using a DNA extraction kit (Gentra
Puregene Blood Kit, QIAGEN, Hilden, Mettmann, Germany).
Capture-based target enrichment followed by NGS
Using the genomic DNA, we performed genetic testing via a probe
capture-based NGS approach targeting 212 IRD-related genes (Supple-mentary Table 3). The test results, along with family history and clinicaldiagnosis, were used to evaluate the genotype and phenotype of IRDs.
DNA fragment libraries were generated by sonication (Covaris, Woburn,
MA, US). Fragmented gDNAs, with a peak length of 800 bp, were tested forsize distribution and concentration using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Qubit (Thermo Scienti ﬁc,
Waltham, MA, US). Libraries were generated using the TruSeq LibraryPreparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, US). Probe-based targetenrichment was then performed to target the transcripts of all 212 genesimplicated in retinal degeneration using the SeqCap EZ Hybridization andWash Kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, US). These 212 genes wereselected from the RetNet database ( https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/ ), OMIM
database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim ), and peer-reviewed pub-
lications (PubMed search queries: hereditary retinal dystrophy). All exons(including the 5 ′and 3 ′untranslated regions) with at least 100 bp ﬂanking
intron sequences of the 212 genes were de ﬁned as targeted regions,
which summed up as a 3.6 Mbp region (Table S3). In addition to capturingexons, we captured the entire genomic sequence, including both exonsand introns for some genes ( USH2A, OFD1, ABCA4, PRPF31 CEP290, RPGR,
GUCY2D, KCNV2, CNGB3, CNGA3, PRPF4, MYO7A, RPGRIP1, RDH12, AIPL1,CNGB1, NRL, SPATA7, FAM161A, RPE65, PDE6A, PDE6B, BBS10 , and BBS1 )t o
increase the ability of detecting structural variants and possible intronic
disease-causing variants. Paired-end sequencing was achieved using
Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq 550 (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, US). Thecapture probes of 212 IRD-related genes were designed using NimbleDe-sign ( https://design.nimblegen.com/ ) and produced by Roche NimbleGen
(Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, US). The mapped reads (GRCh37/hg19)reached a mean coverage depth of 135.4-fold, and 95.4% of targetedregions were covered by 20 or more reads.T.-C. Chen et al.

The paired-end reads were analyzed for mapping to the human reference
genome (Feb. 2009 GRCh37/hg19) using BWA-MEM (version 0.7.12). Picard
(version 1.54) was then used to perform data conversion, sorting, and
indexing. Variant calling for single- nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small
insertions/deletions (INDELs) was conducted using GATK package software(version 3.4). ANNOVAR 2016Feb01 was use d to annotate the allele frequency
of variants based on ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ), Genome
Aggregation Database (gnomAD, https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org ), NHLBI-
ESP 6500 exome project ( http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/ ), 1000 Genomes
project ( http://www.1000genomes.org/ ), Exome Aggregation Consortium
projects (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org/ ), 69 Genomes Data (CG69,
http://www.completegenomics. com/public-data/69-genomes/ ), Kaviar Geno-
mic Variant Database ( http://db.systemsbiology.net/kaviar/ ), dbSNP Build 147
(avsnp147, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp ), and Taiwan Biobank ( https://
taiwanview.twbiobank.org.tw/index ), which contains 1517 community-based
healthy subjects; pathogenicity prediction was performed using SIFT,PolyPhen-2 HDIV, PolyPhen-2 HVAR, LR T, MutationTaster, FATHMM, Mutatio-
nAssessor, PROVEAN, VEST, MetaSVM, MetaLR, MCAP, CADD, and DANN. Theintronic variants were analyzed with SpliceAI algorithm
29,w h i c hi s
implemented on TAIGenomics , a genomic analysis cloud ( https://
taigenomics.tw ). The integrative genomics viewer (IGV) was then used to
visualize the sequence mapping.
Variant ﬁltering
The data analysis pipeline is shown in the Supplementary Fig. 2. Brie ﬂy,
after variant annotation, ﬁltering was applied to decrease the number of
false positive results by removing synonymous variants and variants
with allele frequencies higher than 5% in either one of the population
databases. Variants were comprehensively interpreted by Varsomewhich followed the American College of Medical Genetics andGenomics (ACMG) guidelines
36,37. Every variant identi ﬁed in our cohort
was searched with literature search engines —Mastermind ( https://
www.genomenon.com/mastermind/ ) and variant2literature ( https://
variant2literature.taigenomics.com ) for previous literature. Sanger
sequencing was used to con ﬁrm the nucleotide change of variants
that met the above criteria.
Comparison with the epidemiology data of the total
population
The epidemiology database of all IRD patients in Taiwan was obtained
from Taiwan ’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD),
which is maintained by the National Health Research Institutes of Taiwan.The NHIRD data extracted for the present study included inpatient,
outpatient, and pharmaceutical claims, and disease diagnoses coded
according to the International Classi ﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-
10-CM). Data of patients diagnosed with hereditary retinal disorder (ICD-10-CM codes, H31101, H3550, H3552, H3553, and H3554) between January2016 and December 2017 were retrieved. In all, 6674 patients with theseICD-10-CM codes were identi ﬁed from the Taiwan NHIRD.
Statistical analysis
The results in this study are shown as mean ± standard error of mean.
Student ’st-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc
multiple comparisons were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,IL, USA).
