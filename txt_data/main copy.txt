Purpose: To describe the largest, most phenotypically and genetically diverse cohort of patients with
inherited retinal disease (IRD)-related Coats-like vasculopathy (CLV).
Design: Multicenter retrospective cohort study.
Participants: A total of 67 patients with IRD-related CLV.
Methods: Review of clinical notes, ophthalmic imaging, and molecular diagnosis from 2 international centers.
Main Outcome Measures: Visual function, retinal imaging, management, and response to treatment were
evaluated and correlated.
Results: The prevalence of IRD-related CLV was 0.5%; 54% of patients had isolated retinitis pigmentosa
(RP), 21% had early-onset severe retinal dystrophy, and less frequent presentations were syndromic RP, sectorRP, cone-rod dystrophy, achromatopsia, PAX6 -related dystrophy, and X-linked retinoschisis. The overall age of
patients at CLV diagnosis was 30.7 /C616.9 years (1 e83). Twenty-one patients (31%) had unilateral CLV, and the
most common retinal features were telangiectasia, exudates, and exudative retinal detachment (ERD) affectingthe inferior and temporal retina. Macular edema/schisis was observed in 26% of the eyes, and ERD was observedin 63% of the eyes. Fifty-four patients (81%) had genetic testing, 40 of whom were molecularly solved. Sixty-six
eyes (58%) were observed, 17 eyes (15%) were treated with a single modality, and 30 eyes (27%) had a combined
approach. Thirty- ﬁve eyes (31%) were “good responders, ”42 eyes (37%) were “poor responders, ”22 eyes (19%)
had low vision at baseline and were only observed, and 12 eyes (11%) did not have longitudinal assessment.
Twenty-one observed eyes (62%) responded well versus 14 (33%) treated eyes. Final best-corrected visual acuity
was signi ﬁcantly worse than baseline ( P¼0.002); 40 patients (60%) lost 15 ETDRS letters or more over follow-up
in 1 or both eyes, and 21 patients (31%) progressed to more advanced stages of visual impairment.
Conclusions: Inherited retinal disease erelated CLV is rare, sporadic, and mostly bilateral; there is no gender
predominance, and it can occur in diverse types of IRD at any point of the disease, with a mean onset in the fourthdecade of life. Patients with IRD-related CLV who have decreased initial visual acuity, ERD, CLV changesaffecting 2 or more retinal quadrants, and CRB1- retinopathy may be at higher risk of a poor prognosis.

Coats disease (CD) is a rare ocular disorder characterized by
abnormal retinal vasculature, manifesting as telangiectasia,aneurysms, hemorrhages, or intraretinal and subretinal
exudation.1It has a prevalence of approximately 0.025%
and it is an idiopathic, isolated disorder. However, Coats-like vasculopathy (CLV) can appear associated with sys-temic diseases such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dys-
trophy or rare genetic syndromes, including syndromic or
non-syndromic retinal diseases.
2e4Both are believed to
occur due to abnormal endothelium and pericytes that lead
to defects in the blood-retinal barrier, exudation, vessel
tortuosity and dilation, retinal ischemia, and detachment.5,6Coats disease is typically described as a unilateral con-
dition, affecting more male than female patients in latechildhood or adolescence.4,7Patients often have decreased
visual acuity and less frequently strabismus, pain, and
xanthocoria.3Coats disease can be classi ﬁed according to
the severity of its presentation, ranging from telangiectasiaonly to total retinal detachment (RD) and glaucoma.8
Similar to other retinal vasculopathies (i.e., diabeticretinopathy and retinal vein occlusion), CD initiallydevelops in the retina, but it can affect the eye as a whole
in advanced disease stages, when ischemia-led neo-
vascularization compromises the ciliary angle and iris, and

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a diverse group of
mostly monogenic conditions that commonly manifest as a
degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithe-
lium cells. They include diverse phenotypes, such asearly-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD), rod-cone
dystrophy (also known as “retinitis pigmentosa ”[RP], the
most common type), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), isolatedcone, and macular dystrophies, among others.

Approximately 1 in 2000 individuals are affectedworldwide, and the age of onset is widely variable,comprising congenital to late-adulthood disorders.

Theﬁrst case of CLV affecting a patient with an IRD was
described in 1956 in an individual with RP.12Since then,
multiple case reports have described patients with RP andCLV retinal changes, and it is estimated that the latter
affect 1% to 5% of patients with RP.13e15Previous
studies have characterized RP-related CLV in smaller co-horts, with a focus on CRB1 -associated IRD.15e18In this
study, we describe the largest cohort of patients with
IRD-related CLV to date and discuss its management,prognosis, and genotype-phenotype correlations.
Methods
This study was a retrospective case series of patients who attended
Moor ﬁelds Eye Hospital (London, UK) and Hôpital Ophtalmique
Jules-Gonin (Lausanne, Switzerland) and were diagnosed with an
IRD and CLV changes. Patients were identi ﬁed through a clinical
database search. Some of the terms queried were “pigmentosa, ”
“exudative, ”“dystrophy, ”“exudates, ”“vasoproliferative, ”“telan-
giectasia, ”“coat, ”“coats, ”“coats-like, ”“degeneration, ”“inheri-
ted,”“Leber, ”“vasculopathy, ”and “proliferative. ”Informed
consent was obtained from all patients. Ethical approval was pro-vided by the local ethics committee, and the study honored thetenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patient electronic healthcare records and paper notes were
reviewed to retrieve relevant clinical information. The diagnosis ofIRD was made by retinal examination, ocular, medical and family
history, multimodal retinal imaging, and when available, electro-
retinography and genetic testing. All patients had an unremarkablebirth history and were born full-term.
Age of disease onset corresponds to the age at which visual
symptoms were ﬁrst noticed by the patients or caregivers. Snellen
visual acuities were converted to logarithm of the minimum angleof resolution (logMAR) for statistical analysis purposes. As perconventions,
19,20count ﬁngers vision was given a value of
logMAR 1.98, hand motion vision was given a value
of logMAR 2.28, light perception vision was given a value oflogMAR 2.7, and no light perception vision was given a value
of logMAR 3.0. Patients were categorized using the World
Health Organization (WHO) visual impairment criteria thatdeﬁne no or mild visual impairment as best-corrected visual acu-
ity (BCVA) <0.48 (6/18, 20/60), moderate impairment as BCVA
>0.48 and <1.0 (6/60, 20/200), severe impairment as BCVA
>1.0 and <1.3 (3/60, 20/400), and blindness as BCVA >1.3.
Ultra-wide ﬁeld pseudocolor, auto ﬂuorescence (green), and
ﬂuorescein angiogram imaging were taken with Optos (Optos PLC,Dunfermline, UK), and macular optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans were obtained with Spectralis (Heidelberg Spectralis,Heidelberg Engineering, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany). Genetic
testing was performed using panel-based, targeted next-generation
sequencing, whole exome sequencing, or whole genomesequencing. When appropriate and available, parental blood sam-ples were taken to con ﬁrm segregation of proposed variants. The
pathogenicity of previously unreported variants was determined by
implementing the criteria of the American College of MedicalGenetics.

GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software) was used for
statistical analysis. The threshold of signi ﬁcance was set at
P<0.05. Ttests and linear regressions were used to assess
parametric variables. Welch ’sttest variation was used when the
sample sizes were signi ﬁcantly different.
Results
Prevalence, Demographics, Phenotype, and
Disease Onset
Two patients had IRD-related CLV among 890 patients with IRD
in the Swiss center and 65 among approximately 10 000 patientswith IRD at Moor ﬁelds Eye Hospital, resulting in a prevalence of
approximately 0.5% of CLV in patients with IRD.
Sixty-seven patients from 67 families were included in this
study ( Table S1 , available at www.aaojournal.org ). Ethnicity was
available in 47 patients (70%); 26 patients (39%) were White, 14
patients (21%) were Asian, 6 patients (9%) were Black, and 1
patient (1%) was of mixed race. Thirty-one patients were male(46%), and 36 patients were female (54%). Positive family historywas reported by 29 patients (43%), and 12 patients mentioned
consanguinity in their family (18%), with parents being ﬁrst
cousins.
Thirty-six patients had RP (54%, 11 having dominant RP; 23
having recessive RP; and 2 having X-linked RP), 14 patients (21%)
had EOSRD, 10 patients had syndromic RP (15%, 2 had Usher
syndrome [USH] type 1, 5 had USH type 2, 1 had Bardet-Biedlsyndrome, 1 had Hallervorden-Spatz disease, and 1 had un-
known etiology), 2 patients (3%) had sector RP, 2 patients had
CORD, 1 patient had achromatopsia, 1 patient had PAX6 -related
dystrophy, and 1 patient had X-linked retinoschisis.
The age of visual symptoms onset was 12.2 /C612 years (mean
/C6standard deviation; median, 8, range, birth to 55 years), and the
mean age of IRD diagnosis was 22.0 /C617.1 years (median, 16
years, range, 2 e61 years). Age at baseline visit was 27.5 /C616.4
years (median, 26 years). Eighteen patients were children (27%,
age<16 years), and 49 patients (73%) were adults.
Forty patients (60%) were found to have CLV and IRD at their
ﬁrst visit, 25 patients (37%) developed CLV after 8.3 /C68.6 years
of follow-up (median 5, 0.5 e39), and 2 patients (3%) were referred
with a diagnosis of CLV and were subsequently found to have anIRD. The overall age of CLV diagnosis was 30.7 /C616.9 years
(median, 29 years, 1 e83 years).
Visual Acuity
Initial BCVA of those without CLV changes at baseline (n ¼26,
26.1/C618.6 years) was 0.6 /C60.7 in the right eye (OD) and 0.9 /C6
0.9 in the left eye (OS), whereas those with CLV at baseline had
1.1/C60.9 in the OD and 1 /C61 in the OS (n ¼41, 29.9 /C614.7
years). There was a signi ﬁcant difference for the OD ( P¼0.01),
but not for the OS (0.87). Baseline age was not signi ﬁcantly
different between those with and without CLV changes ( P¼0.5).Ophthalmology Volume 130, Number 12, December 2023
1328At baseline, 36 patients had no to mild visual impairment (14
without CLV, age 9 e78 years), 20 patients had moderate visual
impairment (7 without CLV, 8 e42), 2 patients had severe visual
impairment (a 5-year-old without CLV and a 12-year-old), 8 pa-
tients were blind (2 without CLV, 11 e42), and 1 was an infant.
Asymmetric BCVA (difference <0.3) at the initial visit was seen
in 20 patients with CLV (50%) and 7 patients without CLV (28%).
Thirty-nine eyes with CLV (35%) had low vision (BCVA >1.3)
when CLV was ﬁrst noticed.
There was no signi ﬁcant association between age and
BCVA in patients with CLV at baseline ( P¼0.3) or patients
without CLV ( P¼0.1) when analyzed cross-sectionally at
their initial visit.
Those with CLV development over follow-up had a BCVA of
1.3/C61 in the OD and 1.1 /C61 at the time of CLV onset (age 33.2
/C619.8 years). Considering the affected eyes only, there was a
signiﬁcant difference between BCVA at baseline versus at CLV
onset ( P¼0.0003).
Forty-four eyes (39%) had CLV changes affecting the macula,
51 (45%) had them peripherally, and in 18 eyes (16%) this wasunclear due to advanced disease, history of CLV complications at
baseline, or poor visibility of the posterior pole. Baseline BCVA
for those with CLV affecting the macula was 1.2 /C60.8 OD and
OS versus 0.5 /C60.6 OD and 0.6 /C60.8 OS in those with the
periphery affected only (signi ﬁcantly different, P¼0.005 OD
and 0.05 OS).
Clinical Examination, Fundus Imaging, and
Fluorescein Angiography
Forty-nine patients (73%) developed lens opacities at a mean age
of 34.6 /C615.7 years, from congenital to 69 years of age.
Sixty-four eyes (57%) had macular OCT scans, and 29
eyes (26%) had macular edema/s chisis during follow-up. All
patients had varied degrees of retinal pigmentary changes,vessel thinning, optic disc pallor, and macular involvement
(Fig 1 Aa n dB ) .
Twenty-one patients had unilateral CLV changes (31%, 15 OD
and 6 OS) and 46 patients had bilateral, asymmetric disease (69%),
giving a total of 113 eyes affected with CLV and IRD. The
maximum time until the contralateral eye showed CLV signs was 7years ( Fig 1 C). Twenty eyes (18%) had telangiectasia only, 6 eyes
(5%) had exudative RD only, 1 eye (1%) had retinal exudation
only, 2 eyes had a vasoproliferative tumor only (2%), and the
remaining 84 eyes (74%) had a combination of the previousangiomatous malformations, retinal exudates, and hemorrhages.Fifty-four eyes (48%) had up to 2 quadrants affected (mostly
inferior and temporal), and 59 eyes (52%) had 3 or more quadrants
involved.
Seventy-one eyes (63%) developed exudative RD at or after 1.3
/C64.3 years of CLV diagnosis (0 e20): 6 total RD, 26 inferior, 5
posterior, 4 temporal, and the remaining eyes had a combined
location (e.g., inferotemporal, inferior, and posterior).
Fifteen patients had ﬂuorescein angiography (22%); 9 pa-
tients had poor peripheral perfusion, 6 patients showed neo-
vascularization with le akage, and 1 patient had a
vasoproliferative tumor-like mass ( Fig 1 D). Patient ID 60 had
participated in an RPE65 gene supplementation clinical trial
(NCT02781480) 7 years before the development of CLV in
the treated eye, noticed due to an acute drop in vision ( Fig 2 ).
He received 0.4 ml of low-d ose AAV-OPTIRPE65 in the OD.
His overall response to the inter vention had been positive until
this episode, with no complica tions. He subsequently received
Luxturna in the contralateral eye 4 years after the ﬁrst surgery,and fundus examination revealed no CLV until his most recent
visit.
Management and Longitudinal Analysis
Sixty patients (90%) had longitudinal assessments, with a meanfollow-up time of 15.6 /C613.1 years (0 e57) and mean age of 44.4
/C620.3 years (median, 43) at the latest visit. Final BCVA was 1.8
/C61 logMAR OD and 1.5 /C61.1 OS, with a signi ﬁcant difference
between baseline and follow-up BCVA ( P¼0.002). A signi ﬁcant
difference was also found in ﬁnal BCVA between patients with
macular and peripheral CLV ( P<0.0001 and 0.0003).
Forty patients (60%) lost 15 ETDRS letters or more over
follow-up in 1 or both eyes. Twenty-one patients (31%) progressedto more advanced WHO categories of visual impairment over
follow-up, 15 of whom became blind (22%, age 10 e75 years).
Sixty-six eyes (58%) were observed, 9 (8%) had laser treatment
only, 5 (4%) had cryotherapy only, 2 (2%) had pars plana vitrec-tomy (PPV), 1 (1%) had a scleral thinning and draining procedure,
and 30 (27%) had a combined approach. Eyes that maintained
BCVA <1.3 at the latest assessment were classi ﬁed as “good
responders, ”and those that received treatment and had a ﬁnal
BCVA >1.3 were labeled as “poor responders. ”
Observation Only. This group had a baseline age of 30.3 /C619
years, follow-up time was 16 /C614.2 years, and the age at the most
recent assessment was 45.6 /C621.6 years.
Twenty-two eyes had low vision at baseline (33%, BCVA
>1.3), 21 eyes (32%) were good responders, 13 eyes (20%) were
poor responders, 9 eyes (14%) did not have follow-up assessments,and 1 patient was nonverbal (2%, Table S2 , available at
www.aaojournal.org ). The eyes that did not respond well to
observation were left untreated for reasons such as older caseswhere minimally invasive intravitreal medication was notapproved/available yet, pregnant/nursing patients, functioning
contralateral eye, and patient ’s choice.
The complications seen in this subgroup were exudative RD (33
eyes), vitreous hemorrhage (VH) (7 eyes), intraretinal or retro-hyaloid hemorrhages (3 eyes), neovascular glaucoma (5 eyes),
open-angle glaucoma (4 eyes), acute angle-closure glaucoma (2
eyes), band keratopathy (2 eyes), and ocular in ﬂammation (epis-
cleritis and anterior uveitis, 2 eyes; Table S2 ).
One Therapeutic Method Only. Patients treated solely with
laser, cryotherapy, PPV, or a scleral thinning and draining pro-cedure were combined for analysis (n ¼17). Their age at baseline
was 27.9 /C611.6 years, they were followed for 18.1 /C613.9 years,
and their age at the latest assessment was 48.8 /C618.4 years. Four
eyes had serial procedures. Nine eyes had between 1 and 5 sessionsof focal or panretinal photocoagulation; 4 eyes had only 1 sessionof cryotherapy, and the remaining eye had 3 sessions; 1 eye had 2
PPVs, 1 eye had 1 PPV, and the remaining eye had 1 scleral
thinning procedure with drainage of subretinal ﬂuid.
Ten eyes (59%) had poor response to treatment, with decreased
vision, development of exudative and/or tractional RD (10 eyes),
glaucoma (6 eyes, neovascular and/or acute angle-closure glau-coma), VH (5 eyes), and chronic uveitis post-treatment (1 eye).Four eyes (24%) had good response, with resolved RD, inactive
telangiectasia, and absorbed hemorrhages; 2 eyes (12%) did not
have follow-up assessments, and 1 patient (6%) was nonverbal(Table S2 ).
Combined therapy. Patients treated with more than 1 approach
(n¼30) had a mean age of 24.2 /C610.3 years at baseline and were
followed for 15.7 /C612.7 years, having a most recent age of 42.2 /C6
17.2 years.Daich Varela et al/C15Coats-like Vasculopathy in IRD
1329The treatments were as follows: laser and cryotherapy (6 eyes);
laser and anti-VEGF (3); radioactive plaque and laser (4); laser,
cryotherapy, and PPV (4); cryotherapy and anti-VEGF (3, Fig 2 );
laser, anti-VEGF, and cryotherapy (3); radioactive plaque, laser,and anti-VEGF (1); cryotherapy, PPV, and anti-VEGF (1); laser and
retinopexy (1); cryotherapy and PPV (1); laser, anti-VEGF, and
orbital steroid injection (1); laser, anti-VEGF, and intravitreal ste-roids (1); and cryotherapy, laser, and scleral buckle (1). Ten eyes hadserial procedures, up to 13 anti-VEGF injections (mean, 2.8 /C63.3;
median, 2) and 9 sessions of laser (2.1 /C62.1, median, 1).
Ten eyes (33%) had good response to treatment, with visual
acuity maintained and resolved neovascularization, hemorrhages,and RD. Nineteen eyes (63%) had poor response, with decreased
vision, development of exudative and/or tractional RD (19 eyes),
VH (15 eyes), glaucoma (5 eyes, neovascular and/or open-angleglaucoma), uveitis (2 eyes), retinal and subretinal hemorrhage (2

1330eyes), and phthisis (3 eyes); and 1 eye (3%) did not have follow-up
assessments ( Table S2 ).
Good Responders versus Poor Responders. Thirty- ﬁve eyes
(31%) were good responders, 42 eyes (37%) were poor responders,22 eyes (19%) had low vision (BCVA >1.3) at baseline and were
only observed, and 12 eyes (11%) did not have longitudinal
assessment. Among the good responders, 8 patients were White, 4
patients were Black, and 4 patients were Asian.
Among the eyes with low vision at baseline (n ¼39), 22 (56%)
were observed with poor response, 10 (26%) had poor response to
various treatments, 6 (15%) did not have follow-up assessments,and 1 was observed with good response.
Excluding the patients with low vision at baseline who were
observed, those without longitudinal evaluation, and the nonverbal
infants, 77 eyes remain. Of these, 43 eyes were treated (56%) and34 were observed (44%). Twenty-one (62%) observed eyesresponded well versus 14 (33%) treated eyes. Dividing the latter
into single (n ¼14) versus combined (n ¼29) treatments, 4 eyes
(29%) responded well in the single treatment group (3 laser and 1
cryotherapy), compared with 10 (34%) in the combined subgroup(2 laser and anti-VEGF; 1 laser and brachytherapy; 1 laser, anti-VEGF, and brachytherapy; 1 laser and retinopexy; 1 laser,
anti-VEGF, and orbital ﬂoor steroids; 1 laser, anti-VEGF, and
cryotherapy; 1 laser, cryotherapy, and PPV; 1 anti-VEGF,cryotherapy, and PPV; 1 anti-VEGF and cryotherapy). Six eyes
with serial procedures were good responders (43%) compared with
8 with poor response (57%).
Given the multiple combinations and small numbers of each, it
is not possible to assess whether one treatment was better than the
rest. Although a larger percentage of observed eyes were good
responders compared with treated, the severity and nature of thepresentation may have been different between groups. Two-thirds

1331of the eyes that responded well to observation had only 1 or 2
quadrants affected compared with one-third of the treated eyes. Themilder presentation of the observed eyes may have led to the choice
of management and ultimate response.
The phenotypes in the good responders group (n ¼35) were
5 eyes from patients with EOSRD, 6 eyes with USH, 1 eye withHallervorden-Spatz disease, 1 eye with sector RP, and the
remaining eyes with RP. Four pa tients with RP, 2 patients with
EOSRD, and 1 patient with CORD did not have follow-up as-sessments, and the remaining patients with EOSRD, RP, USH,Bardet-Biedl syndrome, achromatopsia, PAX6 -related dystro-
phy, CORD, and retinoschisis were in the poor responders group
(n¼42).
There was not a signi ﬁcant difference regarding age of CLV
onset between good (32.3 /C618.7) and poor responders (31.2 /C6
14.0, P¼0.4). The BCVA at CLV onset was signi ﬁcantly better
for the good responders (0.5 /C60.6) than for the poor responders
(0.95/C60.8,P¼0.001). Six eyes in the good responders group
had unilateral CLV (17%) versus 8 in the poor responders group
(19%). Nine eyes developed exudative RD in the good re-sponders group (26%) versus 35 eyes in the poor respondersgroup (83%). Twenty-one eyes in the good responders group
(60%) had CLV changes affecting 1 or 2 quadrants of the retina
compared with 17 eyes (40%) in the poor responders group. Thetime between CLV onset and treatment was not signi ﬁcantly
different between groups (1.3 /C63.0 years for good responders
vs. 1.7 /C66 for poor responders, P¼0.8).
Molecular Genetics
Fifty-four patients (81%) had g enetic testing; 40 had positive
results, 9 had negative results, 1 result was inconclusive, and in
4 only the affected gene was recorded, without details of thevariant. Eleven patients had disease-causing variants in CRB1, 5
inRHO ,4i n USH2A ,2i n PRPF31 ,RPGR ,NRL,a n d MYO7A ,
and the remaining genes were seen in only 1 family each ( Fig 3 ,
Table S1 ).
Fifty different variants in 21 genes were present in our cohort;
29 were missense, 8 were nonsense, 5 were splice-site alterations, 5
were small deletions and duplications, 2 were large deletions, and 1was deep intronic. Forty-one variants (82%) were present in theliterature, and 9 variants (18%) were previously unreported
(Table S1 ). Among the latter, 3 were classi ﬁed as pathogenic, 5
were classi ﬁed as likely pathogenic, and 1 was classi ﬁed as a
variant of uncertain signi ﬁcance.
The good responders group included eyes from patients with
USH1, USH2, CRB1 -retinal dystrophy, RHO- ,USH2A -,PDE6B -,
EYS-,PRPF8 -,RP1-,FLVCR1 -, and PANK2 -RP. Three eyes with
RHO -RP and 3 eyes with USH2 were poor responders versus 3 and
4 good responders, respectively.
Forty-two eyes with autosomal recessive and X-linked RP and
EOSRD had follow-up assessments and did not belong to thegroup with poor baseline VA that was only observed; 13 eyes
corresponded to patients with CRB1- retinopathy, and 29 eyes were
notCRB1 -related. Of those caused by variants in CRB1 , 12 were
poor responders (92%) and only 1 was a good responder, whereasamong those not CRB1- related, 16 were good responders and 13
were poor responders (45%). No signi ﬁcant differences existed
between the CRB1 - and not CRB1 -related groups regarding age at
CLV (26.9 /C68.7 years versus 30.3 /C612.5 years, respectively, P¼

Discussion
This study presents the largest and most diverse cohort of
patients with IRD-related CLV to date. The different
vascular lesions, management, and longitudinal evaluationare detailed, providing valuable information about thenatural history, prognosis, and genetics of this disorder
(Table S2 ).
The prevalence of CLV in this study (0.5%) was less than
reported by Khan et al
24in 1988 (1.2% e3.6%). This may be
associated with the wide availability of multimodal imaging,
allowing early diagnosis of IRD and discrimination betweendifferential diagnoses, or to a more thorough understanding
and extended sample size of IRD.
Unlike isolated CD,3in IRD-related CLV we found an
equal male and female incidence, a minority of patients hadunilateral disease (31%), and the mean age of onset was in
the fourth decade of life, with a wide range of onset (1 e83
years). These characteristics are in keeping with thosedescribed in previous small case series and are reinforced in
this larger, genetically and phenotypically diverse
cohort.

Figure 3. Pie chart representing the most common genes found in the
cohort. Fifty-four patients (81%) had genetic testing; 40 had positive re-sults, 9 had negative results, 1 showed inconclusive results, and in 4 pa-tients only the affected gene was recorded, without details of the variant.
Eleven patients had disease-causing variants in CRB1, 5i n RHO ,4i n
USH2A , and 2 in PRPF31 ,RPGR ,NRL , and MYO7A . The remaining
genes ( PRPF8, GNAT, GUCA1A, RP1, RS1, PAX6, KLHL7, GUCY2D,
FLVCR1, EYS, PANK2, RPE65, CDH3, NR2E3, andPDE6B ) were seen
in only 1 family each and are not represented in the pie chart. Furtherinformation about the variants and demographics can be found in Table S1
(available at www.aaojournal.org ).Ophthalmology Volume 130, Number 12, December 2023
1332Of note, we saw only 1 affected family member despite
43% of the patients reporting a family history of IRD. It hasbeen postulated that IRD-related CLV may relate to a
speciﬁc gene(s) or variant(s) that could be inherited, but the
fact that it affected only 1 family member makes it apossible IRD complication instead of a unique type of IRDand moreover, that we have such a broad range of under-
lying genotypes in our cohort.
15,24,26
Fifty-six patients (84%) had mild-moderate visual
impairment at baseline and 18 patients (27%) had adult-
onset IRD; thus, poor initial VA and early onset do not
appear to be necessary risk factors to develop CLV. Thiswas also seen in previous cohorts, in which patients with
good initial VA and adult presentations still presented with
CLV during follow-up.15,18Our study has expanded the
phenotype of IRD-related CLV, previously restricted toEOSRD and RP, to CORD, macular dystrophy, achroma-
topsia, and sector RP, indicating that a clinical association
(i.e., generalized peripheral retinal vessel thinning) is notevident.
The most common CLV lesion in our cohort was a
combination of telangiectasia, RD, and exudates, corre-sponding to CD stages 2 and 3.
3,8These stages are the most
commonly described in IRD-related CLV14,27and were also
the most frequently seen in a large study of isolated CD.8
Exudative RD was frequent in this study, affecting 63%
of the eyes and mostly the inferior retina. This prevalence
and location are consistent with previous reports.14,15,18
Macular edema or schisis was present in 26% of eyes, a
percentage similar to that of patients with IRD without
CLV changes.28There is a wide variability in the
literature regarding macular cystic changes in CLV, beingabsent in some case series or present in a smaller, similar,
and larger percentage than the one seen in this
study.14,15,18,29One quarter of the eyes in this study had
VH (27 eyes), a larger subset than in isolated CD.9,30
Shields et al associated the lack of retinal
neovascularization with the low incidence of VH in theircohort;30thus, it is possible that the ischemia in IRD-
related CLV triggers a different mechanism to cause new
vessels and subsequent hemorrhages.31
Coats-like vasculopathy is a severe complication of IRD
that often decreases visual acuity. This was seen by
comparing the baseline VA of patients with and without
CLV, by differentiating between those with macular andperipheral CLV, by contrasting VA of the same patients
before and after CLV onset, and by noticing a signi ﬁcantly
different baseline and latest VA. Patients with CLV in theposterior pole have a worse visual prognosis than those with
peripheral lesions. One third of the patients (31%) pro-
gressed to more advanced WHO categories of visualimpairment over follow-up, and 22% became blind. Thispercentage is consistent with previous cases of IRD-related
CLV,
15,18whereas in isolated CD the condition is mostly
unilateral and patients maintain good vision in 1 eye.29
The prevalence of glaucoma (20% of eyes) and
vasoproliferative tumors was similar to previous
reports.29,30,32
The cohort in this study includes participants diagnosed
before intravitreal medications were frequently used. Morethan half of the eyes (66, 58%) were observed, 22 eyes due
to poor initial function. Observation is generally advised ineyes with asymptomatic disease or advanced stage with poor
visual prognosis.8Among those with preserved visual
function at baseline, 48% responded well to observation,which was a percentage similar to that seen in isolatedCD.
9The largest percentages of good responders in our
cohort were found in the observation and combined
therapy groups; therefore, it appears that tailoring themanagement to the type and location of vascular lesion is
key for a favorable prognosis. Current trends show that
intravitreal medication may result in a better outcome thancryotherapy or laser alone.
9,29In this study, only 10
patients (15%) received anti-VEGF and 1 patient received
a concomitant intravitreal steroid injection, compared with19 patients (28%) who received cryotherapy and 23 patients(34%) who received photocoagulation. Future work imple-
menting more intravitreal medications in these patients will
be useful to determine their suitability in IRD-related CLV.
On the basis of the ﬁndings of our cohort, factors
possibly predictive of poor response and prognosis include
decreased initial VA, development of exudative RD, CLVchanges affecting more than 2 quadrants of the retina, and
CRB1- retinopathy. There were no signi ﬁcant differences
regarding age of CLV onset, laterality of disease, timebetween diagnosis and treatment, or non-White race. In
isolated CD, non-White race, diffuse and superior telangi-
ectasias, and exudation have been found to be associatedwith poor prognosis.
8
There are several hypotheses explaining why CLV
changes occur in IRD, related to hyperpermeable vasodila-
tion, hypoxia secondary to subretinal exudation, and chronicischemia due to arteriolar attenuation.15A hypoxic state
caused by tissue loss and subsequent vascular narrowing
also has been described as a possible trigger for CLV.33,34
The appearance of CLV in diverse types of IRD in this
cohort somewhat challenges these theories, because the
retina functions in nearly opposite ways in RP comparedwith a macular dystrophy or achromatopsia. Analternative/overlapping explanation is that free radicals
produced by misfunctioning retinal cells,
35known
disruptors of homeostasis and key in the development ofDR,36also may play a part in the pathophysiology of
IRD-associated CLV. Future possible clinical trials for
IRD using antioxidants may be of help in determiningwhether the incidence of CLV decreases.37,38
Study Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study are the large number of patients
with this rare complication of IRD, their diverse phenotype,
genotype, and ethnic background, and the multicenter na-
ture. Its limitations include its retrospective nature, incom-plete data for some individuals, and nonstandardized
methods throughout the centers and periods of time these
patients were evaluated. It is also likely that indications forvarious treatment modalities were not standardized, but
therapeutic strategies were a combination of availability as
well as physician and patient preference.Daich Varela et al/C15Coats-like Vasculopathy in IRD
1333Conclusions
This article describes the largest, most phenotypically and
genetically diverse cohort of patients with IRD-related CLV to
date. Retinal appearance, disease extent, complications, man-
agement, and genotype-phenotype correlations are detailed.Inherited retinal disease erelated CLV is a rare complication,
affecting less than 1% of patients with IRD. It is sporadic,mostly bilateral, does not have a male predominance, and can
occur at any point in the disease, with a mean onset in ourcohort in the fourth decade of life. Coats-like vasculopathy can
occur in diverse types of IRD and commonly appears as tel-
angiectasia, RD, and exudates. Patients with IRD-related CLVwho have decreased initial VA, exudative RD, CLV changesaffecting 2 or more retinal quadrants, and CRB1- retinopathy
may be at greater risk of poor prognosis.
