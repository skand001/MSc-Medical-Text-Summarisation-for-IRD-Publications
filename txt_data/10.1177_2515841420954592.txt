Introduction
Worldwide, approximately one in 1000 people are affected with genetic eye disease.
1 In the United 
Kingdom, one in 2500 children under the age of 1 year are diagnosed as blind or severely visually impaired with an estimated 33% having a genetic basis.
2 Genetic eye disorders affect individuals of all 
ages and encompass a broad spectrum of disease including developmental eye defects, corneal and reti-nal dystrophies, and hereditary optic  neuropathies, 
with both nonsyndromic and syndromic forms. These rare diseases can affect all parts of the eye including the adnexa, ocular muscles, anterior chamber and posterior segment. They can be iso-lated, only affecting the eye, or found in association with systemic features, forming part of a syndrome. Developmental eye defects include microphthal-mia, anophthalmia and ocular coloboma (MAC), anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataracts, primary congenital glaucoma, retinal dysplasia and optic nerve hypoplasia. Inherited retinal disorders (IRDs) are a broad group of nonprogressive and progressive sight loss conditions characterised by a retinal degeneration. These include Leber congeni-tal amaurosis (LCA), severe early onset retinal dys-trophies, congenital stationary night blindness, achromatopsia, cone and rod dystrophies, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular dystrophies. Together IRDs affect 11 per 50,000 children and are the commonest cause of blindness among work-ing age adults in the United Kingdom.

All inheritance patterns are represented for heredi-tary eye disorders, the vast majority of cases being caused by genetic defects involving a single gene. Mutations range from single nucleotide substitu-tions and insertions/deletions to whole gene or chro-mosomal rearrangements. Although digenic and multiallelic cases have been reported,
4,5 there 
remains little evidence for this being a significant cause of disease. Similarly, although environmental factors have been found to contribute to certain ocu-lar maldevelopment phenotypes, this is a small pro-portion.

Abstract: Genetic eye diseases affect around one in 1000 people worldwide for which the 
molecular aetiology remains unknown in the majority. The identification of disease-causing 
gene variant(s) allows a better understanding of the disorder and its inheritance. There is now 
an approved retinal gene therapy for autosomal recessive RPE65-retinopathy, and numerous 
ocular gene/mutation-targeted clinical trials underway, highlighting the importance of 
establishing a genetic diagnosis so patients can fully access the latest research developments 
and treatment options. In this review, we will provide a practical guide to managing patients 
with these conditions including an overview of inheritance patterns, required pre- and post-
test genetic counselling, different types of cytogenetic and genetic testing available, with a 
focus on next generation sequencing using targeted gene panels, whole exome and genome 
sequencing. We will expand on the pros and cons of each modality, variant interpretation 
and options for family planning for the patient and their family. With the advent of genomic 
medicine, genetic screening will soon become mainstream within all ophthalmology 
subspecialties for prevention of disease and provision of precision therapeutics.

There is considerable genetic and phenotypic het-erogeneity, and in some cases it can be extremely difficult to attribute a particular disease-causing gene unless molecularly confirmed, as this also has implications for future treatments and generations. With the first approved gene therapy for the IRDs caused by biallelic variants in the RPE65 gene,
12 
and several more genetic-based treatments emerg-ing, it is paramount that patients have access to the appropriate genetic testing. In this review, we pro-vide guidance on current and future practices for genetic testing of Mendelian eye disorders, how to interpret results and guide genetic counselling.
How to identify patients who may benefit 
from genetic screening?
Family history and inheritance patterns
A detailed clinical history and examination is of key importance to determine the likely aetiology of an eye disease. In suspected genetic eye disease, the clinical findings should guide which molecular investigations/genetic testing is most suitable to ascertain the possible cause. Hence, the dissection of disease features, onset, progres-sion and severity of symptoms for all affected family members, detailed pregnancy/birth his-tory, family history and consanguinity are key aspects. For example, an infant presenting with congenital cataract is less likely to be suffering from an inherited form if the mother developed an intrauterine infection with rubella during early pregnancy. The family history can help to deter-mine the inheritance pattern of Mendelian dis-ease such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked or mitochondrial. Examination should involve a full ocular and systemic assess-ment, with accompanying investigations, such as neuroimaging or ocular ultrasound, and imaging, for example, anterior segment or retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF). Any clinical features should be recorded using human phenotypic ontology (HPO) to provide a standardised form of charac-terisation which may guide diagnosis and man-agement
13,14 (Box 1). Syndromic patients with 
congenital eye malformations and learning diffi-culties are likely to have a chromosomal abnor-mality
15 and may be best referred to a paediatrician 
or clinical geneticist for further review and inves-tigation. Establishing a precise molecular diagno-sis for any genetic eye disease can only be achieved through genetic testing and this will allow the 
Box 1. Importance of human phenotypic ontology (HPO). 
HPO was first established in 2007 to unify phenotype description reported in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 
database.16 Over 13,000 clinical phenotype features are regrouped and described in HPO (https://hpo.jax.org/app/), each with a 
unique identifier, in a ‘parent-child’ structure. An example of a small part of this structure is as follows:
•  HP:0000478 Abnormality of the Eye
° HP:0012372 Abnormal eye morphology
 HP:0000589 Coloboma
 HP:0100887 Abnormality of globe size
° HP:0012373 Abnormal eye physiology
 HP:0012632 Abnormal intraocular pressure
 HP:0000501 Glaucoma
It is important to note HPO encompasses individual clinical features which are then regrouped into one or more disease(s), it 
can help to study the link with other pathologies and their genetic association.17 To apply HPO, the most specific terms based 
on its definition (and not on its name) can be chosen to describe the observed clinical features, with the help of the website browser. The absence of some clinical features (i.e. investigated and not observed) can also be reported. The HPO description 
will be then understandable by healthcare professionals and researchers, who work in close collaboration to solve the 
molecular diagnosis of genetic eye disease patients. A list of HPO terms helps to identify the relevant genes/panels that need to be screened to aid diagnosis. If genetic testing reveals a variant(s) in a gene associated with a syndromic disorder, the HPO terms can help to confirm associated systemic phenotypes, expedite diagnosis and allow for the correct multidisciplinary team 
to be involved.C Méjécase, S Malka et al.

 clinician to stratify clinical risk in terms of prognosis, 
co-morbidities, assemble the correct multidiscipli-nary team and advise on possible research and  clinical trials that may benefit the patient.
Autosomal recessive disease. Autosomal  recessive 
disease inheritance is defined by the presence of 
biallelic variants on the genes located on an auto-some leading to disease. These variants range from point mutations, structural changes within a gene, or larger rearrangements/copy number variations encompassing several genes. Carriers of a single autosomal recessive pathogenic change are clinically unaffected. While there can be  variability between affected individuals, autoso-mal recessive inheritance does not discriminate between males and females, so both sexes are equally likely to be affected (Figure 1).
Parents of an affected patient with an autosomal 
recessive condition will usually either be unaffected carriers (with a single monoallelic pathogenic change) or be affected with the condition  themselves 
(with biallelic pathogenic changes). Consanguinity in parents increases the risk of autosomal reces-sively inherited conditions. In non-consanguineous families, autosomal recessive diseases are not often seen in multiple generations and cases will be

frequently simplex. For monoallelic carrier parent 
couples, there is a 25% risk with each pregnancy of the child inheriting the disorder, a 25% chance of the child being unaffected and not carrying either of the pathogenic mutations and a 50% chance of the child being an unaffected carrier.
All children of individuals affected with an autoso-
mal recessive condition will inherit one allele with a pathogenic change from their affected parent and will therefore be a carrier for the condition. If this child’s other parent is not affected, nor a car-rier of a pathogenic change in the same gene, then the child will not be affected with the condition. The risk of an affected patient’s child inheriting the autosomal recessive condition is small and depends on the population frequency of the path-ogenic variant. The risk of a patient with the dis-ease passing this onto their child is less than 1%. These risks increase if there is consanguinity between the parents or a positive family history of the same condition in the unaffected parent.
There are common pathogenic autosomal reces-
sive genes seen in inherited eye diseases. For exam-ple, Stargardt disease is a macular dystrophy with a prevalence of ~1:8000–10,000  predominantly 
caused by biallelic variants in ABCA4, which determine the onset and severity of the pheno-type.
18,19 Some disease-causing variants in the 
same gene can be associated with syndromic or nonsyndromic disorders, for example, USH2A  
biallelic variants can be associated with type II Usher syndrome in 85% of cases, characterised by vision and hearing loss, or nonsyndromic RP in 20% of RP cases.
20–22 Although the majority of 
bilateral microphthalmia/anophthalmia cases are due to dominant monoallelic mutations, homozy-gous and compound heterozygous loss-of- function 
variants are found in STRA6 and RAX.
6,23,24
Autosomal dominant disease. Autosomal domi-
nant inheritance is defined by a disease or trait caused by a single heterozygous variant affecting one allele of an autosomal gene. As with autoso-mal recessive inheritance, these changes can be point mutations, structural changes within a gene, or larger rearrangements/copy number var-iations which encompass several genes. Autoso-mal dominant inheritance also does not discriminate between males and females, so both sexes are equally likely to be affected (Figure 2).
Usually, individuals presenting with an autosomal 
dominant condition will have a family history in keeping with dominant inheritance. In cases where there is no clear family history of the eye condi-tion, this can be due to reduced/non-penetrance, variable expressivity or a de novo sporadic patho-genic change in the patient (see below). Each affected individual has a 50% risk for each preg-nancy of passing the mutated allele, and therefore the condition, to their child. Consanguinity of parents and family history of the unaffected parent is not relevant in determining inheritance risks in an autosomal dominant disorder.
Among the common pathogenic autosomal dom-
inant genes seen in genetic eye diseases is RHO, first described in 1990, mutated in approximately 30% of autosomal dominant RP cases, with the most common variant p.Pro23His.
25–29 OPA1 
variants account for approximately 65–75% of autosomal dominant optic atrophy, which can be associated with extra-ocular features.
30–32 PAX6 
variants can cause aniridia, which affects 1:40,000–100,000 births, leading to a variable degree of iris and foveal hypoplasia, nystagmus, cataract, glaucoma and corneal keratopathy.
33,34
X-linked recessive disease. X-linked inheritance 
relates to conditions that manifest as a result of a variant affecting a gene on the X-chromosome. Such conditions primarily affect men through the hemizygous pathogenic mutation, although female carriers can be asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic or display manifest signs of disease, for example, as seen in X-linked RP.
35 In women, lyonization 
occurs, commonly referred to as X-inactivation, meaning that one of the X chromosomes is active while the other is inactivated. This is a random pro-cess but if more healthy X chromosomes are inacti-vated in a carrier state, then a woman could be more clinically affected.
Due to the potential for female asymptomatic carri-
ers of X-linked recessive disease, it is possible for these conditions to appear to ‘skip’ generations on a pedigree through maternal carriers (Figure 3). A male patient with an X-linked recessive disorder will not pass the pathogenic mutation to any of his sons, but all of his daughters will be carriers. It is not possible for man to man transmission of an X-linked recessive condition. A female carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 50% risk of pass-ing the pathogenic mutation to her children, so each of her sons has a 50% risk of being affected and each of her daughters has a 50% risk of being a carrier. It is therefore important to consider the possibility of X-linked disease in sporadic male C Méjécase, S Malka et al.

cases or seemingly dominant pedigrees lacking man 
to man transmission.
Common X-linked recessive disorders in inher-
ited eye diseases include choroideremia, a rare chorioretinal dystrophy (with a prevalence of one in 50,000–100,000) caused by mutations in CHM, characterised by progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithe-lium (RPE) and choroid.
36 Variants in RPGR are 
the major cause of X-linked RP, which represents 8% of RP (with a prevalence of one in 3,000–7,000).
37,38 Lenz microphthalmia  syndrome is a 
X-linked disease characterised by cataracts and microphthalmia, associated with facial dysmor-phism, dental and cardiac defects, due to BCOR  
variants.
39
X-linked dominant disease. An X-linked domi-
nant condition is also caused by a pathogenic change on the X chromosome. Unlike X-linked recessive inheritance, a female’s healthy X chro-mosome does not compensate in an X-linked dominant case, so females and males can both be affected. Affected males of X linked domi-nant diseases are often more severely affected than heterozygous females and a number of such conditions are lethal in males during early life.

the phenotype is unknown. Anterior segment photograph of the (b) right and (c) left eye of the proband aged 9 years showing posterior polar cataracts.Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12

A male patient with an X-linked dominant disor-
der will not pass the pathogenic mutation to any of his sons, but all of his daughters will be affected. It is not possible for male to male trans-mission of an X-linked dominant condition. A female patient with an X-linked dominant disor-der has a 50% risk of passing the pathogenic mutation to her children, regardless of her child’s gender, so each child has a 50% risk of being affected. If a mother has had multiple miscar-riages of males, this can be an indicator of an X-linked dominant condition.
X-linked dominant disorders are very rare. One 
example is incontinentia pigmenti which is caused by pathogenic changes in the IKBKG gene. This condition usually only affects females, as it is only in rare cases that males survive.

Mitochondrial mode of inheritance
Mitochondrial inheritance does not obey the clas-sic rules of Mendelian genetics. The mitochon-drial genome comprises a circular ~16.5 kb DNA genome (mtDNA) with 37 genes present in each mitochondrion. The human egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the devel-oping embryo; hence, children can only inherit mtDNA mutations from their mother. The sever-ity of the disease is related to the number of mutated mitochondrial DNA in each cell. Mitochondrial disease can affect each generation of a family, with both sexes equally likely to be affected. Of note, fathers do not pass traits associ-ated with changes in mtDNA to their children. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)
41 
and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD)
42 are the most common mitochondrial 
eye diseases, which affect the respiratory chain complex. Kearn Sayre syndrome, characterised by pigmentary retinopathy, ophthalmoplegia and extra-ocular features such as deafness, cerebellar ataxia and heart block, is due to a mtDNA deletion.
43
Other inheritance patterns and complexitiesMosaicism occurs when cells within a single indi-vidual comprise two or more different genotypes. Somatic mosaicism is a form of mosaicism which occurs following postzygotic mutation.
44 Germline 
mosaicism is a form of mosaicism which involves the gamete cells (i.e. sperm or egg). In autosomal domi-nant cases, germline mosaicism can explain multiple affected siblings from unaffected parents.
45
A de novo mutation is a genetic change that occurs 
for the first time in an individual which is not pre-sent in the parents’ somatic cell DNA. This can be due to germline mosaicism in a parent or the mutation can occur in a fertilised egg during embryogenesis.
45
Uniparental disomy describes the phenomenon of an individual having two copies of a chromo-some, or part of a chromosome, from one parent without the equivalent copy from the other  parent.
8–11 This duplication is usually the result of 
a meiosis error46 and can be seen in one of two 
forms: uniparental heterodisomy, where the off-spring is genotypically identical to a parent at a locus having inherited both alleles carried by the parent, or uniparental isodisomy, where the off-spring inherits two copies of a single allele/locus from one parent.Parental exclusion means the absence of cosegre-gation between the child and parental genotypes with the most likely scenario being non-paternity or adoption of the affected child. This should be checked for during the genetic consultation and must be taken into account during the genetic analysis to help identify the disease-causing defects.
47
Variable expressivity means that a pathogenic variant may be associated with varying degrees of phenotypic severity within individuals of the same family, for example, in autosomal dominant non-syndromic microphthalmia and ocular coloboma (Figure 4).
Incomplete or reduced penetrance means that a 
pathogenic variant does not always result in the patient being affected with the disease.
48 For 
example, PRPF31, which causes autosomal dom-
inant RP, has been shown to exhibit variable expressivity and reduced penetrance, thus sever-ity of symptoms can vary significantly in affected relatives within the same family with some carri-ers being totally asymptomatic (Figure 5).
49
Pseudo-dominant inheritance describes families in which subsequent generations are affected by a recessive disorder and thus appear to follow a dom-inant inheritance pattern. Pseudo-dominance is more likely to occur in families with consanguinity or in recessive disorders where there may be a high carrier frequency of mutations (perhaps enriched in an isolated community or ethnicity).
50 Vaclavik and 
colleagues reported one consanguineous family where the father and two of his three children were affected with enhanced S-cone syndrome, the pedi-gree appeared autosomal dominant but genetic analyses identified a homozygous variant in NR2E3  
which cosegregated with the phenotype, revealing a pseudo-dominant inheritance.
50
Disease-onset, severity and prognosis can differ between individuals sharing the same disease-  
causing variants, known as inter- and intra- familial 
 variability. Environmental factors, genetic  modifiers 
or epigenetic influences may affect the clinical 
phenotype and explain the difficulty in establish-ing genotype-phenotype  correlations.
51,52 The 
field of epigenetics and genetic modifiers is the 
subject of much research, but clinically relevant discoveries are emerging, for example, in uveal melanoma, patients with a methylated EFS pro-motor have an increased risk of premature death compared with those with an unmethylated EFS Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12

promotor.53 Moreover, some studies report that 
CpG methylation influences mutation  occurrence.54 
A multiomic approach to studying disease will 
yield more information on inherited eye disorders than has previously been established, but as yet transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and epigenomics still remain as research-based tests.
55Genetic counselling (part 1) – informed consent and the role prior to genetic testingIf a genetic cause is suspected, the clinician should consider the following and discuss this with the patient and their family: (a) Would a molecular result reduce morbidity and mortality through established intervention or access to research? (b)

Provide an explanation for their symptoms, should 
they wish to know? (c) Help to determine the prog-nosis? (d) Guide family planning?
56 Genetic coun-
sellors assist clinicians by supporting families with their decision-making on proceeding with genetic testing (Table 1). Depending upon location, genetic counsellors can be registered professionals who must adhere to national guidelines and poli-cies, for example, the Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors (UK) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (USA). They will discuss the concept of genetics, DNA and genetic testing in appropriate language and level of detail for the patients and any relevant family members. The genetic counsellor will discuss a patient’s motivations for undergoing the genetic testing, such as (a) more accurate diagnosis and prognosis, (b) confirmation of inheritance pattern and risks to other family members and (c) potential eligibility for clinical treatment trials, while manag-ing a patient’s expectations. The genetic counsellor will draw a detailed pedigree diagram (genogram), facilitate conversations and counsel patients regard-ing any ethical concerns (Table 2) and apprehen-sions they may have. Counselling a patient on inheritance and family risks prior to genetic testing can be challenging, as many Mendelian hereditary eye disorders can be inherited by more than one

pattern of inheritance. Accurate discussions about 
risks to family members and future generations are sometimes only possible after a molecular diagnosis has been obtained (Figure 6). Following the discus-sion with the genetic counsellor, a patient must make an autonomous decision whether they wish to go ahead with a genetic test (if relevant and available).
Clinical genetic testing
Clinical genetic testing encompasses next genera-tion sequencing (NGS), and cytogenetic testing. Ultimately, retrieving a molecular diagnosis allows both patients and health care professionals to have a better understanding of the disease, establish genotype–phenotype correlations, which will inform clinical management and help determine a prognosis. Each country has its own framework for genetic testing. In the United Kingdom, all clinical-grade genetic testing must be performed within the approval of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). This is the only national accreditation body that is recognised by the government, which inspects and accredits clinical laboratories against internationally agreed standards. Molecular results are interpreted, veri-fied and reported by Health and Care Professional (HPCP) registered clinical scientists. As of October 2018, all genetic testing within NHS England was reconfigured with the aim to provide a single national testing network, with genetic tests undertaken by one of seven genomic labora-tory hubs.
57,58 To aid test selection, a National Genomic Test Directory for rare and inherited diseases has been curated detailing which test is available for each clinical indication (https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/). The Genomics England Panel app lists the genes included in the targeted gene panels.
59 All genes classified as ‘Green’ in Panel 
app have undergone review by a panel of experts and deemed to have enough evidence to be included on a diagnostic gene panel for a disease. In Europe, as in the United Kingdom, clinical genetic testing must be approved by the European co-operation for Accreditation (http://www.euro-pean-accreditation.org/) with some guidelines and advice provided by the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG, https://www.eshg.org/index.php?id=home) and the European Reference Network for Rare Eye Disease (ERN-RED, https://www.ern-eye.eu/).
60 In the United States, 
Clinical laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) provides validated laboratory procedures, while Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standardises tests.
60,61
For most ophthalmology conditions, sequencing of either a single gene, for example, PAX6 for aniridia in adults, or targeted gene panels, for example, genetically heterogeneous conditions such as retinal dystrophies, is typically recom-mended as the primary route of molecular analy-sis. For syndromic conditions alternative genetic testing methods such as genome wide copy num-ber variant (CNV) analysis by microarray may be more suitable.Table 1. Why pursue genetic testing?
Situation Aim
Diagnostic testing To establish a genetic diagnosis for an affected patient with no previously established individual or family 
result.
Confirmation testing To confirm a genetic diagnosis of an affected patient; this could be Sanger sequencing for a known 
genetic result of an affected family member or confirmation in an NHS diagnostic laboratory of a result 
found previously in research.
Carrier testing To study the genotype for an unaffected family member of a patient with a known pathogenic change. These tests are most commonly performed in family members of patients with an autosomal dominant gene with reduced penetrance, or for women who are at risk of carrying an X-linked disorder.
Predictive testing To study the genotype for asymptomatic relatives of affected individuals who are at risk of developing the condition themselves. Current UK guidelines are that asymptomatic children under the age of 16 should not undergo predictive testing for an adult onset disorder.
Familial segregation 
testingMight be useful for relatives of patients with an autosomal recessive disease, in order to confirm that two pathogenic mutations are in trans.C Méjécase, S Malka et al.

Table 2. Ethics issues associated with genetic screening.
Ethics issues
Presymptomatic 
testing in childrenA parent or guardian of a clinically unaffected child known to be at risk of a genetic eye disorder (e.g. a younger sibling of an affected patient) may wish to find out whether their child will develop the condition. 
This raises ethical concerns, especially for conditions where there is no treatment or management 
available and where the usual onset of symptoms is in adulthood. A parent making this decision on behalf of a child is removing the autonomy of the child to make its own decision. Genetic counsellor guidelines 
state that presymptomatic testing in children will only be offered in cases where there is a clinical need 
(e.g. treatment or prevention availability).
Presymptomatic testing in adultsIf a patient is currently asymptomatic or only very mildly affected, there is the potential for a negative psychological impact of a positive result. This decision needs to be balanced against the anxiety of 
inheriting a known diagnosis in a family and possible treatments or lifestyle adjustments.
Choice and expectationsIt is important that genetic testing is presented to a patient as a choice, rather than mandatory, just like any other procedure for which the risks and benefits must be discussed to arrive at informed consent. The 
clinician and genetic counsellor must make sure that a patient’s expectations regarding genetic testing and results are appropriately managed.
Informed consent (capacity and phrasing)The informed consent process should be a two-way conversation between a genetic counsellor and a patient. This can lead to ethical challenges regarding patients of various educational backgrounds understanding the relevant genetic principles.
a Some patients, such as those with severe learning 
difficulties, might not have the ability to provide informed consent for genetic testing which leads to ethical 
concerns about whether it is appropriate for family or medical professional to make a decision on their 
behalf in cases where there is no clinical benefit or treatment option available for the patient.
Identity An ethical issue that arises, particularly during family planning discussions, is that a patient might consider their diagnosis to form part of their identity. Therefore, discussions about ‘risks’ and reproductive options 
might have implications on a patient’s feeling of self-worth. Using appropriate language and a patient-led 
approach can help to minimise these problems, for example, a genetic counsellor may choose to talk about ‘chances’ of a patient’s child inheriting a condition rather than ‘risks’.
Blame/responsibilityA positive genetic result may lead carrier parents to feel a burden of responsibility for their child’s diagnosis. This is something that should be considered and discussed before genetic testing is offered to a family.
Family implicationsHaving a genetic diagnosis can lead to a patient learning of risks of other relatives developing the same disorder. Feedback of results needs to be handled carefully by a genetic counsellor and support should be offered to relevant family members. Family members can sometimes put pressure on an affected relative to pursue 
genetic testing so that they can learn of their individual risks. It is important that the affected patient is making an 
autonomous decision about genetic testing and is not merely responding to pressure from family members.
Unexpected paternity or family relationshipsWhen genetic screening occurs in multiple family members, this can reveal a lack of paternity or other unexpected familial relationships of which the patient and other family members may not be aware.
b
Social and legal implicationsIf a patient obtains a genetic diagnosis, there can be social and legal implications which should be considered prior to a decision being made about testing. These implications can be worrying for patients 
and include concerns about health/life insurance, driving and employment.
Data ownership, 
storage and privacySignificant ethical concerns, which are more relevant with the increase of whole exome/genome sequencing, relate to the data produced from genetic testing.
b Key questions to be considered by patients 
are: What data are stored? How and where is it stored? What methods are put in place to keep the data 
secure? Who has access to the data and how can it be used? Concerns about data use and misuse are 
a common concern of patients which genetic counsellors need to discuss in detail during the informed consent procedure.
Incidental findings Genetic testing often gives rise to the possibility of unexpected incidental findings.
b These could be syndromic 
features linked to the clinical diagnosis, or linked to a separate diagnosis. This can be very distressing for a 
patient and may require referrals to other specialist clinicians for screening, management or treatment.

NGS
The primary approach for the investigation of genetically heterogeneous eye disorders is through NGS. This uses massively parallel sequencing technology which enables the parallel sequencing of multiple targets from multiple samples (known as multiplexing),
62 providing a cost-effective 
method for genetic testing. One of the most fre-quently used platforms for NGS are those developed by Illumina; this is characterised by the method of DNA fragment amplification on a flow cell, known as ‘bridge amplification’.
62 In brief, 
NGS permits the sequencing of multiple short DNA fragments (averaging 150 bp in length), these fragments of DNA are then bioinformati-cally aligned to a reference genome. Variation between the aligned sequenced DNA and the ref-erence genome is identified or ‘called’, filtered for

databases such as population frequency informa-tion from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)],

before being analysed by a clinical scientist (see below).
The use of NGS is now widely used, but there are 
several different testing options available, which are defined by the capture method used to select and enrich the regions of interest in the DNA, prior to sequencing; these include (Figure 7) the following:
1. Targeted gene panels or clinical exome;
2. Whole exome sequencing (WES);3. Whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Targeted gene panels or clinical exome. Targeted 
sequencing utilises a DNA capture and enrich-
ment chemistry that specifically selects regions of interest or post sequencing ‘virtual gene panel’ targeting to focus analysis on a smaller subset of genes.
64–66 These panels are custom designed to 
target exons and flanking intronic regions of genes previously reported to be associated with genetic eye diseases. In genetic diagnosis, targeted next-generation sequencing is also called a clinical exome. For example, a targeted gene panel, named the Oculome, was designed to screen 429 known eye-related disease causing genes follow-ing clinical exome capture and sequencing.
64 
Developed by a collaboration of experts with the aim of maximising the chances of detecting path-ogenic mutations with a single genetic test and chemistry, the Oculome is divided into subsets relating to the clinical presentation, for example, if a patient has congenital cataract, then the cata-ract and lens abnormalities subpanel will be selected. A study of 277 patients who had con-genital eye disorders screened with the Oculome provided a definitive diagnosis in 68 individuals (25% diagnostic rate).
64 CNV analysis was also 
performed by analysing and comparing the read depth of exons, but the identification of break-points was not possible unless within the covered regions: any CNVs of potential clinical interest require microarray analysis for  validation.
64 A 
similar inherited eye disease panel was developed, covering exons, flanking introns and 5′- or 
Figure 7. Schematic highlighting the different coverage of NGS including targeted gene panels, whole 
exome and genome sequencing. Gene 2 is not included in the targeted gene panel. The pale purple region 
corresponds to a region difficult to sequence, not covered by NGS approaches, including whole genome 
sequencing. Each horizontal bar, called a ‘read’, is aligned to the reference genome and this alignment allows the identification of variants and copy number variations (CNVs).Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12

3′-untranslated regions with specific deep intronic 
regions of 214 associated genes; of the 192 patients tested, a disease-causing variant was found in 51% of cases.
65 Genes associated with 
IRD were reported in the Retinal Information Network database (RetNet; https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/home.htm).
The use of targeted gene panels is a cost effective 
way to maximise coverage of relevant genomic regions and genes. The benefits including (a) sequencing targeted regions with a greater read depth, meaning that lower frequency variants or mosaicism are more likely to be detected; (b) gen-erating smaller data files requiring less computa-tional and bioinformatic processing and less data storage; and (c) variants identified are targeted and thus more likely to be clinically relevant.
67 
However, the biggest limitation of targeted gene panels is the frequency of their updates: if a novel gene or variant has been associated with a partic-ular genetic eye disease, it will not be sequenced until added, but this requires the redesigning, re-ordering and re-validation of the panel before clinical use.
68 The most effective way to update 
gene panels of newly discovered genes is by using whole exome or whole genome capture with vir-tual gene panel testing (see below). The valida-tion of novel candidate genes associated with inherited eye diseases relies upon the identifica-tion of disease-causing variants in candidate genes in multiple unrelated affected individuals. Candidate genes can be added to gene panels for identification of additional cases, which can help to diagnose rare conditions. However, this approach is less commonly used to identify novel gene defects compared with whole exome or genome sequencing.
Useful online resources that will assist in under-
standing the mode of inheritance, selection of dis-ease genes and the appropriate management include Genetics Home Reference (https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/); Clinical Genome Resource (https://clinicalgenome.org/); and Gene Vision (www.gene.vision).
WES. WES is defined by the selection, enrich-
ment and sequencing of exons and flanking 
intronic regions of known protein coding genes within the human genome, and permits the use of a single capture kit. Although the exome makes up a very small proportion of the genome (~1.5%), it is estimated that over 85% of disease causing variants are within protein coding regions.
69,70 
Interestingly, all exons are covered which allow the identification of novel gene defect(s) associ-ated with the disease.
71–75 The exon coverage data 
can be used to analyse CNV, by interrogation of read depth, and may help to identify a duplication or deletion in a gene previously reported to be associated with genetic eye diseases.
49 This has 
limitations in that the average read depth gener-ated by standard WES protocols may not be suf-ficient to characterise many loss or gains. In addition, inversions, translocations, complex and noncoding rearrangements are intractable and breakpoints are usually not covered making vali-dation more  difficult. Despite only accounting for 
around 1.5% of the genome, the data generated are large. Access to a high-performance comput-ing (HPC) cluster and significant data storage can alleviate bioinformatic challenges and bottle-necks in the processing, analysis, storage and interpretation of the data.
WGS. WGS far exceeds the targeted coverage 
offered by the enrichment methods described 
above. WGS methods omit polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of targeted and exome capture, thereby enabling coverage of PCR-intractable genomic regions including GC rich exons.
74,76–79  The complete coverage of the 
genome, over 3 billion nucleotides and 20,000 genes, afforded by WGS allows the identifica-tion of previously noncovered variants such as CNVs, structural variations, intergenic and deep intronic variants.
80–85 Recently, the 100,000 
Genome Project was undertaken by Genomics England supported by NHS funding and infra-structure in England.
86–88 The objective of this 
project was to kick-start genomic medicine in the United Kingdom by generating genome data from 100,000 individuals across rare disease  
and cancer to improve clinical diagnostics for patients.
89 Of note, the cost of WGS and its 
analyses and interpretation is far higher than for an exome.
90 But as with WES or targeted gene 
panel testing, exons and flanking intronic regions of genes can be screened first to identify any dis-ease-causing variants in these regions
80 and thus, 
these methods are currently favoured by clinical genetics service laboratories and researchers as the first-line approach, reserving the rest of the genome for only cases unsolved by targeted screening.C Méjécase, S Malka et al.

Variant interpretation and reporting
Analysis of NGS data. Following NGS, the raw 
sequencing data are processed through bioinfor-matic pipelines in order to generate a human readable dataset of variants. There are numerous quality checks and controls in place to inform the scientist on the quality of the sequencing, align-ment and variant calling. The coverage indicates how well and what portion of a gene has been sequenced at a specified read depth. For example, if the coverage of a gene is reported to be 95% at 20×, this means that 95% of the gene has more than 20 sequencing reads mapping to it. This control ensures that all regions of interest are sequenced to an adequate depth.
Bioinformatic pipelines. In brief, the bioinfor-
matic pipelines have several steps characterised 
by the following:
1. Alignment: The mapping of the short sequencing reads to a reference genome achieved via tools such as BWA-mem 
(http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). This pro-duces a file known as a binary alignment file (BAM) which can be viewed using tools such as integrative genomics viewer (IGV; https://igv.org/), which is useful when assessing variants.
2. Variant calling: The process of identifying variation between the sequenced DNA and the reference DNA, via tools such as Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). This produces a variant call file (VCF), which is a text file list-ing all variants identified, their genomic posi-tion, the nucleotide change observed, and additional information relating to the quality/confidence of the variant call.
3. Variant annotation: The process of collat-ing and annotating each variant in the VCF with evidence from multisources required to aid interpretation
63,91–98  (Table 3).
4. Optional: Virtual panels and variant filter-ing to aid variant interpretation and reduce the number of variants requiring time inten-sive variant interpretation. Unlike targeted panels which specifically screen targeted regions, virtual panels are a bioinformatic filter applied post sequencing and variant calling, to filter and select variants within a defined list of genes or regions of interest. Virtual panels correspond to a list of regions,  frequently supplied in the form of a BED 
file (a tab delimited file detailing the chromo-some, start and stop position in a standard-ised format) which aids analysis by restricting variants to the region of interest and reduce the risk of incidental findings. Virtual panels are often applied to large targeted panels, whole exome or genome sequenc-ing,
64,71,72,80,99  and as this is a bioinformatics 
approach, the panel can be easily edited to include or exclude genomic locations, recently published genes,
71,72 candidate 
genes, without the need to re-run sequenc-ing. Thus, variant lists can be filtered to remove common polymorphisms and focus on rare variants and those affecting highly conserved residues/domains among spe-cies.
100 A lot of effort has been spent on 
designing and curating the virtual panels for clinical genetic analysis and has resulted in collaborative projects such as the Genomics England Panel app project (https://pane-lapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/), which aims to curate lists of clinical relevant genes asso-ciated with different phenotypes, lists vetted and tiered by experts within the scientific and clinical community.
59
Variant interpretation. Following bioinformatic 
processing, each variant identified is analysed to establish its possible association with the disease phenotype. Clear and concise phenotype informa-tion must be supplied with any genetics referral. All variants are analysed by a clinical scientist and independently checked by a second clinical scien-tist, using the information supplied through the annotation step of the bioinformatic pipeline (see above) and additional investigation of databases and publications. In general, data can be filtered following the mode of inheritance, the type of var-iants, the frequency in large-scale exome and genome sequencing datasets, the pathogenicity prediction, amino acid or nucleotide conservation across species, relevant tissue expression, protein localisation and prior related publications and mutation databases. The allele frequency filter should be applied considering the rarity of disease, inheritance of the gene/ mutation, and thus domi-
nant disease analysis may differ from recessive dis-ease/gene filtering strategies. The variant rarity is the most important feature to help to identify the disease-causing variant. For example, if the fre -
quency of an autosomal dominant disease is one in Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12
16 journals.sagepub.com/home/oed
10,000, then the frequency of variant must be less 
than one in 10,000. Of note, the frequency of known mild mutations or reduced penetrant vari-ants might be higher, as the ABCA4 variant, c.5882G> A p.(Gly1961Glu) is highly frequent in 
Somalians (~10%).
19 A virtual panel can also be applied to focus the analyses on genes previously reported to be associated with the disease, recently published genes and candidate genes, which reduces the number of putative disease-causing variants. The number of variants is highly depend-ent on the applied methods and varies between Table 3. Variant annotation uses multiple sources.

thousands to millions, which highlights the impor-
tance of variant filtering to reduce the data to a manageable size.
Variant pathogenicity interpretation has been 
standardised and classified using the five-class system (Class 5 Pathogenic; 4 Likely pathogenic; 3 Variant of unknown clinical significance; 2 Likely benign; and 1 Benign) for small nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions (indels)
109 
and this classification was also adapted for CNVs in single genes.
110,111
When no disease-causing variants are identified in known genes associated with inherited eye dis-orders, cases must be re-analysed for novel genes. High impact variants outside the panel can be uploaded to various data sharing platforms including GeneMatcher
112 with the aim of identi-
fying supporting data for causality of novel gene variants in similarly affected individuals for a large collaborative network of researchers. Moreover, syndromic genes or related gene pan-els may be considered, for example, if a patient has microphthalmia and anterior segment dys-genesis (ASD), if the MAC panel has no primary findings, the patient could also be screened with the ASD panel.
113
Cytogenetic testingCytogenetic testing can be used to verify NGS findings or to detect chromosomal abnormalities or CNVs.
114 Cytogenetic testing can include karyo-
typing, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH), fluorescent in situ  
hybridisation (FISH, used to detect and localise the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on a chromosome, for example, in ocular lym-phoma or melanoma
115,116 ) and qualitative fluo-
rescent polymerase chain reactions (QF-PCR, used to amplify specific regions of DNA to quan-tify and confirm the copy number in that specific region, previously reported with NGS approaches, and can identify common aneuploidies).
117
Array-CGH is a more detailed and sensitive tech-nique that looks for CNVs.
114,118  Array-CGH can 
detect abnormalities between 100,000 base pairs (100 kb) to more than 5,000,000 bp (5 Mb) by comparing with a normal reference genome.
114 
Studies have shown that array-CGH has shown to have higher detection rates for patients with syndromic-related ocular diseases and is often the initial genetic test performed in such individuals. Array-CGH is commonly used in children pre-senting with aniridia to detect a deletion involving the WT1 and PAX6 genes, if negative then Wilms 
tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome can be ruled out. Then single gene PCR-based sequenc-ing of PAX6 is undertaken to identify pathogenic variants causing isolated aniridia.
34,119 Array-
CGH has been found to be better at detecting CNVs in comparison with FISH and QF-PCR.
120,121  
It may also identify incidental findings for unre-lated genetic conditions; however, it is not able to detect balanced rearrangements or mosaicism.
Karyotyping is one of the most conventional ways 
of testing for chromosomal abnormalities.
122,123  It 
can only detect large anomalies (minimum size: 5–10 Mb) like deletions, inversions or duplica-tions.
124,125  It is commonly used in prenatal test-
ing for the detection of Down’s syndrome which is related to many ocular conditions including stra-bismus, refractive error, nystagmus, eyelid malpo-sition, corneal ectasias, iris nodules (Brushfield spots), presenile cataracts, glaucoma and retino-vascular anomalies.
126–128
Epigenetic testingThis is not yet considered an accredited clinical test in the United Kingdom for ophthalmic Mendelian disease, but can be conducted in research studies. Several approaches, such as methylation sensitive micro-arrays or bisulfite sequencing, exist to study the methylation profile in specific regions or across the whole genome.
129 
Methylation is an important epigenomic bio-marker that exerts a reversible chemical modifica-tion, most commonly at cytosine residue in CpG dinucleotide sequences in DNA. Methylation sensitive microarrays use methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to identify methylated frag-ments.
129 This approach needs a large quantity of 
DNA (1–10 µg) to provide methylation profile at the whole genome level and to cover several hun-dred CpG islands. Bisulfite sequencing converts methylated cytosine into uracil in CpG sites.
129 
Specific fluorescent-labelled primers are designed to hybridise the unmethylated or methylated allele and the methylation profile is visualised by microarray hybridisation or by whole genome amplification.Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12

Confirmation of variants
Class 4 or 5 variants identified by NGS may be confirmed by Sanger sequencing, although more frequently this step is being omitted when scien-tists are confident in the quality reports from the NGS pipeline. Sanger sequencing is a targeted sequencing method able to sequence approxi-mately 500 bases at a time, after an amplification step by PCR of the region of interest. This approach is needed to confirm the variant and to perform segregation studies when DNA from affected and unaffected family members is avail-able. Any potential CNVs of clinical interest detected via NGS should be confirmed by a clini-
cally validated method, such as multiplex liga-tion-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect copy loss or gain of single exons of a gene, array-CGH (microarrays) or QF-PCR, and reported as an outcome of those tests.
What does a genetic report look like and how is 
it interpreted?Clinical genetic reports are formal documents communicating analytical results of a sample to the referring clinician and must conform to the Association for Clinical Genomic Science (ACGS) guidelines for best practice.
130 All clinical reports 
must be approved and authorised by a senior clini-cal scientist, prior to being sent to the referring cli-nician. Clinical reports clearly and concisely display the overall result, with further evidence used to reach the conclusion detailed below (Figure 8). It should be noted that only confirmed variants associated with the patient’s phenotype would be reported within the main body of the report (Box 2). Analysed variants classified as class 3 ‘Variants of uncertain clinical significance’ will frequently be listed in the appendix of the report.
To ensure that reports communicate laboratory 
results effectively and meet the user’s needs and best practice guidelines, it is advised that the body of the report include the following:
 •Indication for the test/referral reason;
 •Interpretation of result and appropriate clinical advice, where possible reports should integrate genetic data with the clini-cal information that has been provided by the referring clinician;
 •Any references cited should be cited in full;
 •Information relating to the test undertaken including the test sensitivity, possible limi-tations and gene panels applied; •If there were any issues with a sample or sample details.
Clinical reports must also clearly document and identify the laboratory, patient (name, date of birth, NHS number, hospital number and sample number), referring clinician and individual writ-ing the report and the authoriser.
Genetic counselling (part 2) – post-genetic 
test inputOnce the genetic results have been received, the referring clinician should feed these back to the patient in an appropriate manner. They can offer access to potential therapies if available or refer to the correct multidisciplinary team if there are syn-dromic features to consider. For example, in patients with congenital cataracts, if a metabolic disease is detected such as cerebrotendinous xan-thomatosis caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene resulting in accumulation of cholestanol, replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid normalises plasma levels and improves the neuro-logical and non-neurological symptoms. Patients with biallelic RPE65 variants causing autosomal recessive RPE65-retinopathy are now eligible for 
the first approved retinal gene therapy called Luxturna or voretigene neparvovec.
131 This treat-
ment uses a modified adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, containing human wildtype RPE65 cDNA under the control of a ubiquitous pro-moter, which is introduced to the subretinal space through vitrectomy and subretinal injection.
132 
The wildtype/healthy RPE65 is expressed in RPE 
cells and leads to improved performance on the multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT) and full-field light sensitivity threshold (FST) up to 4 years, with ongoing monitoring. Where an approved treatment does not exist, there are numerous clinical trials in progress for ocular genetic-based therapies that can be shared with patients.
131 A useful website to keep abreast of 
clinical trials relating to a specific gene or condi-tion is ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov). Not all the trials listed are ethically approved and caution must be taken when recommending a study but it can guide advice to patients.
Some genetic results relating to the eye disorder 
may change a diagnosis or can reveal a risk of other syndromic problems which may not have been evident previously. For example, some cili-opathy gene defects, such as IQCB1, can manifest with an IRD, but heralds a significant risk of C Méjécase, S Malka et al.

Box 2. Guide to interpreting variant nomenclature.
The identified variants must be reported using standardised nomenclature set out by the human genome variation society (HGVS, http://
varnomen.hgvs.org/).133 Here is an example of how to interpret a variant, for example, ABCA4 NM_000350.2 c.5882G>A, p.(Gly1961Glu), the 
mutation reported in Figure 8:
1.  The gene name is written in italics and capital letters (ABCA4)
2.  This is associated with a transcript reference sequence, starting with a NM number (NM_000350.2) which helps to relocate the variant if 
required.
3.  The nucleotide change is a indicated by the prefix ‘c’. for complementary DNA (cDNA) reference sequence, this is followed by the position of the variant counted from the first nucleotide A of the ATG start site (c.5882)
4. At this position c.5882 the nucleotide change is written, in this case a G is changed to an A (G >A).
5.  Next the effect on the protein is given denoted as ‘p’. for protein reference sequence. The original amino acid is given first and its position (counted from the start codon AUG or methionine, Met) followed by the result due to the nucleotide change. For example, p.(Gly1961Glu) denotes that in the protein sequence at amino acid position 1961 a glycine (Gly) was changed to a glutamic acid (Glu); this is a missense mutation.
Further common examples, as nonsense, in splice site, deletion, duplication, insertion and deletion/insertion, are detailed in the table below.

kidney disease. These patients should be referred 
to a relevant specialist for management, screening and metabolic tests.
134 A genetic result can con-
firm a severe diagnosis and reduced life expec-tancy, for example, Battens disease (CLN3) or Wolfram syndrome (WFS1). These cases will require complex management, including ongoing counselling support and referral to the relevant specialist teams.
Genetic counsellors will help patients to interpret 
and act upon these results, including segregation analysis, family planning options, incidental find-ings, cope with the emotional and psychological impact. In the event of a ‘positive’ autosomal recessive result where a pathogenic or likely path-ogenic cause of a patient’s condition has been identified, segregation analysis may be necessary. Segregation analysis evaluates the transmission of genetic changes within a family. Autosomal reces-sive results will be either a homozygous patho-genic change or compound heterozygous pathogenic changes. For compound heterozygous results to be meaningful, the two changes need to be on different alleles (in trans), but it can be pos-sible that the two mutations are on the same allele (in cis). A DNA sample from a relative – usually a 
parent or child – can be tested for the two muta-tions and if the relative only carries one, rather than both or neither, it can be confirmed that the variants are in trans.
Segregation analysis can also be useful in the 
interpretation of autosomal dominant results, when a variant of uncertain significance has been found. Results from both affected and unaffected relatives can increase a variant’s likelihood of pathogenicity. The more relatives whose DNA can be tested, the stronger the evidence becomes. Also, for affected relatives, it is more meaningful, the more distant the relationship is from the proband. For segregation of autosomal dominant results, relatives DNA should be tested only for the presence or absence of the suspected variant.
In the case of unsolved or negative (no primary 
findings) results, a genetic counsellor should dis-cuss these with the patient and explain in clear terms what the reason for the negative result might be. This conversation with the patient could include limitations of technology used; the testing applied; and the current knowledge of causative genes. It should be made clear that the results do not exclude a genetic cause for the patient’s condition. Other available testing should be offered to the patient, if relevant, for example, if they have had a targeted gene panel, WGS may be the next suitable step. If a patient is receiving an unsolved result from whole genome or exome sequencing, it should also be explained that a genetic diagnosis may become available at a later date without further testing, as a result of subse-quent genetic discoveries.
Family planning and reproductive options
Genetic counsellors will be able to help patients with family planning. A pathogenic or likely patho-genic result will enable a genetic counsellor to pro-vide a patient with accurate risks to family members. When it is relevant, the genetic counsellor will also be able to discuss what reproductive options are available to patients or the parents of a patient, and refer them to a specialist clinical genetics unit when necessary. These family planning discussions will vary for each case and will be dependent upon the specific diagnosis, inheritance pattern, religious and cultural beliefs of the family. Options that may be available to patients are as follows:
 •Conceiving naturally – Depending upon the severity of the condition, the percentage risk to the child and attitudes towards the diagnosis, parents may decide to conceive a child naturally. Other options may be costly, time-consuming, conflict with a patient’s religious or cultural beliefs or may not be available depending upon their diag-nosis and existing family situation. For example in the United Kingdom, preim-plantation diagnosis is only available to patients who meet a certain age (<40 years) and who do not currently have an unaf-fected child (see below).
 •Gamete or embryo donation – Some patients or parents of patients decide to receive an egg, sperm or embryo donation which can decrease the risk of passing a condition to their child to a general population risk.
 •Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) – If a patient or the parents of a patient meets certain criteria, PGD is a form of in vitro fer-tilisation where both parents donate sperm and eggs which are fertilised in the labora-tory to produce several embryos. These embryos are then tested to see whether they are free from the condition and then the healthy embryo(s) can be implanted into the mother. PGD authorisation differs through different countries. While PGD is regulated Therapeutic Advances in Ophthalmology 12
22 journals.sagepub.com/home/oed
by the doctors’ discretion in the United 
States, PGD law varies in Europe.135 In 
Italy, PGD was authorised for fertile couples who carried inherited diseases from 2015
136 
and in Switzerland, it is legal for specific dis-eases.
135 In France, PGD is regulated by Loi 
relative de la bioéthique, from the Agence de la Biomédecine, in 2004, and each use of PGD is examined by a Centre Pluridisciplinaire de Diagnostic Prénatal (CPDPN).
135 In the 
United Kingdom, there are strict guidelines for eligibility, including the following:
°  The diagnosis in question must be seri-ous and on the approved Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) list.
°  The risk to the child of inheriting the condition must be greater than 10%, which usually means that patients with autosomal recessive conditions are not eligible (unless their partner is known to be a carrier). However, parents of a child with an autosomal recessive con-dition who are likely to have a 25% risk of having another child with the condi-tion would meet this criterion.
°  The couple must not have an unaf-
fected child already.
°  Both parents must not have any known fertility problems.
°  Both parents must be non-smokers.
°  The female parent must have a healthy 
body mass index (BMI: 19–30) and must be under the age of 40 at the time of treatment.
 •Prenatal testing (and termination of preg-nancy) – After conceiving a child naturally, it can be possible to screen the foetus to see whether the child is affected with a condi-tion. For some developmental conditions (e.g. anophthalmia), a non-invasive detailed ultrasound can show the affected status of the child. For other conditions, invasive prenatal genetic tests such as chorionic vil-lus sampling or amniocentesis may be required in order to determine the affected status of the child which can carry a small risk of miscarriage. A new non-invasive pre-natal testing (NIPT) method is now availa-ble using a blood sample from a pregnant mother, this contains cell free DNA (cfDNA) from the placenta that carries the DNA of the foetus. This can be used to test for rare genetic diseases that are caused by single gene variation; the result is definitive and does not need to be confirmed by inva-sive tests. This is referred to as non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD).
137 Parents can 
use information gained from prenatal test-ing to decide whether or not to continue a pregnancy.

ConclusionGenetic testing has significantly advanced over the past decade, moving from predominantly the research field to a well-scrutinised and monitored accredited clinical service for patients. There are increasing numbers of known disease-causing genes and variants that can be screened in parallel and at low cost. Diagnostic rates are increasing especially with NGS technologies such as WGS. With existing therapies such as voretigene nepar-vovec, and many emerging clinical trials investi-gating the use of gene or mutation-specific approaches such as gene replacement using viral vector delivery, small molecule drugs for non-sense mutation suppression and antisense oligo-nucleotides for splice modulation,
131,138–140  a 
molecular diagnosis is essential for patient eligi-bility. A positive molecular diagnosis also aids in gathering natural history data on the course of disease experienced by gene-specific cohorts in order to help with prognosis and establish out-come measures for response to treatments. For the patient and family themselves, knowing the cause of their condition can provide much com-fort, and it will support their family planning decisions.
