Abstract
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of diseases whose
common landmark is progressive photoreceptor loss. The develop-ment of gene-specific therapies for IRDs is hampered by their widegenetic heterogeneity. Mitochondrial dysfunction is proving toconstitute one of the key pathogenic events in IRDs; hence,approaches that enhance mitochondrial activities have a promis-ing therapeutic potential for these conditions. We previouslyreported that miR- 181a/b downregulation boosts mitochondrial
turnover in models of primary retinal mitochondrial diseases. Here,we show that miR- 181a/b silencing has a beneficial effect also in
IRDs. In particular, the injection in the subretinal space of anadeno-associated viral vector (AAV) that harbors a miR- 181a/b
inhibitor (sponge) sequence (AAV 2/8-GFP-Sponge-miR- 181a/b)
improves retinal morphology and visual function both in models ofautosomal dominant ( RHO-P 347S) and of autosomal recessive
(rd10 ) retinitis pigmentosa. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-
181a/b downregulation modulates the level of the mitochondrial
fission-related protein Drp 1and rescues the mitochondrial frag-
mentation in RHO-P 347Sphotoreceptors. Overall, these data sup-
port the potential use of miR- 181a/b downregulation as an
innovative mutation-independent therapeutic strategy for IRDs,which can be effective both to delay disease progression and toaid gene-specific therapeutic approaches.Keywords inherited retinal diseases; miR- 181; mitochondria; photoreceptor;

Introduction
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are among the most prevalent
causes of vision loss/blindness of genetic origin in the working-agepopulation. They encompass a variety of different clinical subtypessuch as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Leber congenital amaurosis(LCA), and macular diseases. IRDs display extensive genetic hetero-geneity with more than 250 causative genes identified thus far(https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/disease.htm ). Gene-replacement thera-
pies are proving to be effective in the treatment of IRDs caused byloss-of-function mutations as exemplified by the recent approvalof Voretigene Neparvovec for the treatment of conditions caused bymutations in the RPE65 gene (Ledford, 2017 ; Apte, 2018 ). Unfortu-
nately, gene replacement cannot be effectively applied to IRDscaused by gain-of-function mutations, in which the silencing ofthe mutated allele is primarily required. Moreover, the highgenetic heterogeneity of IRDs significantly limit the set up of

fraction of patients (Carrella et al,2020 ).
Gene/mutation-independent therapeutic strategies that aim at
decreasing and/or delaying cell death in the affected retina, inde-pendently of the primary genetic defect, constitute a valid and/orcomplementary alternative to gene-based approaches (Carrella et al,
2020 ). Degeneration of photoreceptors (PRs) is the common land-
mark in IRDs even though a precise knowledge of the underlyingmolecular and cellular events is still far from reach. Among the mostrelevant pathways involved, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroin-flammation, and microglia activation are known to worsen PR deathand accelerate disease progression (Ambati et al,2013 ; Cuenca
et al,2014 ; Zhao et al,2015 ; Lefevere et al,2017 ; Mirra & Marfany,
2019 ; Carrella et al,2021 ). Targeting key effectors that impact on
common dysregulated pathways in neuronal damage during diseaseprogression hold great promise for therapeutic purposes (Indrieriet al,2019 ; Carrella et al,2020 ). In the latter respect, microRNAs
(miRNAs), given their ability to simultaneously modulate multiplemolecular pathways commonly associated with disease pathogene-sis and progression, constitute appealing targets toward the designof gene/mutation-independent therapeutic strategies (Askou et al,
2018 ).
We recently identified miR-181a and miR-181b (miR-181a/b) as
possible therapeutic targets for mitochondrial-related retinal dis-eases (Indrieri et al,2019 ). MiR-181a/b are highly expressed in
the central nervous system (CNS) and in different retinal cell types(Busskamp et al,2014 ; Indrieri et al,2019 ). They are part of the
miR-181 miRNA family and are localized in two distinct genomicclusters in mammals ( miR-181a/b-1 and miR-181a/b-2 ). The
mature forms of miR-181a and miR-181b produced by both clus-ters show identical sequences. Furthermore, the “seed” sequence,that is, the domain hypothesized to play the most relevant role intarget recognition, is identical between miR-181a and miR-181b(Indrieri et al,2020 ). Several mitochondrial-related transcripts are
direct targets of miR-181a/b, for example, Bcl2,Mcl1 , and Park2
(Ouyang et al,2012 ; Cheng et al,2016 ). We recently demon-
strated that miR-181a/b control mitochondrial turnover and func-tion in vivo by targeting genes involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis, function, and clearance, as well as in reactive oxigenspecies (ROS) detoxification (i.e., Tfam ,Nrf1,Cox11 ,CoQ10B , and
Prdx3 ) (Indrieri etal,2019 ;
 Barbato et al,2021 ). Genetic inactiva-
tion of miR-181a/b-1 leads to increased levels of mitochondrial
biogenesis and mitophagy in the retina of mouse models of pri-mary mitochondrial dysfunction leading to strong protection fromneuronal cell death and to significant amelioration of the diseasephenotype (Indrieri et al,2019 ). In particular, we showed that
genetic inactivation of miR-181a/b-1 protects retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) and ameliorates visual function in different mouse modelsof Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) strongly indicatingthat these miRNAs may represent effective therapeutic targets forthis disease (Indrieri et al,2019 ). Notably, we also demonstrated
that miR-181a/ b-1ablation did not cause per se neither abnormali-
ties in retinal morphology nor alteration of retinal function, thussupporting the safety of miR-181a/b downregulation in the retina(Indrieri et al,2019 ).
Over the last decades, evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion to IRDs is increasing (Carrella et al,2021 ). The outer retina is
known to have a high metabolic demand, which is associated withabundance of mitochondria in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)and PRs. The latter cells are under constant environmental chal-lenges and are highly prone to oxidative stress, a major contributorto retinal degenerations and hence IRDs (Lefevere et al,2017 ; Mirra
& Marfany, 2019 ; Jiang et al,2022 ). Importantly, since mitochon-
drial dysfunction seems to be an early event in IRDs, approachestargeting basic mitochondrial functions hold great therapeuticpromise (Lefevere et al,2017 ; Carrella et al,2021 ).
Here, we tested the possible neuroprotective effect of miR-181a/
b downregulation in IRDs. We demonstrated that miR-181a/b down-regulation protects PRs from death and ameliorates their morphol-ogy, resulting in improvement of visual function in two differentIRD models. We also observed amelioration of mitochondria mor-phology in PRs, along with a concomitant downregulation of themitochondrial fission protein Drp1 mediated by the activation of theJAK2/STAT3 pathway. Our data unveil a novel molecular mecha-nism by which miR-181a/b regulate mitochondrial morphology andfunction in diseased conditions and identified an AAV-mediatedsponge strategy to efficiently downregulate miR-181a/b in vivo .W e
demonstrated that miR-181a/b downregulation could be effective inameliorating retinal function across different IRD models with amutation/gene-independent mechanism, thus providing a novelpotential therapeutic strategy that deserves further developmenttoward clinical application in patients.

miR- 181a/b-1 downregulation slows down retinal degeneration
in P347S mice
The transgenic line carrying the proline-347 to serine (P347S) muta-tion in the Rhodopsin (RHO) protein is a model for autosomal domi-nant (AD) RP. These animals show a reduction in electroretinogram(ERG) amplitudes that correlate with the extent of PR loss (Li et al,
1996 ). The P347S mutation leads to mis-trafficking of the RHO pro-
tein with defective vectorial transport of post-Golgi vesicles, whichmostly fail in reaching the nascent disks of the PR outer segment(OS) (Li et al,1996 ; Greenwald et al,2013 ) and is therefore mis-
localized to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the transgenic mouseretina (Chadderton et al,2009 ; Marrocco et al,2021 ; Patrizi et al,
2021 ). A reduced ERG response in RHO- P347S mice (from now
onward termed P347S) can be observed at postnatal day (p) 30 and,albeit severely impaired, can be recorded up to p70 –90. To study
the effect of miR-181a/b inactivation on RP progression, we crossedmiR-181a /b-1
+//C0(Henao-Mejia et al,2013 ; Indrieri et al,2019 ) with
P347S+/+mice to obtain, in the same litters, P347S+//C0/miR-181a/
b-1+/+and P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals, termed P347S and
P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0, respectively (see Materials and Methods).
Most of the analyzed miR-181a/b targets (i.e., Cox11 ,Erk2, Mcl1 ,
Bcl2,Nrf1,Coq10b ,Atg5 ,Xiap ,Pgc1a ,Park2 , and Prdx3 ) displayed
increased transcript levels in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0versus P347S
eyes, as measured by quantitative (q)RT –PCR (Fig 1A).
Cell death was analyzed in the retinas of P347S and P347S/miR-
181a/b-1+//C0animals by active caspase-3 staining and TUNEL assays
at p30. A significant decrease of cell death in the ONL of P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0with respect to P347S was observed (Fig 1B–G). At
the same time point, we also detected a significant improvement of

(Fig 2A–C ).
Although we did not observe significant differences in ONL thick-
ness at p30 (Fig EV1A –D), the expression of the PR markersRhodopsin (Fig 2D–F0), C-Arrestin (Fig 2G–I0), and Recoverin
(Fig EV1E –H) was better preserved in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0eyes
as compared with P347S controls. In particular, we noticed amelio-ration of: (i) Rhodopsin distribution, which displayed a lower extentof retainment in the ONL (Fig 2D–F
0and P); (ii) structure of cone

surement of OS length on electron microscopy (EM) images
(Fig EV1I –K); and (iii) inner segment (IS) structures, as highlighted
by Phalloidin staining (Fig 2M–P).
Notably, the beneficial effect of miR-181a/b downregulation
was still detectable at later time points (p90), when we observedstatistically significant preservation of b-wave ERG response(Fig 3A–C ), with amelioration of PR markers expression (Fig 3D–
L) and a slight increase in ONL thickness (Fig 3M). We observed
a statistically significant increase in photopic a-waves ampli-tudes suggesting that the PRs with preserved functionality aremostly cones at this late time point. We also decided to test thespatial frequency threshold of vision (i.e., visual acuity expressedin cycles/degree), determined by measuring the optokineticresponse (OKR). P347S animals displayed a dramatic impair-ment of OKR response, in agreement with previous reports (Yuet al,2017 ). Conversely, P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0animals showed
a significant amelioration of OKR response at the same stage(Fig 3N).
Taken together, these results indicate that miR-181a/b downreg-
ulation improves retinal function and slows down retina degenera-tion in P347S mice.

defects in P 347S mice
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to exacerbate PR death
and disease progression in mendelian and multifactorial forms ofouter retinal degeneration (Lefevere et al,2017 ; Carrella et al,
2021 ). However, mitochondria defects have not been reported in the
P347S model to date. Our previously generated RNA-seq transcrip-tome data (Karali et al,2020 ) revealed a significant downregulation
of mitochondria-related gene pathways at p12 in the P347S retina

mitochondrial dysfunction even before the appearance of PR degen-eration (Fig 4A, Table EV1). We therefore investigated in further
details the putative mitochondrial defects in the P347S retina. EManalysis highlighted a fragmented mitochondrial morphology at p12and p30 in PRs (Fig 4B, C and E ; see Materials and Methods section
and Appendix Figs S1andS2for further details). The extent of frag-
mentation was quantified by measuring the mitochondrial perime-ter, which is significantly decreased in P347S animals comparedwith WT mice at both time points (Fig 4G). Although we did not
observe any significant variation in the total number of mitochon-dria (Fig 4H), we found a strong reduction in mitochondrial area in
P347S versus WT PRs at p30, suggesting a decrease in mitochon-drial mass during retinal degeneration progression (Fig 4I). This
observation was further confirmed by the decrease in mitochondrialproteins in P347S retinas as assessed by immunofluorescence ofcitrate synthase (CS) at p12 and p30 (Fig EV2A –B
0, D and D0, red tri-
angles) and by Western blot (WB) for the mitochondrial proteinsAtp5A, Uqcrc2, Mtco1, Sdhb, NdufB8, and CS (Fig EV2F and G ).
Interestingly, the reduction of miR-181a/b levels in P347S/miR-
181a/b-1
+//C0mice led to an amelioration of CS staining (Fig EV2C,
C0, E and E0), an increase in mitochondrial proteins (Fig EV2F and
G) and an amelioration of the mitochondrial fragmentation pheno-
type at p30 (Fig 4D, F and G ). Accordingly, WB analysis also
revealed significantly increased levels of Drp1 (Fig 5A and B ) and a
trend of increased levels of Fis1 (Fig EV2H and I ), two key regula-
tors of mitochondrial fission, in P347S retinas, while no significantvariation was observed for Opa1 and Mfn1/2, which are key regula-tors of mitochondrial fusion (Fig EV2H and I ). We therefore hypoth-
esized that the increase of Drp1 and Fis1 could underlies themitochondrial fragmentation in P347S PRs. Interestingly, in P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0retinas, we observed that the Drp1 protein levels
were decreased with respect to the P347S retina (Fig 5A and B ).
Notably, downregulation of the Drp1 protein correlates with adecrease in Drp1 transcript levels in the eyes of P347S/miR-181a/
b-1
+//C0with respect to those found in P347S animals (Fig 5C). These
data suggest that the partial rescue of Drp1 protein amounts likelyoccurs at the transcript level. It was recently reported that Drp1
transcription can be negatively modulated by IRF1 (Huang et al,
2020 ), a downstream effector of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Guschin
et al,1995 ; Kojima et al,1996 ; Yamanaka et al,1996 ; Sato et al,
1997 ; Garcia-Diaz et al,2017 ). We thus hypothesized that the
decrease in Drp1 transcript and protein levels could be mediated by
miR-181a/b targeting of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Signal transduc-ers and activators of transcription (STATs) constitute a family oftranscription factors that mediate a wide variety of biological func-tions in the nervous systems. STAT activation is mediated by JAKfamily members and is induced in response to multiple cytokinesand growth factors that are released after injury in neuronal tissues.STAT family members can play different roles. In particular, STAT3is emerging as a key effector of neuronal survival by inducing theexpression of neuroprotective genes (Dziennis & Alkayed, 2008 ).
STAT3 augmentation was previously shown to significantly enhancePR survival and improve retinal electrophysiology in P347S mice(Jiang et al,2014 ). Both Jak2 and Stat3 have been reported to be
direct targets of miR-181a/b (Qu et al,2017 ; Lai et al,2020 ). We
observed, by qRT –PCR, that Jak2 and Stat3 transcripts are upregu-
lated in P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0with respect to P347S eyes(Fig 5D). This upregulation is accompanied by an increase in both
STAT3 and of Phospho(p)-705-STAT3 protein levels (Fig EV3A and
B). Immunofluorescence analysis of the STAT3 protein revealed that
the increase in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0occurs in all retinal layers,
including the ONL (Fig EV3C –G). The phosphorylation at position
705 is mainly mediated by JAK2 and leads to the translocation ofSTAT3 to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of severalpro-survival genes (Dziennis & Alkayed, 2008 ; Jiang et al,2014 ).
Consistently, we detected, by qRT –PCR, increased transcript levels
of several p-705-STAT3 downstream targets, among which Irf1(Lee
et al,2006 ; Walch-R €uckheim et al,2016 ) (Fig EV3H ), while we did
not observe any statistically significant variation of p-727-STAT3(Fig EV3A and B ), a modification that mediates STAT3 translocation
to mitochondria (Wegrzyn et al,2009 ; Zhang et al,2013 ). To verify
whether the upregulation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway mediates, viaIrf1, Drp1 downregulation in P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0eyes, we
treated P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0eyes with a JAK2 inhibitor (FEDRA-
TINIB) in ex-vivo conditions. Eight hours of treatment led to a
decrease of p-705-STAT3 as determined by WB (Fig EV3I and J ).
We observed that the FEDRATINIB treatment dramatically reducesIrf1 transcript levels (Fig 5E) and increases Drp1 transcript and
Drp1protein levels (Fig 5A, E and F ) in P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0as
compared with DMSO only treated eyes. These data confirm thatdownregulation of miR-181a/b rescues Drp1 levels by enhancingthe JAK2/STAT3/IRF1 pathway.
AAV2/8-Sponge-miR- 181a/b delivery downregulates miR- 181a/b
activity and ameliorates the retinal phenotype of P347 S mice
Based on the evidence that the heterozygous genetic inactivation of
the miR-181a/b-1 locus exerts a beneficial effect in the P347S model(Figs 1–4), we decided to further explore the therapeutic potential
of miR-181a/b silencing by using an AAV-mediated delivery to theretina of a miRNA sponge. MiRNA sponges are RNA molecules withtandemly repeated miRNA antisense sequences (miRNA bindingsites, MBS) that can sequester miRNAs from their endogenous tar-gets resulting in their long-term silencing in vivo (Ebert & Sharp,
2010 ). We previously generated miR-181a/b sponges and tested
their efficacy in vitro (Barbato et al,2021 ). To achieve long-term
loss-of-function of miR-181a/b in vivo , we produced AAV2/8 vec-
tors expressing the miR-181a/b sponge construct (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b) and a control (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP).To demonstrate efficacy of the miR-181a/b Sponge in the retina, weinjected the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b vector in thesubretinal space of WT mice at p20. As controls, the contralateraleyes were injected with the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP vector. The AAV2/8serotype efficiently transduces RPE, PRs, and M €uller glia cells upon
subretinal administration in several species, including mice (Alloccaet al,2007 ). Accordingly, we observed a good transduction of RPE,
PRs, and M €uller glia cells 3 weeks after subretinal administration of
both AAV2/8.CMV.GFP and AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b(Appendix Fig S3A–F). Subretinal injection at p4 of AAV2/
8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b in WT retina does not alter ERGresponses at p30 with respect to AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected retinas(Appendix Fig S3G and H). Moreover, we observed, by qRT –PCR,
significantly increased levels of miR-181a/b mRNA targets in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b versus AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injectedretinas (Appendix Fig S3I).

of the human RHO promoter (Botta et al,2016 ) (AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-
Sponge-miR-181a/b). For the RPE-specific overexpression, we usedthe promoter of the human VMD2 gene (Esumi et al,2004 ) (AAV2/
8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b). Vectors driving the expressionof GFP under the control of the same promoters (AAV2/8.RHO.GFPand AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP) were used as controls and injected in thecontralateral eyes. We tested the above-described constructs inP347S animals (Appendix Fig S3J–O). The animals were subreti-
nally injected at p4, and their retinas were analyzed at p30 and p70.We observed a significant increase in b-wave ERG responses, regis-tered under scotopic conditions, at both time points in P347S eyesinjected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b and in eyesinjected with AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b, comparedwith the corresponding control-injected eyes (Fig 6A–C ). Con-
versely, we did not observe any significant effect when using theAAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b (Fig 6A–C). These results
suggest that miR-181a/b silencing restricted only to the RPE is notsufficient to exert a protective effect in P347S mice. Although notsignificant, we observed a trend of amelioration, both at p30 and atp70, in the a-waves registered in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected P347S eyes versus the corresponding controls(Fig EV4A –C). Cryosections of P347S AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-
miR-181a/b- and AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injectedretinas were analyzed at p30 and p70. We detected with both con-structs, and at both time points, improved PR marker expression,observing greater effect when using the CMV promoter (Fig 6D–G
0,
L–O0, T and U; please compare panels D and E, white arrowheads).
Moreover, we observed amelioration of C-Arrestin staining in theOS (Fig 6H–K
0,P–S0, T and U; white arrowheads) and of Recoverin
staining at p70 (Appendix Fig S4A–I). We also evaluated the extent
of photoreceptor cell death at p30, by TUNEL assays. We observed adecrease in TUNEL-positive cells per injected area (GFP-positivearea) in the ONL of AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injectedeyes versus those injected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP (Fig EV4D–H ,
black triangles). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showedan amelioration of CS staining in the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected IS with respect to the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected ones (Fig EV4I –L, red triangles), suggesting that Sponge-
miR-181a/b-treatment induces an amelioration of the mitochondrialphenotype similar to what we observed in the genetic miR-181a/bdownregulation model (Fig EV2D –E
0). To assess whether miR-181a/
b downregulation exerts a beneficial effect also when delivered atlater time points, in a fully differentiated retina, we injected P347Smice at p12/p14 using both AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/band AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b along with their corre-sponding control vectors. Such time points of intervention representmore disease-relevant stages. Following subretinal injection at p12/p14, we recorded a trend of improved ERG responses (b-waves) atp30 and p70 (Appendix Fig S5A–C and M –O), with a statistically
significant effect at p30 (Appendix Fig S5B), and amelioration of
PR markers expression in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes versus the corresponding control eyes, moreevident at p30 (Appendix Fig S5D–E
0,H–I0and L) than at p70
(Appendix Fig S5P–Q0,T–U0and X; white arrowheads). A similar
trend was also observed in AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/banimals subretinally injected at p12/p14 and analyzed at p30 andp70, albeit a statistical significance in ERG results was not obtained(Appendix Fig S5A–C and M –O), and with lower effects on PR
marker expression at both p30 and p70 (Appendix Fig S5F–G
0,J–L,
R–S0and V –X; white arrowheads).
The above data indicate that AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-
mediated miR-181a/b inhibition ameliorates the P347S retinal phe-notype also when administered after the onset of degeneration. Theobservation of a stronger effect obtained with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b versus AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/binjections, particularly following injections at later time points, indi-cates that although the effect of miR-181a/b downregulation in theP347S model has a PR cell autonomous component, it may probablyinvolve other retinal cell types.
AAV2/8-Sponge-miR- 181a/b delivery ameliorates the retinal
phenotype of rd10mice
Based on the evidence that AAV2/8-Sponge-miR-181a/b delivery
exerted a beneficial effect in the retina of P347S mice, we decided toinvestigate whether this strategy could be extended to other IRDmodels to evaluate the mutation(gene)-independent value of thisapproach. To achieve this goal, we tested the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b, which yielded the most evident effect in P347Smice, in the rd10 mouse model. The latter is a model for autosomal
recessive (AR) RP and carries a spontaneous mutation in the Pde6b
gene that recapitulates the human condition (Chang et al,2002 ).
Pde6b encodes the bsubunit of the rod-specific phosphodiesterase
(bPDE), which, when absent, results in toxic levels of intracellular
Ca

retinal degeneration phenotype, as supported by studies showingthat the use of anti-oxidants is effective in slowing down retinal celldeath (Komeima et al,2007 ,2008 ; Oveson et al,2011 ; Piano et al,
2019 ). Moreover, rd10 animals display, similar to P347S mice (Jiang
et al,2014 ), increased levels of the STAT3 protein in the degenerat-
ing retina (Ly et al,2016 ; Roche et al,2018 ).Rd10 mice show a
severely impaired ERG response and a dramatically reduced ONLthickness at p30 (Chang et al,2002 ). The animals were subretinally
injected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b in one eye andthe corresponding control vector (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP) in the con-tralateral eye, at p4 or p10. As expected, the ONL thickness of rd10
AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected retinas was significantly reduced at p30,because of progressive retinal degeneration. Conversely, the ONLthickness was higher at p30 in Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected rd10
retinas following both injection time points (Fig 7A–H
0). The p4-
injected retinas also showed enhanced expression of Rhodopsin(Fig 7A–B

(Fig EV5A –E). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis showed an
amelioration of CS staining in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes versus AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected controls(Fig EV5F –I″, red triangles). The rd10 mouse model shows a rapid
and severe degeneration (Chang et al,2002 ); therefore, ERG
responses were severely impaired (Fig EV5J –O), as expected, and
we could observe only a significant amelioration of b-waveresponses in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b p4-injected

assays that allow to detect slight differences in retinal function, such
as pupillary light responses (PLR) and water maze tests. Retinalfunction tests based on PLR showed a significantly higher pupil con-striction in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected than inAAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected rd10 eyes, at both 10 and 100 lux stimuli
(about 23 and 25% more, respectively) (Fig 7J). In addition, the
water maze test was used to analyze visual acuity as previouslyreported (Pang et al,2008 ; Batabyal et al,2021 ). This latter test
revealed an improved visual function in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected animals that showed a significant reduction inthe latency to reach the platform with respect to control-injectedones (Fig 7K). These data indicate that miR-181a/b downregulation
ameliorates retinal morphology and function across different IRDmodels.
Discussion
In this report, we show for the first time that miR-181a/b silencing,obtained both by genetic approaches and by administration to theretina of a specific miR-181 inhibitor (sponge), exerts a beneficialeffect in two very different models of IRDs, namely an autosomaldominant model, characterized by a gain-of-function mechanism(P347S) and an autosomal recessive model, caused by a loss-of-function mutation ( rd10). The AAV-mediated subretinal administra-
tion of a specific miR-181a/b silencing molecule provided us withthe proof of the translational potential of miR-181a/b downregula-tion as a mutation-independent therapeutic strategy for IRDs. Bene-ficial effects were obtained by interventions at early and later timepoints, when fully differentiated P347S and rd10 retinas already
exhibit initial signs of degeneration. We observed amelioration ofvisual function and PR marker expression following injection atboth time points, although injections at later time point yielded amilder improvement. Nevertheless, the functional recovery by injec-tions carried out after disease onset is important, as it supports theclinical potential of the approach at stages of disease progressionrelevant for the amelioration of patient’s quality of life. The useddelivery route, vehicle (i.e., AAV vectors, serotype 2/8), and diseasestage at intervention (i.e., onset of retinal degeneration) are compat-ible with the development of a clinical protocol for human transla-tional purposes (e.g., subretinal delivery in patients) (Hudry &Vandenberghe, 2019 ). We previously demonstrated that the down-
regulation of miR-181a/b, via genetic ablation of cluster-1, does notimpact on retina structure and function (Indrieri et al,2019 ), and
we now showed that the AAV subretinal delivery of the sponge,which results in effective decrease in miR-181a/b activity, does notalter ERG response providing further support to the safety of thisapproach.
The data obtained with the use of the RHO andVMD2 promoters
demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of miR-181a/b downreg-ulation in this IRD model is exerted, at least in part, through a PR-autonomous mechanism. The AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections did not produce any significant improvement ofERG responses, indicating that the miR-181a/b downregulationrestricted to the RPE is not sufficient to warrant a beneficial effect inthe retina of P347S animals. However, we cannot rule out the possi-bility that the VMD2 promoter does not yield the same level ofexpression as the CMV protomer in the RPE, and further experi-ments are needed to discriminate between the two possibilities.AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections determined anamelioration of the retinal phenotype, which, however, was less evi-dent and significant compared with that obtained after AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections. This indicates that theadministration of the Sponge-miR-181a/b under a ubiquitous pro-moter had a stronger effect, presumably through the pleiotropicaction of this miRNA on multiple cell targets that are transduced bythe 2/8 AAV serotype (e.g., rod and cone photoreceptors, M €uller
glia, and microglia). Besides neurons, the retina also contains a glialcomponent, represented by M €uller cells, astrocytes, and the micro-
glia, that orchestrate neuroinflammatory response, recovery frominjury and progression of disease. At present, we do not have anyevidence for a role of miR-181a/b in microglia modulation, but fur-ther studies are needed to gain insight into this issue.
The hypothesis of a PR-autonomous action of miR-181a/b,
although partial, is also corroborated by our EM data, whichrevealed an alteration of mitochondria morphology in P347S PRs.Although it was previously reported that the RHO- P347S mutation
causes mis-trafficking of RHO proteins (Li et al,1996 ; Greenwald
et al,2013 ), the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the retinal
degeneration, as well as the final cell death mechanisms, are notfully elucidated in this model. Here, we describe, for the first time, amitochondrial phenotype in P347S mice that can be detected asearly as p12, thus supporting its early involvement in disease patho-genesis. This model displays (i) transcriptome changes pointing tomitochondrial dysfunction and (ii) mitochondrial fragmentation.The latter results correlate with an increase in Drp1 and Fis1 proteinlevels. These two proteins are key regulators of mitochondrial fis-sion, and therefore, their upregulation may explain the mitochon-drial fragmentation phenotype. MiR-181a/b have already beendemonstrated to regulate key genes involved in mitochondrial bio-genesis and function (Indrieri et al,2019 ; Barbato et al,2021 ). Here,
we show that their downregulation rescues the mitochondrial frag-mentation phenotype of P347S PRs, with a concomitant ameliora-tion of mitochondrial proteins and a decrease in Drp1 protein levels,mediated by miR-181a/b regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.The activation of the latter pathway leads to the increase in severaltarget genes, involved in pro-survival function. Interestingly, it waspreviously demonstrated that endogenous Stat3 expression was sig-nificantly increased in mutant PRs from three unrelated IRD models[P347S, Prph2
rds/ +(Jiang et al,2014 ), and rd10 mice (Ly et al,
2016 ; Roche et al,2018 )], and significantly improves mutant PR sur-
vival and retinal electrophysiology (Jiang et al,2014 ). Although the
mechanism underlying the protective effect of Stat3 in IRDs remainsto be defined (Jiang et al,2014 ), it is tempting to speculate that the
p705-Stat3 downstream genes, which are upregulated in our modelafter miR-181a/b-1 inactivation (Fig EV3H ), may be responsible for
the Stat3-dependent effect on mutant PR survival and could have animpact on the decrease in cell death detected.
We report here that the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
has an impact on the mitochondrial dynamics related protein Drp1,whose imbalance is often associated with neuronal cell death (Kimet al,2015 ; Viringipurampeer et al,2016 ; Oliver & Reddy, 2019 ). In
cells, the equilibrium between small-fragmented mitochondria andlong interconnected mitochondrial networks is essential to ensuremitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival. This equilibrium is
12of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 |2022 /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et almaintained by the proper balance between mitochondrial fusion
and fission processes, which guarantee the ever-changing dynamicstate of mitochondria, where mitochondrial networks are constantlyelongating and dividing (Twig & Shirihai, 2011 ; Calo et al,2013 ;
Balog et al,2016 ; Anzell et al,2018 ). Increased mitochondrial fis-
sion and reduced fusion are prominent features in aging and inmany neurological diseases (Oliver & Reddy, 2019 ). The master
mediator of fission is Drp1, whose role is fundamental in maintain-ing balance in mitochondrial dynamics, primarily as a mitochondrialfission factor, but when downregulated, indirectly promotes fusion.In this respect, we observed mitochondria elongation rescue anddecreased level of Drp1 in the P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0retina, medi-
ated by the increase in the JAK2/STAT3/IRF1 pathway, thus unveil-ing a novel mechanism of JAK2/STAT3 regulation of mitochondrialdynamics.
We previously demonstrated that miR-181a/b control mitochon-
drial turnover by acting on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy inthe retina of mouse models of LHON (Indrieri et al,2019 ). We now
report that these miRNAs also act on mitochondrial fission/fusionbalance as revealed by the analysis of an autosomal dominantmouse model of RP. Altogether these findings reveal that miR-181a/b have a pervasive role in the modulation of mitochondrial activi-ties. Moreover, our results highlight that miR-181a/b downregula-tion/silencing has a protective effect in clinically and geneticallydifferent types of retinal neurodegenerative diseases, including amitochondrial disease model (Indrieri et al,2019 ), an autosomal
dominant and an autosomal recessive IRD models. These data sup-port the potential of miR-181a/b modulation as a gene/mutation-independent therapeutic approach to slow down the progression ofa vast class of retinal diseases with either primary or secondarymitochondrial involvement, which affect both the outer and theinner retina. This strategy can represent a therapeutic agent thatdampens disease-amplifying processes, thus also supporting gene-specific replacement approaches, and may also be relevant for non-mendelian, multifactorial forms of retinopathies associated withmitochondrial dysfunction, such as age-related macular degenera-tion or diabetic retinopathy, although further research efforts areneeded to address this latter perspective.
Materials and Methods
Animal studies
All studies on mice were conducted in accordance with the institu-
tional guidelines for animal research (ARRIVE guidelines) andapproved by the Italian Ministry of Health; Department of PublicHealth, Animal Health, Nutrition and Food Safety in accordance withthe law on animal experimentation (article 7; D.L. 116/92; protocolnumber: 254/2018-PR). All animal treatments were reviewed andapproved in advance by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the Tele-thon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (Pozzuoli, Italy). Mice weremaintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF)-like conditions at theTIGEM Animal Facility. Examinations are conducted periodically onthe animals stored in the establishment to confirm they are not con-taminated with pathogens of infectious diseases. Same sex litter mateswere housed together in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) withmaximum four mice per cage. All mice were maintained on a regular12/12-h light/dark cycle, temperature of 20 –24°C, and humidity of
54–65%, with ad libitum access to food and water. Feeding control
and sanitary control are carried out under the supervision of a com-mittee that include veterinarians in the establishment. All materials,including IVCs, lids, feeders, bottles, bedding, and water, were auto-claved before use. Both male and female animals were used in allexperiments. For subretinal injections in the RHO- P347S background,
pups were obtained by crossing the RHO- P347S
+/+transgenic (A1 line)
(Liet al,1996 ) with C57BL/6J mice (JAX /C226Mice Strain, Charles Rivers
Laboratories, Strain Code 632), to obtain the P347S+//C0mice (Mus-
solino et al,2011 ;B o t t a et al,2016 ,2017 ; Karali et al,2020 ). Please
note that we excluded the presence of the rd8allele in the above mice.
TheRHO- P347S+/+(A1 line) is in the 129 S2/SvHsd (Harlan, Hunting-
ton, UK) background and was obtained from the laboratory of Dr.Jane G. Farrar (Loscher et al,2007 ;C h a d d e r t o n et al,2009 ; Palfi et al,
2016 ), and was maintained by crossing A1 P347S
+/+with A1 P347S+/+.
For the analysis of miR-181a/b genetic decrease in RHO- P347S
background, we crossed RHO-P347S+/+transgenic (Li et al,1996 )
with miR-181a/b-1+//C0(Henao-Mejia et al,2013 ; Indrieri et al,2019 ),
obtaining in the same litters P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+/+, simply ter-
med P347S, and P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals, termed P347S/

P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals were obtained from the same litters
and sacrificed at the same time. Pde6brd10(rd10) mice were kindly

RNA extractions
Optic cup samples were processed in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN).
Total RNA from optic cup samples was extracted using the RNeasyextraction kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR
For quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT –PCR)
experiments, cDNAs were generated using QuantiTect Reverse Tran-
scription Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-tions.
Primers for qRT –PCR reactions were designed to span two differ-
ent exons to avoid genomic DNA amplification using in silico tools
(www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html ) to predict
their melting temperature ( T
m) and to avoid the possibility of self-
annealing or primer dimerization. The specificity of the designedprimers was tested in silico using the BLAT or BLAST tool in
Genome Browser ( https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ) or Ensembl ( http://
www.ensembl.org/index.html ). Primers were tested as described
(Bustin et al,2009 ). Primer sequences are reported in
Appendix Table S1. Quantification data, obtained in qRT –PCR reac-
tions on cDNAs obtained from different treatments, are expressed interms of cycle thresholds (Ct). The HPRT and GAPDH genes were
used as endogenous reference controls for experiments. The Ct val-ues were averaged for each in-plate technical triplicate. The aver-aged Ct was normalized as difference in Ct values ( DCt) between
the analyzed mRNAs and each reference gene in each sample ana-lyzed. The DCt values of each sample were then normalized with
respect to the DCt values of the control ( DDCt). The variation was
reported as fold change (2

Protein isolation and Western blotting (WB)
Optic cup samples for total protein extraction were homogenized in
RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail 100 ×(Sigma) and
phosSTOP-Easypack phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche).Protein extract concentrations were determined using the Bio-Radprotein assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 30 lg protein from each sample
was loaded in SDS –polyacrylamide gels. For WB, gels were elec-
troblotted onto PVDF filters (Millipore) and sequentially immunos-tained with the following primary antibodies: anti-Atp5A, anti-Uqcrc2, anti-Mtco1, anti-Sdhb, anti-NdufB8 (Abcam, Total OXPHOSRodent WB Antibody Cocktail ab110413, 1:250); anti-Drp1 (Abcam,ab184247; 1:1,000); anti-TTC11/Fis1 (Abcam, ab229969; 1:1,000);anti-Opa1 (BD Biosciences, 612607; 1:1,000); anti-Mfn1 (Abcam,ab57602; 1:200); anti-Mfn2 (Abcam, ab56889, 1:1,000); anti-CitrateSynthase (Abcam, ab9660, 1:1,000); anti-Stat3 (Cell Signaling,ab30835, 1:1,000); anti-p507-Stat3 (Cell signaling, ab4113, 1:1,000);anti-p727-Stat3 (Cell Signaling, ab9134, 1:1,000); anti-p115 (SantaCruz, sc-48363, 1:3,000); anti-Gapdh (Santa Cruz sc-32233,1:3,000). Proteins of interest were detected with horseradishperoxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody(1:3,000, GE Healthcare) visualized with the Luminata Crescendosubstrate (Millipore) or the Super Signal West Femto substrate(Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. WBimages were acquired using the Chemidoc-lt imaging system (UVP),and band intensity was calculated using the ImageJ software. Thesignals for each protein staining were quantified and then normal-ized for Gapdh or p115 in the same sample (internal normalization).These normalized values were then compared with the values in thecontrol sample. Only bands on the same blot were compared. Theaverage of the normalized values from three different biologicalreplicates is reported as the relative fold change.
TUNEL assay
For TUNEL assay, mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryoprotected
with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and cryosectioned. TUNELassay was performed using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche)
as described (Indrieri et al,2013 ). Only sections in which the optic
nerve was contained were analyzed with a Leica DM-5500 micro-scope, and TUNEL-positive cells were manually counted and nor-malized per section. The TUNEL count was performed on threeeyes/genotype on at least six sections/eye that contain the opticnerve. For the analysis of photoreceptor cell death in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes ( N=4; four sections/
eye that contain the optic nerve) and in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injectedones ( N=3; four sections/eye that contain the optic nerve), only
GFP-positive areas were taken into account for the count of TUNEL-positive cells, and the data were normalized per area.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis
For immunofluorescence analysis, mouse eyes were fixed in 4%
PFA, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, andcryosectioned. Fourteen-micrometer cryosections was collected onslides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Sectionswere permeabilized by incubation with 1% NP40 for 15 min forRhodopsin and C-Arrestin immunostaining, or by boiling in sodiumcitrate buffer (0.1 M citric acid, 0.1 M sodium citrate in water) forCaspase 3 active staining or in citrate buffer (0.01 M citric acid inwater) for citrate synthase and Stat3 staining. After 1-min boiling,the slides were cooled down at room temperature. The followingprimary antibodies were incubated overnight: anti-Rhodopsin(Abcam, ab3267, 1:5,000); anti-C-Arrestin (Millipore, 1:1,000); anti-Recoverin (Sigma-Aldrich, AB5585, 1:500); anti-Citrate Synthase(Abcam, ab9660, 1:500); anti-Stat3 (Cell Signaling, ab30835, 1:100);anti-Caspase 3 active (R&D System, AF385, 1:1,000). Sections werethen incubated with the Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1,000;Invitrogen). Phalloidin staining was performed washing cryosec-tions three times in PTW1 ×, blocking for 1 h in PTW1 ×+10% FBS
and then sections were incubated for 20 min with Phalloidin (Invit-rogen Alexa Fluor 568). For PNA staining, cryosections werewashed three times with PBS1 ×. The slides were incubated over
night with (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) (L7381,Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (VectorLaboratories). All the immunofluorescence stainings were acquiredusing a Zeiss LSM700 Confocal, with the exception of the CitrateSynthase staining that was acquired through a Zeiss LSM800 Confo-cal. Only sections in which the optic nerve was contained were usedand two images from each section were photographed in compara-ble regions equidistant from the optic nerve head. The fluorescentimages were converted to grayscale and normalized to backgroundstaining, using ImageJ. Quantification of each staining reactivitywas measured as mean values to define fluorescence signal intensity(IntDen/Area) and as the area occupied by fluorescent-labeling ineach region of interest.
Active-caspase 3-positive cells count
Immunostained sections for Active-casp3, in which the optic nerve
was contained, were analyzed with a Leica DM-5500 microscopeand positive cells were manually counted and normalized per sec-tion. The analysis was performed on 4 –6 eyes/genotype on at least
eight sections/eye that contain the optic nerve.
ONL thickness and count of nuclei in the ONL
Mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose,
embedded in OCT and cryosectioned. Fourteen-micrometer cryosec-tions was collected on slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pitts-burgh, PA), and washed three times with PTW1 ×. The sections
were then incubated with DAPI in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)1×for 10 min. Count of nuclei in ONL was performed on three
eyes/genotype (at least two sections per eye) at p30. Only sectionsin which the optic nerve was contained were used, and two imagesfrom each section were photographed under a Leica DM-5500microscope, with the objective Leica ∞/0.17/D, HCX PL FLUOTAR,
40×/0.75 that acquires an area of 0.31 mm
2, in comparable regions
equidistant from the optic nerve head (Barbato et al,2017 ; Karali
et al,2020 ; Ciampi et al,2022 ; Intartaglia et al,2022 ). The acquired
images were used for nuclei counts. DAPI-positive nuclei in ONLwere count manually using ImageJ program and normalized perarea. On the same images, the ONL thickness was manually
14of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 |2022 /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et almeasured using ImageJ program, by measuring the distance
between the Henle’s fiber layer (HFL) and the outer limiting mem-brane (OLM). The same analysis was performed at p90 on N≥3
eyes/genotype (at least two sections per eye).
Electron microscopy, outer segment (OS) length analysis and
mitochondrial phenotype analysis
Mice, at p12 and p30, were deeply anesthetized and perfused with
1% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 200 mM Hepes Buffer, pH 7.3through the heart. Eyes were removed, and under a dissectionmicroscope, the eyeball was cut along the line between the anteriorand posterior chambers of the eye using Spring scissors (FineScience Tools). Lens were removed and the retina and RPE was leftfor 1 h in the described fixative solution. Specimens of retina +RPE
were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embeddedin epoxy resin. Retina samples were cut on ultramicrotome LEICAEM UC7 and collected on the single slot oval grids and analyzedwith FEI electron microscope. Only tissue sections in which thesagittal orientation of the connecting cilium (cc) was visible werechosen, as shown in Appendix Fig S1. We analyzed two eyes/geno-
type on at least 10 images per eye, for a total number of OS mea-sured of around 200 OS for the P347S and 150 OS for the P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0. These data are represented as mean /C6SEM (Stan-
dard Error of the Mean). The researchers in charge of producing theTEM images were blind to the genotypes of the animals.
The mitochondrial characterization was performed for all mito-
chondria located within the entire inner segment (IS), from theouter limiting membrane to the outer segment (OS) with nascentdisks (see Appendix Fig S2), observing that the changes in shape
and size that we report are independent from localization within theIS. We analyzed mitochondrial number, perimeter, and area on sev-eral TEM images derived from two eyes/genotypes each time point,for a total number of images analyzed of 22/genotype for each timepoint of analysis. Mitochondrial number was determined using FEIsoftware. Mitochondrial surface area and perimeter were analyzedon the same images using the iTEM software, and these data arerepresented normalized per field, as previously reported (Costaet al,2010 ; Naon et al,2016 ; Quintana-Cabrera et al,2018 ; Indrieri
et al,2019 ; Tsakiri et al,2019 ; Xia et al,2019 ; Ozaki et al,2020 ;
Anastasia et al,2021 ; Mirra et al,2021 ). The researchers in charge
of producing the TEM images were blind to the genotypes of theanimals.
Electroretinogram
Mice were dark reared for 3 h and anesthetized. Flash ERGs were
evoked by 10-ms light flashes generated through a Ganzfeld stimula-tor (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Florence, Italy) and reg-istered as previously described (Botta et al,2016 ; Indrieri et al,
2019 ) ERGs and b-wave thresholds were assessed using the follow-
ing protocol. Eyes were stimulated with light flashes increasing from/C05.2 to +1.3 log cd *s/m
2(which correspond to 1 ×10/C05.2to
20.0 cd *s/m2) in scotopic conditions. For ERG analysis in scotopic
conditions, the responses evoked by 11 stimuli (from /C05.2 to +1.3
log cd *s/m2) with an interval of 0.6 log unit were considered. To
minimize the noise, three ERG responses were averaged at each 0.6log unit stimulus from /C05.2 to 0.0 log cd *s/m
2while one ERGresponse was considered for higher stimuli (from 0.0 to +1.3 log
cd*s/m2). a- and b-waves amplitudes recorded in scotopic condi-
tions were plotted as a function of increasing light intensity (from/C04t o +1.3 log cd *s/m
2). The photopic ERG was recorded after the
scotopic session by stimulating the eye with ten 10 ms flashes of20.0 cd *s/m
2over a constant background illumination of 50 cd/m2.
Optokinetic tracking
Visual acuity of mice was assessed by using the Optomotor system
(OptoMotry; Cerebral Mechanics) as previously described (Indrieriet al,2019 ). Briefly, the OptoMotry machine (CerebralMechanics
Inc.) is constituted by a plexiglass box [39 ×39×32.5 cm
(L×W×H)] with rectangular openings [33.5 ×26.5 cm (W ×H)]
on each wall painted flat white on the inside (screens). Inside thebox, a platform is positioned 13 cm above the floor by securing awhite Plexiglas disk (diameter, 5.3 cm). Above and below thescreens, there are two mirrors and a camera at the top that allowsone to follow the behavior of the animal. The computer program(OptoMotry; CerebralMechanics, Lethbride, Alberta, Canada) wasused to control the rotation speed and the geometry of the stimuli aswell as the spatial frequency and contrast of the stimuli. Analyseshave been conducted twice, at two different time points (p40 andp90), by increasing the spatial frequency for each direction of rota-tion (right/left), after an initial trial of 10 min. The maximum spa-tial frequency that the animal is able to perceive is recorded as athreshold of visual acuity and reported in the graph as cycles/degreeon the y-axis.
Pupillary light response
Pupillary light responses from rd10 mice were recorded in dark con-
dition using the TRC-50IX retinal camera connected to a charge-
coupled device NikonD1H digital camera (Topcon Biomedical Sys-tems), as previously described (Tornabene et al,2019 ). Briefly, mice
were exposed to 10 lux light-stimuli for approximately 10 s and onepicture per eye was acquired using the IMAGEnet software (TopconBiomedical Systems). For each eye, the pupil diameter was normal-ized to the eye diameter (from temporal to nasal side).
Water maze test
We used a modified version of the visual water maze task (Mar-
rocco et al,2020 ) consisting of a circular tank of 1.4-m diameter
gray metal, high 40 cm. A visible black platform was 13 cm high,protruding 1 cm above the water (21 /C62°C) that was made white
with natural color and was positioned in a well-lit room. The northsite the pool contained a divisor panel. Across trials, the platformwas randomly located on the right and left side equidistant from thedivisor. The animal was always released from the south quadrant,and the latency to reach the platform was recorded by using thevideo tracking AnyMaze (Stoelting, USA). Black curtains were posi-tioned around the pool to limit distal cues; the access to distal cueswas prevented by the wall of the pool. To acclimatize the mice tothe platform, the training started with the animal positioned on theplatform for 60 s, before the first training session was administered.Training consisted of two sessions per day of six trials for two 2 con-secutive days. Every two consecutive trials animals rested for
/C2112022 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 |2022 15of19Sabrina Carrella et al EMBO Molecular Medicine10 min within sessions. The position of the platform is randomly
displaced every two trials. Intersession interval was about. Subjectswere given up to 120 s to escape during each trial; if they did notescape within the allotted time, they were gently guided to the plat-form and their escape time was recorded as this maximum. All miceremained on the platform between trials, then after each block theywere towel-dried, and transferred to their home cages under warmair. Behavioral data were acquired with a latency to reach the plat-form during the training trials. All measurements were monitoredby a video camera.
FEDRATINIB ex vivo retina treatment
P347S and P347S/miR-181a/b-1
+//C0animals were sacrificed by cervi-
cal dislocation, following the institution’s guidelines, at p30. Eyes
were removed quickly using Dumont’s forceps #5 and put in CO2-independent medium —Gibco (18045-054). Under a dissection
microscope, the eyeball was opened and cut along the line betweenthe anterior and posterior chambers of the eye using Spring scissors(Fine Science Tools). Lens were removed and the retina and RPE,attached in the inferior part of the eyeball, was dissected out using#5 forceps and flat-mounted retina/RPE was placed in a new dishcontaining Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with10% FBS (Euroclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The ex vivo
retinas were treated with the JAK2 inhibitor FEDRATINIB(SAR302503, TG101348; Selleckchem) 100 lM for 8 h. Control reti-
nas were treated with DMSO.
Sponge design, construct, and AAV preparation
We previously generated miR-181a/b sponge construct (Barbato et al,
2021 ). The sequence is covered by the patent application “miR-181
inhibitors and uses thereof” (WO2019202162A1). MiR-181a/b sponge
was cloned in a vector, containing an expression cassette, into the 3
0
UTR of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, under the con-trol of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) constitutive promoter. To specifi-cally overexpress sponge-miR-181a/b in rod PRs, we prepared anexpression cassette in which the GFP-sponge-miR-181a/b is under thecontrol of the human RHO promoter (Botta et al,2016 ), and for the
RPE-specific overexpression, we used the promoter of the humanVMD2 gene (Esumi et al,2004 ). We generated AAV2/8 vectors
expressing “sponge” constructs to achieve long-term loss-of-functionof miR-181a/b in vivo (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b;
AAV2/8.RHO.GFP- Sponge-miR-181a/b; AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b). Vectors, driving the expression of GFP under the controlof the same promoters (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP; AAV2/8.RHO.GFP andAAV2/8.VMD2.GFP), were used as controls. Recombinant AAV2/8viruses were produced by the TIGEM Vector Core as reported(Hildinger et al,2001 ;D o r i a et al,2013 ).
Plasmids used for AAV vector production are as follows: the pAd
helper plasmid that contains the adenovirus E2A, E4, and VA RNAhelper genes (Zhang et al, 2000 ); the pAAV2/8 (Gao et al, 2002 )p a c k -
aging plasmid with AAV rep2 and cap8 genes; the pAAV2.1 plasmidthat contains the expression cassette flanked by two identical invertedterminal repeats (ITRs), the ampicillin resistance and the bovinegrowth hormone polyadenylation signal (bGH) (Auricchio et al,2001 ).
Adeno-associated viral vectors were produced by triple transfec-
tion of HEK293 cells and were purified by two rounds of CsCl2gradients as already described (Doria et al,2013 ). Physical titers
[genome copies per milliliter (GC/ml)] of each viral preparationwere determined by averaging the titer achieved by dot-blot analysisand by PCR quantification using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems,Carlsbad, CA) (Doria et al,2013 ).
Subretinal injections
Surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all
efforts were made to minimize suffering. Viral vectors were deliv-ered subretinally in the dorsal retinal areas via a trans-scleral tran-schoroidal approach (Liang et al,2000 ). Eyes were injected with
1ll of AAV vector (specified in each figure) containing a total of
1×10
13viral GCs.
We excluded from our analysis samples that showed sign of
injection-related damages, or eyes that turned out to be not properlyinjected as assessed from GFP expression analysis. The fluorescenceof eye fundi were acquired using a TRC-50IX retinal camera con-nected to a charge-coupled device NikonD1H digital camera (Top-con Biomedical Systems). Retinal sections were also analyzed todetermine the GFP expression and images acquired using the TILE-SCAN function at the Leica DM-5500 microscope.
Statistical analysis
Animals were allocated to experimental and control groups ran-
domly based on the appropriate genotype/conditions/treatments. Ingeneral, for each experiment, we used ≥3 animals per genotype, in
order to obtain statistically suitable values. EM analysis, behavioral,and visual tests were carried out blinded. The number of experimen-tal replicates is indicated in each figure legend. The normalityassumption was verified using Shapiro –Wilk test. In all experi-
ments, significance of differences between groups was evaluated byThe paper explained
Problem
Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders
affecting the retina characterized by photoreceptor cell death, pro-gressive loss of vision and blindness. Their high genetic heterogeneity,with over 250 different causative genes, represents an important limi-
tation to the development of gene therapy approaches that can beapplied to a significant number of patients. Therefore, the establish-ment of therapeutic approaches for IRDs independent on the geneticdefect and aimed at slowing down disease progression represents ahigh priority.
Results
Here, we show that the inhibition in the retina of two small RNAmolecules, namely microRNAs miR- 181a and miR- 181b (miR- 181a/b),
exerts a beneficial effect in vivo in different models of IRDs, by delay-
ing disease progression. We also observed a beneficial effect on mito-
chondria defects observed in these IRDs models.
Impact
Our findings represent a solid proof-of-principle of the usefulness ofmiR- 181a/b inhibition to counteract disease progression in IRDs and
pave the way toward the development of an innovative gene-independent therapeutic strategy for retinal diseases with mitochon-drial involvement.
