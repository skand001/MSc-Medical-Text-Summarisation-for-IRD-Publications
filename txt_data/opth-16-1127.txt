Background: To assess the prevalence of genetic testing for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) in a tertiary practice setting.
Methods: Single-centre retrospective analysis of patients with diagnosed or suspected IRD.
Results:Fourhundredandsixty-fourpatientrecordswereanalysed.PatientshadreceivedcarefordifferentIRDsgroupedasfollows:
panretinal pigmentary retinopathies (283, 61%), macular dystrophies (136, 29.3%), stationary diseases (23, 5%), hereditary vitreor-
etinopathies (14, 3%), and other IRDs (8, 1.7%). The suspected pattern of inheritance of patients’ IRD was predominantly autosomal
recessive (205, 44.2%). Genetic testing was performed with the corresponding results available for 44 patients (9.5%). Diagnostic
yieldwas65.9%fortheresultsreceived.Genetictestresultswereavailablemostlyforyoungerpatients(13.1%for<45yearsvs6.2%
≥45 years of age, p = 0.01) and those who received greater than 12 months of care (16% for ≥12 months vs 4% for <12 months, p <
0.01). For patients without genetic testing results, reasons include awaiting a geneticist consultation (17.9%), awaiting test results
(4.5%), or patient refusal (8.4%). Most clinical records (69.2%) did not document genetic testing status.
Conclusion: Genetic testing is increasingly being utilised in the work-up for patients with IRD worldwide. This large Australian
privatepracticeIRDcohortshowsalowuptakeoftesting(around10%),reflectinghistoricalmanagementpatternsandaccessibilityof
genetic counselling and testing. The results show that younger patients and those with a longer duration of care were more likely to
have received genetic testing. As the importance of IRD genetic testing continues to increase, we expect to see a change in patient
management within the Australian private ophthalmology system and testing rates to increase. Further research is required to identify
and address clinician and patient barriers to improving genetic testing rates for IRD.

1 in 1000 individuals.1,2IRDs are now the most common cause of legal blindness in adults of working age in Australia3
and the United Kingdom (UK).4Previous experimental treatments for IRD have included Vitamin A supplementation,
valproate,5ciliary neurotrophic factor supplementation6and electrical stimulation through the skin7or cornea,8but their
efficacies are unclear, and none have reached regulatory approval.

Published: 13 April 2022Assessment of eligibility for ocular gene therapies requires identification of patients’ pathogenic genetic variant.
Therefore, genetic testing is recommended as standard of care in Australia11and internationally.12In addition to
exploring potential gene therapy opportunities, genetic testing is recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis and
inheritance of the condition, which may inform prognosis for patients and their family members, including family
planning considerations.13–15
Genetic testing has evolved over the years, allowing case-by-case selection of appropriate molecular testing
strategies.16While Sanger sequencing is typically chosen for suspected monogenic disorders, more advanced methods
suchasnext-generationsequencing(NGS)andwhole-exomesequencing(WES)areavailableforpatientswithuncertain
clinical diagnoses and/or inheritance patterns.16These novel methods have increased the success rate of IRD genetic
testing (defined as identification of at least one pathogenic variation) to between 56% and 76% in most developed
countries.14,17–19The success of genetic testing in identifying the disease-causing variant varies depending on patients’
specific diagnosis,17age,20and whether the responsible gene and/or pathogenic variant has been previously identified in
IRD patients and/or family members.21New developments in testing methodology and gene therapy have further
highlighted the important role of genetic testing for IRDs.
A recent study by Strait et al (2020) explored self-reported genetic testing practices of optometrists and ophthalmol-
ogists managing patients with IRDs in the US.15Respondents indicated that while there are discussions surrounding
genetics(64.7% and70.6% of theclinicians reportedtaking family historyof IRD and explaininginheritance patternsto
their IRD patients, respectively), 78.4% of the clinicians have not ordered genetic testing for their patients with IRD.15
Reported reasons for not completing genetic testing included the opinion that genetic test results do not alter IRD
patients’ clinical management, lack of clinicians’ confidence in their ability to order the appropriate test, preference to
refer to experienced clinicians, and/or patient refusal.15
To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring the rate and outcomes of IRD genetic testing ordered by Australian
ophthalmologistsinaclinicalprivatetertiarycaresetting.Thisstudysoughttoevaluatethecurrentprevalenceofgenetic

aim to reassess in several years to observe the changes following the recent Royal Australian and New Zealand College
of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) IRD management guidelines,11which have highlighted the need for more widespread
genetic testing with the availability of gene-based therapies for these patients.
Methods
This retrospective analysis involved evaluation of electronic medical records of pre-existing patients of Eye Surgery
Associates,alargeprivateophthalmicpracticeinVictoria,Australia,with18sub-specialtyophthalmologists.Patientsare
referred to this clinic for tertiary level medical retina care and/or diagnostic retinal electrophysiology services.
The senior author and ophthalmologist HM completed a search of the practice’s electronic database (VIP.net Version
Ruby, Best Practice Software, Bundaberg, QLD) to identify all confirmed or suspected IRD patients seen between 1995
and2021 using thefollowing search terms: retinitis pigmentosa (or abbreviation, RP), retinaldystrophy, cone dystrophy,
cone-rod dystrophy, macular dystrophy, Best, Stargardt, congenital stationary night blindness, monochromat, achroma-
topsia, Bietti, choroideremia, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, Usher, Wagner, gyrate and Sorsby.
After removing duplicate records, clinical records were reviewed by HM for accuracy of diagnosis, and those with
incorrect or uncertain diagnoses as documented by clinicians were excluded, including 20 cases of possible adult
vitelliform macular dystrophy, which were not possible to distinguish from age-related macular degeneration from
clinical records.
Data Collection
A two-stage clinical record review was undertaken by the senior author (HM), followed by two co-first authors
experienced in IRD (YJ, SG). The analysis was completed between June and August 2021. The senior author (HM) is
an experienced ophthalmologist in the management of medical retina disorders, particularly IRDs. Both co-first authors
are optometry trained with further training in research (MPhil, SG) and medicine (MD, YJ). Data were captured as

research team (YJ, SG, HM, LA, ACBJ) to obtain consensus.
The following de-identified information was collected, based only upon information available in the patient record:
patient age, gender (female, male, non-binary), duration of care at the practice (months), clinical diagnosis of IRD,
suspected mode of inheritance, history of consanguinity, and genetic testing results for the patient and/or family
members. Suspected mode of inheritance was determined through family history ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), and when
present, genetic test results of the patient and their family members.
If a genetic test report was available, the following data were collected: testing methodology (NGS, WES, Sanger
sequencing, microarray, unknown), clinical grade or research grade testing, and whether the pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variant was identified.
If no genetic test results were available, the status of planned testing was captured (awaiting geneticist, awaiting test
results,patientrefused,ornotfurtherspecified).Clinicalrecordsthatdidnotcapturewhethergenetictestingwasordered
or the patient’s response to genetic testing, were considered “not further specified.”
Data Management and Privacy
De-identifieddatawerecollectedusingREDCap,asecurewebapplicationforbuildingandmanagingonlinesurveysand
databases. REDCap includes a full analysis trail and specified user-based privileges. Access to study data in REDCap
was restricted to the members of the study team. Only de-identified data was exported for the purposes of analysis and
reporting.
Statistical Analysis
De-identified data were imported into R (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) for descriptive statistical analyses. IRD clinical
diagnosis was grouped into panretinal pigmentary retinopathies, macular dystrophies, stationary diseases, and hereditary
vitreoretinopathies according to Coco-Martin et al.22
Agesubgroupsarepresentedasyoungpatients(lessthan45yearsofage)versusolderpatients(45yearsandolder)as
an appropriate cut-off age for family planning23and childbearing.24The distribution of the data was explored and
comparison between subgroups was performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-parametric continuous variables
and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. An alpha value of 0.05 was used to define statistical significance. Binary
logisticregressionwasperformedusingIBM SPSSStatisticsforWindows,version27(IBMCorp.,Armonk,NY,USA),
to calculate the odds of patients having had genetic testing based on patients’ gender, age, and duration of care.
Ethics
All patients had provided written consent for their health information to be used for research, and audit purposes at the

Ophthalmologists of all reviewed patients gave permission for record access. This study was approved by the Human
Research Ethics committee of the RANZCO (#124.21) and abided by the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
An initial search of the database containing 194,716 unique patient records at Eye Surgery Associates revealed 541
patients withanIRD. Exclusionofincomplete patientrecords and/or incorrector uncertainclinicaldiagnoses resultedin
464 patient records in this retrospective study.

Genetic testing results were available in patients’ clinical records for 44 patients (9.5%). Genetic testing was performed
mostly for patients less than 45 years of age (13.1% for <45 years vs 6.2% ≥45 years of age, p=0.01) and those with
duration of care of 12 months or longer (16% for ≥12 months of care vs 4% for <12 months of care, p<0.01). For three
patients, immediate family members had genetic testing results available. While clinical information from a family
member or research grade testing is useful in a clinical setting, only patients who have undergone clinical testing
themselves were included in this analysis.
Reasons for not having genetic testing results available were documented as: awaiting an appointment with
a geneticist (75, 17.9%), awaiting test results following sample collection (19, 4.5%), and patient refusal of genetic
testing (35, 8.4%). However, in most cases, the reason was “not further specified” (290, 69.2%) ( Figure 2).
Multivariate logistic regression revealed that younger patients (OR: 2.95, p<0.01) and those with duration of care of
12 months or longer (OR: 5.48, p<0.01) are more likely to have had genetic testing performed ( Table 2). There was no
association between gender and the likelihood of patients having genetic testing results available (univariate OR: 0.79,
p=0.46).

reports, and there were two to three pathogenic variants identified per patient. No further familial testing data was
reported within the clinical records for any of the patients with an ABCA4gene mutation. Two patients had only one

Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)2020), improvements in genetic testing technologies, and slower introduction of genetic testing programs in Australia.
Sponsored IRD genetic testing programs were introduced in Australia in 2021 but have been available overseas for
several years. Access to free testing for patients undoubtedly has the potential to increase genetic testing uptake. In
addition, the RANZCO guidelines for IRD management,11which emphasise the importance of genetic testing for
a broader group of patients than previously thought beneficial, will change future practice. Finally, this practice is
a specialist tertiary care provider, where patients are often referred for specialised testing (such as electrophysiology or
confirmation ofdiagnosis, etc).Hence,there isa highpercentage of single-visit patientsin this cohort,which meansit is
less likely that genetic testing would have been discussed. The results of this study are intended as a benchmark of
historical practice (1995–2021), and we will reassess in the future to determine the changes due to the above factors.
The predominant phenotypic diagnosis in this patient cohort was retinitis pigmentosa/rod-cone dystrophy. Macular
dystrophy with flecks was the second most common IRD category, suggesting ABCA4retinopathy as the most common
macular IRD diagnosis. The distribution of IRD phenotypes in our cohort is similar to those reported in Spain,26,27the
US,14,28theUK,29Iran,30andNorway.31TheAustralianInheritedRetinalDiseaseRegistryandDNABankalsoreported
that retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt disease are the most common two diagnoses among over 9000 Australian
patients.32Table 3Frequency of Genes Identified During Genetic Testing

BEST1, USH2A, RHO, RP1, CRB1 . This compares well to other study cohorts in Brazil,31New Zealand33and UK.29
Similarly,astudybyMansfieldetal(2020)reportedthat ABCA4, USH2A, RHO, BEST1 andCRB1areamongthetop10

The diagnostic yield for genetic testing also varies depending on the provisional IRD diagnosis, testing methodology
and whether the IRD is genetically simple or exhibits complex disease phenotypes.38,39Jiman et al (2020) reported
a significant improvement in genetic diagnosis for people with a provisional clinical diagnosis compared to individuals
without a clinical diagnosis at the time of genetic testing (71% compared to 25%).39Furthermore, Li et al (2019)

Barriers to Genetic Testing
Among the patients who did not have genetic testing results available, 8.4% of clinical records documented patient
refusal; however, this figure may be higher since approximately 70% of clinical records did not have documented
counselling regarding genetic testing. It is important to consider the clinical context of genetic testing. At the time of
care, genetic testing was often clinically unjustified in many of our patients with an established IRD diagnosis, stable
clinical phenotype, or beyond reproductive age. Patient visits with the sole intention of providing legal blindness
certification to established IRD patients or performing single procedure services such as electroretinography were
considered exempt from genetic testing counselling and ordering.

Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Patient-related barriers to uptake of genetic testing have been explored in several studies. Li et al (2019) found that
patients were reluctant to agree to genetic testing due to cost involved, advanced age, mobility challenges due to poor
vision and difficulty arranging transportation among the visually impaired.40However, 73% of the eligible patients
consenttogenetictestingwhenatnocosttothem.40Recentlyannouncedindustrysponsoredtestingprograms(including
Invitae and the Blueprint/Novartis collaboration, both commencing in 2021) offer IRD patients free access to panel
testing in Australia, which may overcome this barrier. However, whether clinicians are aware of such programs remains
unknown. Previous studies also recognise patients’ education, family status and age affect acceptance of genetic
testing.23,41,42The main reasons for negative attitudes were due to the assumption that abortion rates will increase,
exposuretosocialdiscrimination,misuseofresultsbyorderingclinician,andanxietiessurroundingtheirownhealthand
thatoftheirchild’s.23,42Therefore,thereisaroleforclinicianstoearntheirpatients’trustandprovideinformativeadvice
regarding the advantages of genetic testing.
Inaddition,Neiweemetal(2021)recognisedthatmanycliniciansinmedicineandophthalmologyareunfamiliarwith
genetic testing due to the several complexities involved.43Clinicians may be unaware which patients are suitable
candidates, the appropriate test to order, how to interpret results, or the associated cost of genetic testing.21,43Further
education may be required to educate clinicians and patients regarding the benefits of genetic testing using informative
resources such as the Retina International Campaign, “Know Your Code” ( www.kyc.retinaint.org ).44Confoundingly,
there is also variation in testing guidelines between international and Australian guidelines, with international patient
advocacy groups such as Retina International detailing a need for global consensus in published guidelines.44The
RANZCO have recently published comprehensive IRD management guidelines, which emphasise the importance of
genetic testing in accordance with clinical benefits.11With emerging gene-dependent treatment options such as gene
therapy, it is important to screen IRD patients to facilitate appropriate referral for clinical trials efficiently when it
becomesavailable.Ofnote,inunsolvedcases,thecurrentliteraturerecommendsaretestintervalofatleast18months.45
Previously reported resource-related barriers to genetic testing include long turnaround times of genetic testing (up to 6
monthsinsomecases),46limitationsofgenetictestingmethods,39andlimitedintegrationofdifferentmedicalspecialitiessuch

Akeystrengthofourstudyistherelativelylargepatientcohort,consistingof464patientsfromasinglelargetertiary
ophthalmic practice. Furthermore, the study constituted a rigorous process of selecting appropriate patients using a two-
stage clinical record review by the senior author (HM), followed by an ophthalmology registrar (YJ) and an optometrist
experienced in IRD (SG) to assess clinical diagnoses and genetic testing results.
Study limitations include the large heterogeneity in patient follow-up duration, ranging from single visits to regular
patients attending for up to 27 years. The relatively high number of single visits at this clinic is due to high numbers of
referrals solely for electrophysiological testing, diagnosing patients and/or certifying legal blindness. Once patients
receive their clinical diagnosis, they return to their primary eyecare provider for ongoing management, who may have
ordered genetic testing however forwarded these results with patient referrals. Furthermore, the relatively high “not
further specified” reason for lack of genetic testing may be indicative of the variation of clinicians’ clinical record
documentation patterns that did not capture discussions, referrals, and/or patient opinions. For pathogenicity determina-
tion, we relied on information provided by the laboratory and/or geneticist or genetic counsellor available in patients’
clinical records. In some cases, the letter provided to the ophthalmologist contained only information on the name of the
affected gene and number of variants identified but no information on the specific variants.
In the future, we expect these figures to improve with availability of higher precision genetic testing methods, free
sponsored programs, FDA-approved gene therapy, and potentially greater awareness of genetic testing benefits. We aim
to repeat this study in 2 years, to assess the impact these policy and practice changes have on genetic test ordering for
people with IRD. Future research should evaluate genetic testing in the public system, as well as additional barriers,
policies, and patient perceptions of the genetic testing process in Australia.

Australia, compared to international studies. Currently, our cohort demonstrates that younger patients with longer
duration of care are more likely to have received genetic test results. This study provides a snapshot of ophthalmic
practices in genetic test ordering for definitive clinical diagnoses, establishing inheritance patterns, family planning, and
assessingpatients’suitabilityforgene-targetedtherapies,whichwillbeofinteresttomanygeneralandspecialisedretinal
ophthalmologists. We expect that the availability of sponsored testing programs and increased awareness relating to the
importance of genetic testing will increase uptake of genetic testing in the future. To achieve this, we advocate further
clinician and patient education based upon the established IRD guidelines (such as RANZCO11), streamlined access to
public genetic clinics, detailed and standardised reporting of genetic test results, continued support of large IRD
databases,andfundingforreduced-cost testingto improveongoing managementandclinical outcomesforIRDpatients.
