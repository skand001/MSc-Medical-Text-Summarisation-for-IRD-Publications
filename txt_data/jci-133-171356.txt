Introduction
Leber congenital amaurosis type 16 (LCA16; OMIM #614186) is 
a severe autosomal recessive inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) 
leading to blindness in early life. LCA16 is caused by the loss of 
function of the Kir7 .1 potassium ion channel (encoded by the 
KCNJ13 gene, location 2q37 .1, OMIM #603208) in the apical 
processes of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells of the 
eye (1, 2). The Kir7 .1 channel controls K+ homeostasis in the sub -
retinal space, supporting photoreceptor-RPE cell-cell signaling 
in support of visual functions, such as phototransduction and 
phagocytosis. Several missense and nonsense loss-of-function 
mutations have been reported in KCNJ13, leading to dimin-
ished K+ conductance and altered electroretinogram (ERG) of 
the RPE (3–10) .There is no therapy available for LCA16 patients in the clinic. 
An LCA16 mouse model with biallelic mutations in Kcnj13 does 
not survive long enough to test and develop possible therapeu-
tic strategies. We previously used induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) from a patient with the homozygous W53X mutation in 
KCNJ13 to derive RPE cells (LCA16 iPSC-RPE) as a model to test 
potential treatments such as translational readthrough-inducing 
drugs (TRIDs) and AAV-mediated gene augmentation (11) . How -
ever, these possible therapeutics have limitations. TRID-mediat -
ed readthrough will broadly affect the proteome and may result in 
the introduction of nonfunctional amino acids at the site of read-
through. AAV-mediated gene augmentation does not correct the 
underlying mutations. It may yield only a transient effect along -
side the innate and adaptive immune responses that diminishes 
their therapeutic effect, particularly if repeated doses are required.
In contrast, gene editing could, in principle, correct the endog -
enous gene and permanently reverse the underlying cause of 
the disease. However, editing using Cas nucleases is limited by 
the inefficiency of precise editing via homology-directed repair 
(HDR) in most retinal cell types (12–14) . Since HDR is inefficient 
in nondividing cells such as the RPE, most edited cells will acquire 
new indel mutations, and cells with 1 corrected allele frequently 
coinherit a disruptive indel allele. Moreover, double-strand DNA 
break (DSB) formation at the target site would pose the risk of Clinical genome editing is emerging for rare disease treatment, but one of the major limitations is the targeting 
of CRISPR editors’ delivery. We delivered base editors to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in the mouse 
eye using silica nanocapsules (SNCs) as a treatment for retinal degeneration. Leber congenital amaurosis type 16 
(LCA16) is a rare pediatric blindness caused by point mutations in the KCNJ13 gene, a loss of function inwardly 
rectifying potassium channel (Kir7.1) in the RPE. SNCs carrying adenine base editor 8e (ABE8e) mRNA and sgRNA 
precisely and efficiently corrected the KCNJ13W53X/W53X mutation. Editing in both patient fibroblasts (47%) and 
human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE (LCA16-iPSC-RPE) (17%) showed minimal off-target editing. We 
detected functional Kir7.1 channels in the edited LCA16-iPSC-RPE. In the LCA16 mouse model (Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R), RPE 
cells targeted SNC delivery of ABE8e mRNA preserved normal vision, measured by full-field electroretinogram 
(ERG). Moreover, multifocal ERG confirmed the topographic measure of electrical activity primarily originating 
from the edited retinal area at the injection site. Preserved retina structure after treatment was established 
by optical coherence tomography (OCT). This preclinical validation of targeted ion channel functional rescue, a 
challenge for pharmacological and genomic interventions, reinforced the effectiveness of nonviral genome-editing 
therapy for rare inherited disorders.Nonviral base editing of KCNJ13 mutation preserves

DNA sequence without requiring DSBs or relying on cellular HDR 
machinery. Since the c.158G>A nucleotide change causes KCNJ13 
mutation W53X, an ABE-mediated base-editing strategy can 
potentially correct the mutation through an A>G conversion. To 
screen ABEs and validate the sgRNAs for their ability to edit this 
pathogenic locus with functional restoration of the Kir7 .1 channel, 
we generated human embryonic kidney cells that stably express 
GFP-tagged KCNJ13-W53X (HEKW53X/W53X) and an isogenic 
WT control line (HEKWT /WT) in which the WT KCNJ13 sequence 
was inserted into a single Flp-In recognition target (FRT) site at 
a transcriptionally active genomic locus (Figure 1, A and B ). We 
chose the ABE8e base-editing effector due to its high efficien-
cy (34, 35)  and designed sgRNAs based on the predicted editing 
window at protospacer positions 4–8, counting the protospacer 
adjacent motif (PAM) as position number 21–23. Only 1 of the 3 
sgRNAs (G*C*G*CUAGCGUUGGAUGAUGU, PAM; TGG) was 
predicted to have high specificity while also placing the c158G>A 
position within the editing window of ABE8e (Figure 1C ).
We observed 99.7% (99.7% ± 0.1%) transfection efficiency in 
HEK293 cells by electroporation of 3 μ g of GFP mRNA (Supple -
mental Figure 3 , A–C). Therefore, we tested the activity of ABE8e 
in mRNA and protein formulations via electroporation. HEKW53X 
cells were electroporated with either a mixture of ABE8e mRNA 
and sgRNA or ABE8e:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) com-
plexes. Deep-sequencing analysis was performed on the treated 
cells by isolating RNA instead of DNA to distinguish the insert -
ed allele from the endogenous allele of the HEK genome. The 
pool of electroporated HEKW53X cells showed significantly higher  
AT-to-GC correction efficiency with ABE8e mRNA (53.0% ± 
1.4%) compared with ABE8e RNP (31.4% ± 3.4%) (Figure 1D ). 
Our on-target analysis showed comparatively lower indels intro -
duced using RNP (1.0% ± 0.4%) than mRNA (4.2% ± 1.6%) at 
and around the protospacer (Figure 1E ).
The W53X nonsense mutation in KCNJ13 disrupts its protein 
expression in HEKW53X cells, so we assessed whether base editing 
restored Kir7 .1 expression and subcellular localization at the pro -
tein level. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the Kir7 .1 
protein is present in the membrane in most of the base-edited 
HEKW53X cells, similar to control HEKWT cells. On the other hand, 
the fluorescence signal in untreated HEKW53X cells is accumulated 
in the cytoplasm and nucleus due to its premature truncation (Fig -
ure 1F). These results confirmed the successful translation and 
trafficking of full-length protein after editing (Figure 1F).
To determine Kir7 .1 channel function, whole-cell currents 
were recorded using an automated patch-clamp system from 
pools of either base-edited HEKW53X cells, untreated HEKW53X 
mutant cells, or untreated HEKWT cells ( Figure 2, A–C ). In a 
standard external physiological HEPES Ringer (HR) solution, 
HEKWT cells had a considerable negative membrane potential 
(–74.2 ± 4.2 mV, n = 3 individual cells) (Supplemental Figure 
4A). They exhibited an inward rectifying average Kir7 .1 current 
of –45.0 ± 11.3 pA (n  = 62 individual cells) at –150 mV in 5 mM K+. 
The inward current increased in response to external 140 mM 
Rb+ (a known activator of the Kir7 .1 channel) by 4.5-fold (–204.9 
± 37 .3 pA) (Supplemental Figure 4B ). However, the current was 
not blocked by adding 20 mM Cs+ (a known blocker of the Kir7 .1 
channel) to the bath solution (–41.5 ± 11.2 pA), suggesting a low uncontrolled indels and other undesired cellular consequences, 
such as chromosomal translocations, large deletions, aneuploidy, 
p53 activation, chromothripsis, or transposon insertions (15–24). 
Base editing has the potential to overcome these limitations by 
capitalizing on the RNA-guided programmability of CRISPR/
Cas9 to deliver a base-modification enzyme that can site specif -
ically convert 1 single nucleotide to another (25) .
Most base editors (BE) use a Cas9 nickase fused to an engi-
neered or evolved deaminase enzyme (26–28). Adenine base 
editors (ABEs) install A>G changes, while cytosine base editors 
(CBEs) install C>T changes, both within a small editing window 
specified by the sgRNAs (29) . Base editing does not rely on HDR 
and therefore tends to be efficient in nondividing cells. While 
delivery of the larger base editor effectors can be challenging, 
nonviral silica nanocapsules (SNCs) provide certain advantages in 
that they can transiently and cell specifically deliver a variety of 
payloads, including nucleic acids and proteins, without integrat -
ing into the genome, with decent payload-loading content (~10 
wt%) and encapsulation efficiency (>90%) for all of the biologics 
mentioned above (30–32). We recently reported that SNCs dec-
orated with all-trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) could achieve tissue- 
specific delivery to RPE cells via subretinal injection. This pro -
vides an unrealized opportunity to explore SNC-mediated base 
editor delivery for precise gene correction in LCA16 (33) .
Here, we explored the ability of an SNC-delivered base edi-
tor to correct the endogenous pathogenic W53X KCNJ13 point 
mutation in (a) patient-derived fibroblasts, (b) iPSC-derived RPE, 
(c) heterozygous knockin Kcnj13W53X/+ mice, and (d) WT allele– 
disrupted Kcnj13W53X/+ΔR mice via subretinal injection. Adenine 
base editor 8e (ABE8e) substantially outperformed a CRISPR/
Cas9 HDR strategy in terms of efficiency and editing precision. 
SNC-mediated delivery was sufficient to achieve approximately 
16% editing of RPE cells in the mouse retina. Moreover, the high 
editing efficiency of 47% in patient-derived fibroblasts suggests 
the opportunity to pursue cell therapies using the engraftment of 
autologous edited and reprogrammed cells. We then demonstrate 
functional restoration of the Kir7 .1 channel in patient-derived 
iPSC-RPE and in vivo in the LCA16 mouse (Kcnj13W53X/+ΔR) model, 
further revealing the potential of CRISPR base editing to preserve 
vision in LCA16 patients. Our work provides essential proof of 
concept that base editing via SNC delivery is a viable strategy for 
preventing the progression of inherited retinal diseases, particu-
larly channelopathies such as LCA16.
Results
ABE8e mRNA efficiently corrects the HEKW53X/W53Xcell line . Given 
the relatively low efficiency and heterogeneous outcomes of the 
traditional Cas9 nuclease-mediated gene-editing approach (Sup -
plementary Note, Supplemental Figure 1, A –D, and Supplemen-
tal Figure 2 , A–H; supplemental material available online with 
this article; https:/ /doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356DS1), we focused 
on base editing to correct the W53X mutation. Base editors are 
engineered proteins that use the programmable DNA-targeting 
ability of Cas9 to bring a nucleotide base–modifying enzyme to 
a precise editing window at the target DNA site. We used 3 bio -
informatic tools for sgRNA design (see Methods). These guides 
directed BE, to convert one or more bases, resulting in an altered The Journal of Clinical Investigation    RESEARCH ARTICLE3 J Clin Invest. 2023;133(19):e171356  https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356
Efficient ex vivo base editing in patient-specific fibroblasts using 
nanoparticles . To explore the specificity of ABE at the endogenous 
human KCNJ13 locus within patient-specific cells, we encapsulat -
ed ABE8e mRNA and sgRNA in SNC-PEG (SNC covalently con-
jugated with polyethylene glycol [PEG]) nanocapsules (Figure 3A ) 
(33)  for delivery into fibroblasts derived from an LCA16 (W53X 
homozygous) patient (FibroW53X/W53X). Five days after treatment, 
we assessed base-editing efficiency using deep sequencing. As 
expected, the activity of ABE8e yielded efficient AT-to-GC edit -
ing (52.3% ± 0.1%) at the target W53X site (A6). Cells from both 
the treated and untreated populations (Supplemental Figure 5 , 
A–C) had low levels of other substitutions (or possibly sequencing 
error) in the amplicon, including bystander A>G and other T>G, 
T>C, and G>A substitutions, with ABE8e exhibiting 6.5% ± 1.4% 
unwanted substitutions and untreated FibroW53X/W53X cells show -
ing 2.6% ± 0.1% unwanted substitutions (Figure 3B ). Rare indel Cs+ sensitivity of the Kir7 .1 channel (Figure 2A ), as reported 
earlier (1, 34) . These responses were not observed in untreated 
HEKW53X mutant cells, with a significantly lower resting current 
amplitude (–9.7 ± 1.3 pA) and negligible change upon adding Rb+ 
or Cs+ (Figure 2B ). Importantly, base-edited HEKW53X/W53X cells 
exhibited restored Kir7 .1 function in 80% of cells (n  = 60) and 
the characteristic Rb+-responsive K+ current (–33.3 ± 7 .7 pA base -
line; –415.2 ± 54.0 pA with Rb+, –42.2 ± 9.6 pA with Cs+) (Figure 
2C). The K+ current profile of 20% of the treated HEKW53X cells 
(n = 15) was comparable to that of mutant HEKW53X/W53X untreat -
ed cells (n  = 40), which we attribute as unedited cells (K+ current 
in HR; –30.9 ± 8.0 pA, Rb+; –57 .7 ± 12.5 pA, Cs+; –13.9 ± 5.1 pA) 
(Figure 2C ). From these experiments, we conclude that ABE8e 
mRNA plus sgRNA delivery can correct the W53X mutation at 
high efficiency (around 50% of total alleles and in 80% of cells), 
restoring Kir7 .1 protein levels and K+ conductance.

on-target corrections could have a beneficial outcome while 
avoiding detrimental bystander mutations. Unfortunately, the 
treated cells showed substantially lower AT-to-GC editing effi-
ciency (14.9% ± 1.7%; P  = 0.000027) than ABE8e at the target 
W53X site (A6). Undesired editing outcomes were also reduced: 
bystander editing at A14; 0.1% ± 0.1%, A–2; 0.1% ± 0.1%, A–4; 0.2% 
± 0.1%, other observed substitutions (4.7% ± 0.8%), and indels 
(1.4% ± 0.4%) in the amplicon (Supplemental Figure 6 , A–C). 
These results confirmed that ABEs, particularly ABE8e, can effi-
ciently revert the endogenous W53X nonsense mutation to WT 
in patient-derived fibroblasts.
Restoration of Kir7 .1 channel function in patient-derived iPSC-
RPE. Next, as a model for in vivo gene-editing therapies for 
LCA16, we applied our base-editing strategy to patient iPSC-  
derived RPE harboring homozygous W53X mutation in KCNJ13. 
Previous reports suggest that delivery into RPE by lipofection is outcomes were detected in the ABE8e-treated samples (2.7% ± 
0.4%) ( Figure 3B ). Bystander A>G editing near the target nucleo -
tide was rare in the ABE8e-treated samples (A14; 0.3% ± 0.0%, A17; 
0.1% ± 0.0%) (Figure 3C ). We also marked some ABE8e activity 
upstream of the protospacer at positions A–2 (0.3% ± 0.0%) and 
A–9 (0.1% ± 0.1%) (Figure 3C ). This bystander editing within and 
outside the protospacer resulted in silent (L48L) and missense 
(D50G, M51V, M56V, M57V) mutations (Figure 3D ). Although 
these mutations were observed at a very low frequency (<1%) in 
FibroW53X/W53X (Figure 3E ), it is possible to employ clonal selection 
of treated fibroblasts before iPSC generation and select a line that 
carries no bystander/incorrect edits.
In FibroW53X/W53X, we also assessed the activity of another ABE 
mRNA (ABE7 .10max) that has reduced activity and may reduce 
bystander mutations (Supplemental Figure 6 , A–C). This partic-
ular ABE mRNA could be advantageous in cases in which fewer

challenging. Also, transient expression of BE machinery is pre -
ferred over long-term expression via AAVs to restrict off-target  
editing that may accumulate during prolonged exposure to 
genome editors. So we used SNC-PEG as a delivery vector for 
ABE8e mRNA. We observed 27 .4% ± 1.7% transfection effi-
ciency in iPSC-RPE cells using SNC-PEG (Supplemental Fig -
ure 7D ). We did not observe any toxicity in the ABE8e-treated 
iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X, and cell morphology was comparable to that 
for untreated iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X (Figure 4A ). Deep-sequencing 
analysis in the base-edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X revealed 17 .8% ± 
1.5% editing of the mutant nucleotide to the WT sequence fol-
lowing ABE8e treatment (Figure 4B ). Fewer than 4% of resultant 
alleles carried undesired genomic outcomes: indels quantified 
in treated RPE had a frequency of 0.7% compared with 0.01% 
in untreated controls, and bystander substitutions quantified in 
treated RPE totaled 2.9% ± 0.4% compared with 1.8% ± 0.1% in 
untreated controls (Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 7 , A–C).
Manual patch-clamp electrophysiology was carried out on the 
pool of base-edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells ( Figure 4D ) to assess 
the functional rescue of the Kir7 .1 channel. Three types of Kir7 .1 
current profiles were observed in the edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X 
pool. Some of the cells (n  = 5 out of 13) showed a normal amplitude 
of K+ conductance (–102.0 ± 0.1 pA) in HR solution, which was 
potentiated in Rb+ external solution by 8-fold (–821.0 ± 265.5 pA). 
These high-responding cells in the pool showed rescue of Kir7 .1 
channel function and were most likely to have only W53X>WT 
correction with or without neutral bystander mutations. Some of 
the cells did not show any recovery of Kir7 .1 current (HR; –33.7 ± 
31.6 pA, Rb+; –80.5 ± 19.4 pA) and had a profile similar to that of 
iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells (11) . These low-responding cells (n  = 4 out 
of 13) likely experienced no base editing. A few cells (n  = 4 out of 13) 
showed slightly higher Rb+-stimulated current than the untreat -
ed iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells, but not as high as iPSC-RPEWT /WT  
cells. The medium-responding cells showed only a 3-fold Rb+ 
response (–238.7 ± 102.1 pA) for the current amplitude observed 
in the HR solution (–72.6 ± 29.7 pA). We hypothesize that medi-
um-responding cells contain a relatively low number of ion chan-
nels translated from a correctly base-edited KCNJ13 allele. The 
current-sweep plots of the representative cells under different 
treatment solutions are shown in Figure 4E.
Kcnj13W53X/+ monoallelic knockin mouse as an LCA16 model 
for validating genome editing. A notable limitation to translating 
our KCNJ13W53X gene-correction strategy to preclinical models is 
the lack of a mouse model harboring a homozygous pathogenic 
mutation in the gene. To test base-editing efficiency in vivo, we 
first sought to create mice carrying a W53X substitution in the 
Kcnj13 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. In the pronu-
clei of zygotes, a combination of Cas9 protein, 2 different specific 
guides to the Kcnj13 locus (GAATCCTAATGGACATGCGCTGG 
and TAATGGACATGCGCTGGCGCTGG), and single-stranded 
oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODN) was injected (Figure 5, A and 
B). Five of 6 newborn mice genotyped by sequencing had only 
1 allele with the nucleotide alteration. This result was further 
validated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 
to digest the PCR product with the NheI enzyme, which selec-
tively digests the mutant allele (Figure 5C ). We determined that 
the phenotype of homozygous mice (Figure 5D) generated from breeding heterozygous founders was lethal on postnatal day 
one. The retinal structure (optical coherence tomography [OCT] 
images, Figure 5E ) of these heterozygous mice was identical to 
that of age-matched WT mice. Electrical activity generated by 
the retina was recorded using ERG as a measure of retinal func-
tion in response to a light stimulus. Specific retinal cells gener-
ate varying waveforms, a, b, and c waves. The a wave, a negative 
deflection, corresponds to the photoreceptor. The b wave, which 
is positive, arises from the inner retinal cells, while the c wave 
is generated by the RPE cell. Full-field ERG evaluation of het -
erozygous mice was identical to that of WT mice (Supplemental 
Figure 8 , A–C), and c wave amplitudes measuring RPE cell func-
tion (W53X/+; 455.9 ± 18.7 vs. +/+; 504.5 ± 33.4 μV) were not 
statistically different (P  = 0.54) (Figure 5F).
We have determined that, unlike in humans, at least 1 nor-
mal mouse Kcnj13 gene allele is required for survival beyond 
postnatal day 1 (7 , 35) , precluding the establishment of a genetic  
model recapitulating the human recessive disease. Therefore, we 
used our Kcnj13W53X/+ mice to generate an LCA16 mouse model  
(Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R) using a Cas9 nuclease complex targeted to dis-
rupt the WT allele (Figure 5, E and F). The WT allele was edited 
in the RPE cells by delivering Cas9 mRNA and guide (Supple -
mental Table 9) through subretinal delivery of SNCs decorated 
with ATRA (SNC-PEG-ATRA), which explicitly targets RPE cells.

SNCs are summarized in Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemen-
tal Figure 9 . Mice were evaluated after 6 weeks to demonstrate 
intact retinal structure (Figure 6E ). ERG measurements of c wave 
amplitude before the injection were 515.5 ± 9.5 μ V, but 6 weeks 
after the disruption, it dropped to 234.2 ± 14.9 μ V (P  = 0.001). A 
decrease in c wave amplitude by 54% reflects the functional loss 
of RPE cells, as in LCA16. This disease model was used for the 
functional validation of base editing in vivo.
In vivo base editing via subretinal injection of ABE8e encap -
sulated SNCs. We designed sgRNAs targeting the W53X allele 
(Figure 6A ) of mouse Kcnj13. We validated it in the fibroblasts 
derived from Kcnj13W53X/+ mice via electroporation (Figure 6B ). To 
determine the editing efficiency in a heterozygous model system 
(mouse fibroblasts and in vivo), we delivered using SNC-PEG. We 
calculated the increase in the WT reads by converting the avail-
able W53X allele. We observed a 14.5% increase in the WT reads 
in the treated fibroblasts, suggesting 29% of cells received an edit 
(Supplemental Figure 10 ).
For in vivo subretinal delivery into Kcnj13W53X/+ mice, 
ABE8e mRNA, sgRNA, and GFP mRNA were packaged into 
SNC-PEG-ATRA. GFP-positive areas identified the injection 
site (Figure 6C), and genomic DNA from GFP-positive RPE 
tissue and the choroid optic cup were used for deep sequenc-
ing analysis of the Kcnj13 gene. We found that delivering 3 μ g 
ABE8e mRNA resulted in 16.8% ± 7 .9% RPE editing while deliv-
ering 2 μg resulted in 9.5% ± 5.0% RPE editing (n  = 4 eyes for 
each dose) (Figure 6D ). Our on-target analysis showed no oth-
er A>G substitutions outside or within the protospacer region. 
In addition, indel mutations were not significantly increased 
over those in placebo-treated mice (Figure 6E ). These data 
demonstrate the specific editing of the W53X allele in vivo by 
ABE8e-encapsulated SNC-PEG-ATRA.The Journal of Clinical Investigation    RESEARCH ARTICLE7 J Clin Invest. 2023;133(19):e171356  https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356
Base editing of the LCA16 mutant allele improves RPE function. 
In our Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R mice, we used ABE8e mRNA, sgRNA pack -
aged in SNC-PEG-ATRA, and administered subretinally to edit 
the mutant allele. Full-field ERG measurements were performed 
at weeks 2, 6, and 10 to monitor longitudinal rescue in phenotype 
(Figure 6F). At week 10, multifocal ERG (mfERG) was performed 
on injected eyes to determine whether functional recovery was 
regionalized based on localized delivery of the base-editor com-
plex. For the control group, Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R was injected with a base 
editor and a nontargeting guide.The nontargeted guide–injected mice exhibited a progres-
sive decrease in c wave amplitude as well as depressed mfERG 
waveforms in almost the entire retina. On the other hand, the 
base-edited eyes showed an increase in the c wave amplitude at 
all measured time points (Figure 6, G–J). mfERG showed local-
ized waveforms (Figure 6H and Supplemental Figure 11A ) that 
perhaps correlated with the site of injection (Figure 6C ). On the 
second week following the injection, the normalized c wave ampli-
tude (to that before the therapy) in eyes receiving the nontargeted 
guide was 0.8 ± 0.1, practically indistinguishable to that of the eyes

cells, which showed a low level of Rb+ response; and high-responding single cells, which showed Rb+ response like WT iPSC-RPE cells. The number (n) of 
cells binned into each class is shown at the top of each graph. (E) Current-sweep plot from a representative cell of each bin across a time course of being

bulge, where off-target editing is most likely to occur, was identified 
in the human genome for this sgRNA targeted to W53X.
We analyzed the off-target activity of ABE8e in base-edited 
HEKW53X/W53X, LCAW53X/W53X, and iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells at the 9 
potential sites (Supplemental Table 5 ). Deep-sequencing analysis 
of these sites showed that ABE8e treatment did not lead to signif -
icant off-target A>G editing or introduction of indels compared 
with that of untreated control cells except at 1 locus. In particular, 
this 1 off-target (Off_3: GRCh38:50530925 Intergenic) showed 4 
times more substitutions in base-edited HEKW53X/W53X cells. How -
ever, this nucleotide is already reported in humans to have a nat -
ural A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (rs139941105, minor 
allele frequency in 1000 Genomes = 0.01) of no known clinical 
importance (Supplemental Figure 13 , A and B). These data demon-
strate that the off-target modification levels of ABE8e at each of 
the 9 potential sites are much lower than its on-target editing effi-
ciency and overall indicate a favorable off-target–editing profile.
To detect in vivo off-target editing, we used genomic DNA 
(gDNA) isolated from the optic cup of base editor–treated het -
erozygous Kcnj13W53X/+ mice and screened the 11 top predicted 
off-target sites by rhAMP-Seq (Integrated DNA Technologies) 
(Supplemental Table 7). ABE8e treatment introduced on-target 
W53X>WT correction with an efficiency of 9.5% in these mice. 
Similarly to what occurred with our in vitro off-target analyses 
described above, we detected no substantial off-target editing 
following in vivo editing of mouse RPE (Supplemental Figure 13 , injected with the targeted guide, 0.9 ± 0.2 (P  = 0.9). At 10 weeks 
after injection, the c wave was reduced (0.7 ± 0.1) for the nontar-
geted retina compared with an increasing trend (1.6 ± 0.1, P = 0.01) 
(Figure 6K) for the targeted guide–delivered retina. This increase 
of 55% in amplitude and intact retinal structure, as evaluated 
by OCT (Figure 6, H and J), demonstrates that inherited retinal 
channelopathies could be mitigated using base editors. As a fur-
ther preclinical validation, we determined whether the SNC used 
to deliver the base editor triggers an immune response. The RPE 
cells in culture were transduced with either lentivirus, AAV7m8, 
or AAV5 or were incubated with SNC. Expression of inflammatory  
cytokines, including IFN-γ , IL-1α , IL-1β , IL-6, CD-8, and Iba1, 
was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). CD8 and Iba1 showed 
increased expression in virally transduced RPE cells, but not in cells 
exposed to SNCs (Supplemental Figure 11B ).
Off-target analysis of sgRNA for human and murine W53X targets 
confirms specificity . The Cas9 effector of the ABE dictates the speci-
ficity of the base editor to its target site and can bind off-target sites 
in the genome based on a similarity to the guide sequence. We used 
an online computational algorithm, Cas-OFFinder (36) , to identify 
the putative off-target sites for the human W53X sgRNA used above 
in our ABE8e treatments. We found 2,727 potential off-target sites, 
most harboring 4 mismatches with 1 nucleotide RNA bulge (n  = 
2,004) or DNA bulge (n  = 512), with other configurations and closer 
matches occurring much less frequently (Supplemental Figure 12).

with the ABE8e mRNA–loaded SNC-PEG, the nanoparticles will 
stay intact until internalized by the cells. Subsequent to uptake, 
intracellular GSH will facilitate nanoparticle disassembly and 
release the encapsulated ABE8e mRNA, enabling targeted base 
editing within the iPSC-RPE cells. We observed more than 50% 
on-target editing in patient-derived fibroblasts and 18% in iPSC-
RPE cells using the SNC-PEG delivery system. For in vivo editing 
of mouse RPE, we used the ligand-conjugated SNC-PEG-ATRA 
and observed 16% of RPE cells were edited. The editing of the 
RPE cells in vivo is confined, a result of targeted subretinal SNC 
delivery to localized cells around the injection site. We previous-
ly showed that the pathological state of RPE can be reversed by 
rescuing 25% of the Kir7 .1 channel function (11) . A recent trial 
from Editas (Edit101) introduced indels in the CEP290 gene 
linked to a different type of LCA, LCA10. It restored visual func-
tion in nonhuman primates with more than 10% functional pho -
toreceptors (39) . Each RPE sub serves multiple photoreceptors, 
so 10% RPE correction will rescue many of these photoreceptors. 
This potential multiplicative effect makes the RPE even more 
valuable as a target for genome editing. And as with many other 
ocular diseases, treating LCA16 should not require the correc-
tion of all mutant cells. Therefore, the base-editing efficiencies 
we gained in this study are well within the range of providing 
considerable therapeutic benefit.
Our study demonstrates an important nonviral delivery 
method for gene correction in vivo with transient exposure 
to editing reagents. The ABE activity is anticipated to be tran-
sient within cells and on the order of a few hours, considering 
the half-life of Cas9 mRNA (15 minutes to 3 hours) and the half-
life of the sgRNA (less than 3 hours) (40) . For our SNC delivered 
ABE8e to RPE, we have not specifically verified the half-life in 
our experimental setting, which might be different from what is 
previously reported. Based on prior studies with transient Cas9 
activity, we expect the off-target potential of our nanoparticle 
treatment to be lower than that of viral-based delivery strate -
gies (41) . SNC-mediated base editing can restore Kir7 .1 channel 
function, as assessed in our edited iPSC-RPE cells and in vivo 
Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R mouse studies. Previous studies have demonstrat -
ed the functional outcomes of base editing in RPE by correcting 
a point mutation in the RPE65 enzyme. Base editing restored its 
enzymatic substrates to support the visual cycle when rescued. 
Although ion channels such as Kir7 .1 catalyze transmembrane 
flux of ions, their functional restoration has a less established 
record of success (42) . On-target bystander substitutions and 
indels in some iPSC-RPE and in vivo mouse RPE cells are detect -
able. Still, they do not interfere with the potential functional ben-
efits of repairing the mutation in the tissue, as these genes are 
not expressed in the retina. Due to lacking a homozygous LCA16 
mouse model, we created an in vivo model by disrupting the WT 
allele of RPE cells using subretinal delivery of SNC carrying the 
targeted guide. Our study establishes that in vivo editing with 
nonviral delivery systems can restore the Kir7 .1 channel function 
in RPE. The edited Kcnj13W53X/+Δ R mice displayed recovery of their 
ERG c wave amplitudes from the edited RPE and had no further 
retinal degeneration. Additional preclinical validation would 
require determining safety and efficacy using an acceptable ani-
mal model for regulatory clearance.C and D). Together, these results suggest that ABE8e could be an 
effective and specific method to correct polymorphisms in the 
genome and that SNCs can serve as effective vehicles to correct 
mutations in the RPE.
Discussion
Currently, recessive loss-of-function KCNJ13 point mutations 
are the only known genetic cause of LCA16, disrupting the Kir7 .1 
channel function and altering RPE physiology, leading to ret -
inal degeneration with progressive vision loss in patients. In the 
absence of disease-modifying approved therapies, correction of 
gene mutations in the RPE cells could result in the avoidance of 
treatment-related serious adverse events (no off-target respons-
es), restore the Kir7 .1 channel function (in vitro and in vivo elec-
trophysiology outcomes), improve vision, or prevent further 
disease progression (ERG and OCT). Of the 12 different known 
LCA16-causing KCNJ13 gene mutations (37) , 8 are theoretically 
accessible by base editors and 5 of those by ABE (requiring A>G 
[or T>C] edits). Here, we provide essential proof of concept that 
delivery of ABE8e to RPE via subretinal injection of SNCs can 
result in correction of the W53X pathogenic allele and restoration 
of Kir7 .1 channel function in RPE cells.
The SNC is a powerful nonviral delivery system for protein 
and nucleic acids (33) . Our group has previously reported SNC-
PEG–mediated transfection (50% for plasmid and 60% for 
mRNA), delivery, and GSH-responsive release characteristics 
(33, 38). The mRNA transfection efficiency remained unaffected 
at GSH concentrations lower than 0.5 × 10−3 M, suggesting extra -
cellular stability of SNC-PEG (considering plasma/extracellular 
GSH concentration ranges from 10−6 M to 2× 10−5 M). However, 
at GSH concentrations of 0.5 × 10−3 M or higher (corresponding 
to cytosol GSH concentrations between 10−3 M and 10−2 M), a 
remarkable decrease in the mRNA transfection efficiency was 
observed, indicating SNC-PEG can effectively break down in 
the cytosol to release the payload readily. After treating the cells Figure 6. Phenotypic reversal of RPEW53X mice following in vivo ABE8e

sequencing are listed in Supplemental Table 2 .
Patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE cell culture and mainte -
nance . Fibroblasts derived from a skin biopsy of an LCA16 patient 
( 7,  1 1 )  with homozygous W53X mutation in KCNJ13 were cultured 
and maintained in complete DMEM high-glucose medium con-
taining 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep at 37°C with 5% CO2. iPSCs, 
reprogrammed from patient-derived fibroblasts, were cultured 
on Matrigel and differentiated to iPSC-RPE using an approach 
similar to that previously described (11, 44) . Briefly, on day 0 
(D0) of differentiation, iPSCs were lifted using ReLeSR (Stem 
Cell Technologies; catalog 05872) to generate embryoid bod-
ies (EBs). The EBs were maintained overnight in mTeSR+ con -
taining 10 μ M ROCK inhibitor (R&D Systems; catalog Y-27632). 
Then, over the next 3 days, the EBs were gradually transitioned to 
neural induction medium (NIM) (DMEM: F12 1:1, 1% N2 supple -
ment, 1× MEM nonessential amino acids [MEM NEAA], 1× Glu-
taMAX, and 2 μ g/mL heparin; MilliporeSigma). On D7 , EBs were 
plated on Nunc 6-well plates coated with laminin (Thermo Fisher  
Scientific; catalog 23017015; diluted 1:20 in DMEM/F12). On D16, 
neurospheres were mechanically lifted. The remaining adherent 
cells were transitioned to retinal differentiation medium (RDM) 
(DMEM/F12 [3:1], 2% B27 without retinoic acid, 1% antibiotic-  
antimycotic solution) and allowed to differentiate to RPE. RDM 
was supplemented with 10 μ M SU5402 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog 
SML0443-5MG) and 3 μ M CHIR99021 (BioGems, catalog 2520691) 
for the first 4 medium changes. After more than 60 days of differen-
tiation, iPSC-RPE cells were purified as described by Sharma et al. 
and cultured on the desired surface (45) . Briefly, cultures with dif -
ferentiated patches of iPSC-RPE were dissociated using 1X TrypLE 
Select Enzyme (Thermo Fisher, catalog 12563011) and enriched for 
iPSC-RPE via magnetically activated cell sorting using anti-CD24 
and anti-CD56 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec). iPSC-RPE cells in the 
negative cell fraction were seeded on the desired surface precoated 
with laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 23017015; diluted 
1:20 in DMEM/F12) and cultured.
SNCs for adenine base editing and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We 
recently reported a safe and efficient nanoplatform, SNC, for deliv-
ering CRISPR gene-editing and base-editing components (33) . SNCs 
were synthesized using a water-in-oil microemulsion method. The 
oil phase (1 mL) was prepared by mixing Triton X-100 (885 μ L) with 
hexanol (0.9 mL) and cyclohexane (3.75 mL). An aliquot of aqueous 
solution (25 μ L) containing the desired payload (ssODN or base editor 
mRNA+sgRNA, with a total nucleic acid concentration of 2 mg/mL)  
was mixed with the silica reagents: tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) 
(4 μL), bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)-disulfide (BTPD) (6 μ L), and 
N-(3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (TESPIC, 1 
mg). The synthesis of TESPIC was reported previously (33) . This mix -
ture was homogenized by pipetting and then added to the oil phase (1 
mL). The water-in-oil microemulsion was formed by vortexing for 1 
minute. Under vigorous stirring (1,500 rpm), an aliquot of 30% aqueous 
ammonia solution (4 μ L) was added, and the water-in-oil microemul-
sion was stirred at 4°C for 12 hours to obtain unmodified SNCs. Ace -
tone (1.5 mL) was added to the microemulsion to precipitate the SNCs. 
The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation (15,000g ) and washed 
twice with ethanol and 3 times with ultrapure water. The purified  A limitation of our study is that we do not yet know the clonal 
editing outcomes of cells edited in vitro or in vivo. The combina -
tion of alleles in a single cell is a critical parameter for the function 
of the tetrameric Kir7 .1 channel. Correction of just a single allele, 
while having detrimental edits in fellow alleles, will likely not 
preserve RPE health to an extent similar to that of a biallelic cor-
rection or monoallelic correction without alteration in the second 
allele. A clonal analysis would reveal the precise editing outcomes 
per cell. It could distinguish the phenotypic impact of edited gen-
otypes (43) . However, RPE cells from iPSC-RPE and mouse eyes 
are postmitotic, making clonal amplification of edited cells exper-
imentally intractable in these systems.
In conclusion, while addressing several applicable challenges 
in correcting an LCA16-causing pathogenic mutation in the Kir7 .1 
channel, our study provides proof-of-concept therapy for a rare 
disease. Importantly, base editing of the KCNJ13W53X allele in vitro 
and in vivo showed specificity for the W53X mutation without 
generating detrimental on-target bystander substitutions, indels, 
or off-target edits elsewhere in the genome. K+ conductance 
in iPSC-RPE in vitro and c wave recovery in Kcnj13W53X/– in vivo 
confirmed the functional rescue of the Kir7 .1 channel following 
base editing. The specific delivery of base editor tools to RPE via 
the nonviral SNC platform provides a powerful emerging tool for 
tissue-specific delivery of mRNA or protein-based gene editing 
therapeutics with good biocompatibility, the ability to package 
large cargo, increased safety profile, and streamlined manufac-
turing. These advances will likely direct future preclinical and 
clinical applications of base editing for correcting mutations 
causing LCA16 and other ocular genetic diseases.
Methods
HEK Flp-In 293 stable cells with GFP-tagged WT and W53X Kir7 .1 expres-
sion . HEK Flp-In 293 host cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R75007) 
were generated using a pFRT /lacZeo target site vector to express GFP-
tagged Kir7 .1 (WT and W53X). These cells contain a single Flp recom-
bination target (FRT) site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus to 
allow stable integration of the GFP-tagged human KCNJ13 sequence 
(WT and W53X). As these cells express the zeocin gene under the 
SV40 early promoter, complete DMEM high-glucose medium (10% 
FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin [Pen-Strep], 2 mM l -glutamine) con-
taining 100 μg/mL zeocin was used for maintenance. The GFP-WT or 
GFP-W53X hKCNJ13 gene sequence was integrated into the genome 
of these cells based on the manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly, the cells 
were cotransfected with FLP-In expression vector (pcDNA5/FRT) 
containing the GFP-tagged hKCNJ13 sequence (WT or W53X) creat -
ed by in-fusion cloning and pOG44 recombinase expression plasmid. 
The pOG44 plasmid with constitutive expression of the Flp recom-
binase under the CMV promoter mediates the homologous recombi-
nation between the FRT sites of host cells and the expression vector 
such that the construct from the vector is inserted into the genome at 
the FRT site. This insertion brings the hygromycin B resistance gene 
into the frame, inactivates the zeocin fusion gene, and expresses the 
gene of interest under the CMV promoter. Forty-eight hours after 
cotransfection, the cells were passaged at 25% confluency to select 
stable transfectants in 200 μg/mL of hygromycin B. The hygromy-
cin B–resistant cell clones (n = 15–20) were picked, maintained in 100  
μg/mL hygromycin B, and further expanded for their characterization The Journal of Clinical Investigation    RESEARCH ARTICLEJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(19):e171356  https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 12
target vector plasmid contains a copy of the LCA guide, Cas9 protein, 
and mCherry reporter transgene driven by the EF-1α promoter. Cell 
culture supernatant was collected from HEK293 after transfection and 
was concentrated at 1,500g for 45 minutes. The concentrated lentivi-
rus titer was between 107 and 1010 particles/mL, estimated via func-
tional testing in HEK293 cells.
Gene editing in iPSC-RPE using lentiviral transduction to deliver Cas9, 
sgRNA, and SNC to deliver ssODN. For our attempt to edit the KCNJ13 
gene carrying a W53X nonsense mutation, we used viral transduction 
to deliver Cas9 and a sgRNA (TAATGGACATGCGCTAGCGT) to the 
mature iPSC-RPE cells. We used lentiviral vectors (100 MOI) designed 
explicitly for this purpose: lentiCRISPR v2-mCherry (Addgene plasmid 
99154), a gift from Agata Smogorzewska, with the annealed sgRNA 
oligonucleotides cloned into it using the BsmB1 enzyme digestion and 
ligation. Successful integration of the sgRNA sequence was confirmed 
by DNA sequencing with the primer 5′-GGACTATCATATGCTTAC -
CG-3′ for the U6 promoter, which also drives sgRNA expression. Lenti-
virus was generated in-house using the method described above. This 
lentivirus was used to transduce mature iPSC-RPE cells to express 
Cas9, sgRNA, and the reporter gene mCherry, allowing easy identifi-
cation of transduced cells. After 6 hours of viral transduction, 3 μ g of 
the HDR repair template for W53X gene correction, ssODN-ATTO488 
(GATGCTTGGGG GATCCTAATGGA TATGCGCT GGCGTTGGAT -
GATGTTA GTCTTTTCTGCTTCT; bold letters show the wobble 
changes), was delivered to the cells using SNC and incubated for 48 
hours. Papain digestion was used to dissociate cells that expressed both 
red and green fluorescent markers, indicating that they had received 
both Cas9+sgRNA and ssODN constructs, into a single cell that was 
then used for patch-clamp experiments.
Base editing in Kir7 .1-HEK293 stable cells by electroporation. 
HEK293 stable cells expressing KCNJ13W53X-GFP were subcultured 
24 hours before nucleofection at 70% confluency. The ABE8e 
mRNA (spCas9-NG, 3 μ g) (49)  and sgRNA (100 pmol) or RNP com-
plex formed by incubating the mixture of ABE8e protein (3 μ g) and 
sgRNA (100 pmol) at room temperature for 10 minutes was intro -
duced via electroporation; 1 × 105 cells were electroporated using 
the FS-100 program in the Lonza 4D nucleofector according to the 
manufacturer’s guidelines. After electroporation, cells were seeded 
in a 6-well plate and maintained in complete DMEM medium con-
taining 100 μ g/mL hygromycin B for further analysis.
Base editing in LCA16-patient’s specific fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE by 
SNCs. The W53X-LCA16-patient’s specific fibroblasts (FibroW53X) were 
subcultured 1 day before treatment. For base editing, ABE8e mRNA (3 
μg) and sgRNA (100 pmol) were delivered to fibroblasts using SNCs. 
Five days after treatment, DNA was isolated for genomic analysis. For 
base editing in iPSC-RPE, the cells were first seeded in a 96-well plate 
at a density of 50,000 cells per well in RDM containing 10% FBS and 
10 μM ROCK inhibitor (R&D Systems; catalog Y-27632). On D2, the 
media was switched to RDM containing 2% FBS. On D3 after seed-
ing, ABE8e mRNA (3 μg) and sgRNA (100 pmol) were delivered to the 
cells using SNCs in RDM. the iPSC-RPE monolayer was dissociated 
2 days after treatment with SNC-ABE8e. Cells were seeded on Tran-
swell inserts and also collected for gDNA analysis. iPSC-RPE cells 
transitioned to Transwell inserts and were cultured for 4 to 6 weeks 
to obtain a polarized monolayer of RPE and subsequently analyzed 
for Kir7 .1 channel function by the whole-cell patch-clamp approach. 
Untreated cells were used as references.SNCs were collected by centrifugation (15,000g ). The as-prepared, 
unmodified SNC was redispersed in ultrapure water (1 mL). For surface 
modification, methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (mPEG-silane) 
or a mixture of mPEG-silane and amine-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane 
(NH2-PEG-silane, Mn = 5000) (molar ratio of mPEG-silane: NH2-
PEG-silane = 8:2) was added to the SNC suspension mentioned above 
for the synthesis of SNC-PEG without ATRA (i.e., SNC-PEG) or SNC-
PEG-NH2 (for ATRA conjugation), respectively. The total amount of 
PEG was 10 wt% of SNC. The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 
8.0 using a 30% aqueous ammonia solution. The mixture was stirred 
at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting SNCs were purified 
by washing with ultrapure water 3 times and concentrated with Ami-
con Ultra Centrifugal Filters (MilliporeSigma). ATRA was conjugated 
onto SNC-PEG-NH2 via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiim-
ide (EDC)/N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) catalyzed amidation. Pay-
load-encapsulated SNC-PEG-NH2 (0.5 mg) was redispersed in 1 mL 
DI water. EDC (7 .5 μ g), NHS (4.5 μ g), and a DMSO solution of ATRA 
(6 μg in 5 μ L DMSO) were added to the above solution. The solution 
was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours, and then the resulting 
ATRA-conjugated SNC (i.e., SNC-PEG-ATRA) was washed with water 
3 times. The SNC-PEG-ATRA was concentrated with Amicon Ultra 
Centrifugal Filters to a payload concentration of 2 mg/mL before use. 
Materials used were as follows: TEOS, Triton X-100, acetone, etha -
nol, EDC, NHS, and ammonia (30% water) (purchased from Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). Hexanol and cyclohexane were purchased from the 
Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. DMSO was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 
BTPD was purchased from Gelest Inc. mPEG-silane (Mn = 5000) and 
amine-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (NH2-PEG-silane, Mn = 5000) 
were purchased from Biochempeg Scientific Inc. ATRA was purchased 
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.
Base-editor mRNAs . Using their mammalian-optimized UTR 
sequences, base-editor mRNAs were obtained as a custom product 
from Trilink Biotechnologies. The mRNAs were synthesized with com-
plete substitution of uracil by N1-methylpseudouridine and cotran-
scriptional 5′ capping with the CleanCap AG analog resulting in a 5′ 
Cap1 structure and included a 120 nucleotide polyA tail.
sgRNA design. The sgRNAs targeting the W53X location in the 
human KCNJ13 gene were designed using Benchling (https:/ /www.
benchling.com). The design was validated with 2 other online tools, 
CRISPR-RGEN (46)  and PnB Designer (47) , to confirm its on-target 
specificity (Supplemental Table 8 ). Only 1 sgRNA (Figure 1C ) appeared 
to be very specific for the W53X location, as it would allow the bind-
ing of the spCas9 domain to the target locus that positions c.158G>A 
site within the editing window of ABE (4–8 for ABE8e, counting the 
PAM as 21–23). This sgRNA also had the highest on-target score (65.7) 
and lowest off-target score (56.8) among the Benchling-designed 
sgRNAs. The sgRNA targeting mouse Kcnj13 was also selected based 
on the above criteria (highest on-target score, 57 .1; lowest off-target 
score, 56.8). The chemically modified forms of these sgRNAs (human, 
G*C*G*CUAGCGUUGGAUGAUGU; mouse, G*C*G*CUAGCGCUG -
GAUGAUGC) were ordered from Synthego.
Generation of the lentiviral vector for Cas9-mediated gene editing . 
Lentivirus was manufactured for Cas9-mediated editing as described 
in Gándara, Carolina, et al. (48). Briefly, the HEK293 cells were plated 
and ready for transfection 24 hours after plating. The cells were trans-
fected with the target plasmid when they reached 70% confluence, 
along with the packaging gene plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2. The The Journal of Clinical Investigation    RESEARCH ARTICLE13 J Clin Invest. 2023;133(19):e171356  https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356
On-target analysis by deep sequencing. Treated and untreated 
cells were dissociated using enzymatic treatment (Accutase/Papain) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for genomic analysis. 
From the HEK293 stable cells, total RNA (QIAGEN, 74134) was iso -
lated, reverse transcribed to cDNA (Thermo Fisher, 4368814), and 
subsequently amplified for on-target analysis using KCNJ13 Illumina-  
specific primers (Supplemental Table 3 ). From fibroblasts, iPSC-
RPE, and mouse optic cups, gDNA was isolated according to the 
manufacturer’s guidelines (Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit, D4069) 
and quantified using Nanodrop 2000 or Qubit (Thermo Fisher). For 
deep sequencing of the KCNJ13 locus, gDNA was amplified using 
Illumina-specific primers with adapter sequences (amplicon size, 
–150 bp) (Supplemental Table 4 ). Unique indexes (i7 and i5) were 
ligated to each custom amplicon by PCR (amplicon size, 250 bp), 
and the indexed amplicons were pooled and purified using AMPure 
XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). The indexed library was run 
on an Illumina MiniSeq instrument with a read length of 150 bp. 
Deep-sequencing data were analyzed using RGEN Cas-analyzer (51) 
and CRISPResso2 (52) software.
Off-target analysis by deep sequencing. The potential off-target  
sites for the hW53X-sgRNA were identified by an in silico tool, 
Cas-OFFinder (36) . The parameters used were an NG/NGG/NAG 
PAM with up to 4 mismatches to the sgRNA sequence (Supplemental 
Table 5 and Supplemental Figure 12). We also considered a DNA and 
RNA bulge of 1 nucleotide, which occurs due to an extra unpaired base 
in the DNA sequence concerning sgRNA or an extra unpaired base 
in sgRNA for DNA sequence in the genome, respectively. From the 
treated and untreated stable cells, fibroblasts, and iPSC-RPE, gDNA 
was isolated and amplified using primers specific to off-target sites. 
All the primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 6 . Deep-  
sequencing and data analysis were performed as described above.
rhAmp off-target analysis in W53X mice. As the gDNA yield from 
the mouse optic cup was too low to amplify all the off-target sites 
separately, we used a highly efficient RNase H2-dependent (rhAmp) 
PCR technique that can amplify different targets using a single PCR 
reaction. Amplification and sequencing were performed according to 
IDT rhAmp instructions. The rhAmpSeq CRISPR panel was designed 
using the IDT designing tool (https:/ /www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/
rhampseq-design-tool) for the potential off-targets of mW53X-sgRNA 
identified using Cas-OFFinder (Supplemental Table 7). The amplicon 
library was prepared using the rhAmpSeq CRISPR Library Kit (IDT, 
10007317) and rhAmpSeq i5 and i7 index primers. The purified library 
was sequenced on the MiniSeq instrument from Illumina. Sequencing 
analysis was performed using the IDT rhAMP CRISPR analysis tool 
(https:/ /www.idtdna.com/site/ analysislab).
Immunocytochemistry . Kir7 .1 protein expression was assessed in 
the pool of W53X-mutant, WT, and base-edited HEK293 stable cells 
by immunocytochemistry as described earlier (10) . As the protein is 
GFP tagged, GFP mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Cell Signaling, 
2955, 1:250) was used to enhance the Kir7 .1 protein expression for its 
detection in the cells. Sodium potassium ATPase rabbit monoclonal 
primary antibody (Thermo Fisher, ST0533, 1:500) was used to label the 
cell membranes. Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Pro -
teintech, SA00006.8, 1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey 
anti-mouse (Proteintech, SA00006.5, 1:500) secondary antibodies 
were used. DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Immunostained 
cells were imaged on a confocal microscope (Nikon C2 Instruments).Generating the Kcnj13W53X/+ knockin mouse model. The Kcnj13W53X 
mouse model was generated by Cyagen Biosciences using CRISPR/
Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Exon 2 was selected as the tar-
get site for the intended base change knockin using 2 distinct guides 
and a donor sequence. For HDR, the donor oligo carried the muta -
tion p.W53* (TGG to TAG) flanked by 120 bp homologous sequenc-
es combined on both sides. Microinjections of Cas9 protein, sgRNA 
mixture, and ssODN were made into the pronucleus of fertilized 
eggs. The embryos were then transplanted to the pseudopregnant 
mice, and the resulting progeny were genotyped using PCR and 
RFLP to validate the desired gene mutation.
OCT . OCT was performed on mice anesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine and whose pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide using 
the Spectralis HRA+OCT system (Heidelberg Engineering Inc.). 
The mice were placed on a heating pad that was maintained at 37°C 
throughout the procedure, and a drop of artificial tear was applied 
before placing the corneal lens to keep the eyes from drying out. The 
images were captured and analyzed with Heidelberg Eye Explorer 
software (version 1.10.0.0).
ERG in mice . ERG was performed in mice using a standard protocol 
described elsewhere before and after the base editing to evaluate the 
function of the retina. Briefly, the mice were dark adapted overnight pri-
or to ERG. ERG signals were captured in full darkness using an Espion 
Ganzfeld full-field system (Diagnosys LLC). When using a contact elec-
trode, a drop of 2% hypromellose solution was applied to the eye in order 
to keep the cornea wet and make electrical contact. Mice were subjected 
to mfERG testing with the Celeris system (Diagnosys LLC), in which the 
retina is divided into 19 hexagonal areas and stimulated by a pseudo -
random sequence of black and white hexagons that alternate multiple 
times per second. Data acquired were analyzed with Espion software 
(Diagnosys LLC; version V6.0.54) and Origin 2018b (OriginLab Corp.). 
For a and b waves, the eyes were exposed to a series of flash intensities 
(0.03 to 30 cd.s/m2) using a ganzfeld dome for 400 ms with a 2-second 
interval between flashes. For c waves, the eyes were exposed to 25 cd.s/
m2 for 4 seconds. Animals were subjected to ERG every 2 weeks.
Base editing in mice . C57BL/6J male and female mice (Kcn -
j13W53X/+) were housed at the animal facility at University of Wisconsin–  
Madison under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle at a controlled tem-
perature (25 ± 5°C) and humidity (40%–50%). The mice were genotyped 
using standard PCR methods with the primers listed in Supplemen-
tal Table 3 , followed by digestion with restriction enzyme NheI (Anza 
IVGN0066, Thermo Fisher). The W53X mutation creates a restriction 
site for NheI, and therefore the W53X allele resulted in 2 (212 bp and 
302 bp) fragments compared with only 1 (514 bp) fragment in the WT 
allele ( Supplemental Figure 14 ). W53X-targeting sgRNA was designed 
and validated in mouse fibroblasts (50)  isolated from Kcnj13W53X/+ mice. 
A subretinal injection (2 μ L) of SNC-PEG-ATRA encapsulating ABE8e 
mRNA (2 and 3 μ g), W53X-targeting sgRNA (Supplemental Table 9) 
(100 pmol), and GFP mRNA (1 μ g, to visualize the site of injection) was 
performed in mice (n  = 4 eyes). PBS or empty SNC-PEG-ATRA (n  = 4) 
injected eyes were used as references. Five days after injection, imag -
ing was carried out to assess the delivery based on GFP reporter mRNA. 
gDNA was isolated from the optic cup of these mice to determine the 
on-target and off-target effects of base editing. To determine the editing 
efficiency in this monogenic W53X mouse model at the cellular level, 
any increase in the WT reads after base editing of the W53X allele was 
noted and doubled to get the number of cells edited.The Journal of Clinical Investigation    RESEARCH ARTICLEJ Clin Invest. 2023;133(19):e171356  https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 14

shaoqingong@wisc.edu.Electrophysiology assay . A high-throughput automated patch 
clamp (Q Patch II, Sophion) was used to measure the whole-cell 
current from the HEKWT, HEKW53X, and base-edited HEKW53X stable 
cells as described earlier (53) . Briefly, the cells were grown in a T75 
flask for 48 to 72 hours and then detached gently using Detachin. 
The cells were centrifuged at 90g  for 1 minute and resuspended 
in serum-free medium containing 25 mM HEPES. The cells (3 M/
mL) were kept on a shaker for 20 minutes before the experiment. 
Forty-eight cells were recorded in parallel on single-hole dispos-
able Qplates with individual amplifiers. A pressure protocol was 
used to achieve cell positioning (–70 mbar), Giga seal (–75 mbar), 
and whole-cell configuration (5 pulses with –50 mbar increment 
between the pulses, first pulse of –250 mbar). The current was 
recorded in response to voltage-clamp steps from the holding 
potential (–10 mV) to voltages between –140 mV and +40 mV (Δ  = 
10 mV). More than 70% of the cells completed the experiment or 
run. The cells in which the stability was compromised during the 
experiment were judged by the leak current and excluded from the 
analysis. The extracellular solution contained the following: 135 
mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 
and 1 mM MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7 .4 and osmolarity 305 mOsm. 
The intracellular solution contained the following: 30 mM KCl, 83 
mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 4 
mM Mg-ATP, and 0.1 mM GTP, pH adjusted to 7 .2 and osmolarity 
280 mOsm. In an alternative external solution, NaCl was replaced 
with RbCl (140 mM) and used as an enhancer of Kir7 .1 current. An 
extracellular solution with 20 mM Cs+ was used to block the Kir7 .1 
current. The data were analyzed using Sophion Analyzer, version 
6.6.44. Whole-cell manual patch-clamp recording of base-edited 
hiPS-RPE cells was performed according to the standard protocol 
described elsewhere (7). There was no reporter or selection marker 
to aid in identifying the recipient or edited cells. Therefore, these 
cells were picked up randomly for the electrophysiology assay.
Statistics . The data analysis was done using Origin software 
(Origin 2020, OriginLab Corp.) and expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-
tailed, unpaired Student’s t  test was used to determine statistical 
differences. One-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparison, 
followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) method 
for adjustment of multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
Study approval. All work with LCA16 patient-derived cells (fibro -
blasts, iPSCs, and iPSC-RPE) was carried out following institutional, 
national, and international guidelines and approved by the Universi-
ty of Wisconsin–Madison’s Institutional Review Board and Stem Cell 
Research Oversight Committee. The animal protocols followed the 
ARVO Statement for use in ophthalmic and vision science research 
and were approved by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine 
and Public Health Animal Care and Use Committee.
