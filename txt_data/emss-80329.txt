Abstract
The retina is an immune privileged tissue, which is protected from external and internal insults by 
its blood-retinal barriers and immune suppressive microenvironment. Apart from the avoidance 
and tolerance strategies, the retina is also protected by its own defense system, i.e., microglia and 
the complement system. The immune privilege and defense mechanisms work together to maintain 
retinal homeostasis. During aging, the retina is at an increased risk of developing various 
degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and 
glaucomatous retinopathy. Previously, we have shown that aging induces a para-inflammatory 
response in the retina. In this review, we explore the impact of aging on retinal immune regulation 
and the connection between homeostatic control of retinal immune privilege and para-
inflammation under aging conditions and present a view that may explain why aging puts the 
retina at risk of developing degenerative diseases.

1 Introduction
Avoidance , tolerance  and resistance  are strategies utilized by the host to protect it from 
external and internal insults. Avoidance reduces the risk of exposure to danger (or 
pathogens). Resistance reduces damage caused by pathogens, and tolerance reduces the 
negative impact of the pathogen on host fitness without directly affecting the pathogen 
burden ( Medzhitov et al., 2012 ). Resistance is active defense, whereas avoidance and 
tolerance can be viewed as passive defense (although, immunological tolerance to specific 
antigens is often achieved through an active mechanism). Homeostasis and functionality are 
maintained at the tissue level also by these defense strategies. The retina, for example, 
avoids pathogens and systemic inflammatory disturbance by insulating itself from the rest

strategy is to utilize specialized mechanisms to suppress inflammation and subsequent 
immunopathology. Avoidance and tolerance together warrant the immune privilege status of 
the retina. The resistance mechanism is operational when pathogens breach the BRBs, or 
when danger molecules arise within the retina. Subsequently, pathogenic burden is reduced, 
and danger molecules are eliminated so homeostasis can be maintained. Resistance is 
attained by retinal microglia and the complement system when threats are mild and transient 
(para-inflammation) ( Xu et al., 2009 ). Infiltrating immune cells further support the retina 
when threat is over the threshold ( Chen and Xu, 2015 ).
The average lifespan of human beings has increased dramatically with the improvement of 
our health care and modernization of our society. Prevalence of age-related diseases, 
including age-related visual loss has radically increased. Aging is believed to be an 
important risk factor in the development of degenerative and angiogenic diseases, such as 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucomatous 
retinopathy, although, the etiology is yet to be elucidated ( Ardeljan and Chan, 2013 , Luu and 
Palczewski, 2018 ). All the age-related retinal diseases have two features in common, the 
disruption of retinal homeostasis and low-grade chronic inflammation (para-inflammation). 
Previously, we discussed retinal para-inflammation in the aging eye ( Xu et al., 2009 ), which 
represents the resistance strategy of the neuroretina against age-mediated endogenous 
insults. In this article we discuss retinal immune regulation under aging conditions, with a 
particular focus on retinal avoidance and tolerance strategies, and explore how aging puts the 
retina at risk of developing various degenerative diseases.
2 Retinal immune privilege
A fine structure of retinal neurons is essential for visual function. This structural requirement 
for function makes the retina extremely vulnerable to internal and external insults. In 
addition, the retina has a poor renewal and repair capacity, alongside a low functional 
autonomy. As a result, the consequences of even minor damage to the retina can be 
devastating. Nature has developed specialized avoidance and tolerance strategies to 
minimize and prevent retinal disturbance, e.g., retinal immune privilege ( Forrester and Xu, 
2012 , Gregerson, 1998 , Streilein et al., 2002 ). Retinal cells (such as neurons) are privileged 
from systemic immune surveillance. Intraocular compartments, such as the anterior 
chamber, vitreous cavity and the subretinal space, are immune privileged sites. When foreign 
antigens are exposed to these compartments they induce tolerance instead of immune 
rejection ( Ferguson and Griffith, 1997 , Streilein, 1995 ). The mechanism that maintains 
retinal immune privilege can be viewed as layered protections ( Caspi, 2006 ). BRBs provide 
the first layer of protection to the retina. Once the barrier is breached, retinal cells operate 
the second layer of protection by suppressing the local inflammatory response to reduce 
immunopathology. In conjunction, the antigenic signals from pathogens in the intraocular 
compartments are sent to the systemic immune system, and an antigen-specific tolerance or 
a suppressive immune response is induced, which offers the third layer of protection.Chen et al. Page 2

The retinal-immune barrier consists of three components. (1) Inner blood-retina barrier 
(iBRB); formed by tight junctions between retinal vascular endothelial cells. (2) Outer 
blood-retinal barrier (oBRB); formed by tight junctions between retinal pigment epithelial 
(RPE) cells. (3) Blood-aqueous barrier; formed by tight junctions in the non-pigmented 
epithelial layer of the ciliary body and the endothelium of the iris vasculature. These barriers 
insulate the retina from exogenous pathogens, segregate the tissue from the systemic 
immune system and avoid immune surveillance. A functional iBRB is maintained by the 
neurovascular unit (NVU) ( Metea and Newman, 2007 ), which consists of vascular 
endothelial cells, pericytes, glial cells, and neurons ( Muoio et al., 2014 ).
2.2 Retinal immune suppression
When pathogens break through the BRBs, the second layer of protection is triggered. The 
retina employs a strategy to reduce the immune response which minimizes 
immunopathology. This includes the induction of retinal cell tolerance to invading pathogens 
and suppression of immune cell activation. For example, opportunistic pathogens can persist 
as latent infections (although they can be reactivated, particularly in immunocompromised 
individuals). Retinal immune suppression is achieved by various neuro-immune regulatory 
proteins. These proteins control microglial or macrophage activation (e.g., via the CX3CL1, 
CD200, CD47, and endocannabinoids pathways), T cell activation (e.g., via 
thrombospondin-1, TGF- β, CTLA4, CTLA2, etc.) ( Horie et al., 2010 , Kawazoe et al., 2012 , 
Mochizuki et al., 2013 , Sugita et al., 2008 , Sugita et al., 2009 , Zamiri et al., 2005 ), or 
complement activation (via expression of various complement regulators such as CFH, 
CD46, CD55, CD59, etc.), and induction of immune cell death (e.g., via the Fas ligand 
(FasL) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)) ( Ferguson 
and Griffith, 1997 , Ferguson and Griffith, 2007 , Kazama et al., 2008 ). Mechanisms related 
to regulation of effector cells (i.e., immune cells and RPE cells) have been the main focus 
when researching the second layer of protection. Whether or not the retina can also control 
pathogens, for example, by restricting or reducing their toxic effects remains unknown.
2.3 Intraocular antigen-induced systemic regulation
When antigens are inoculated into the anterior chamber, vitreous cavity or subretinal space, 
they can induce antigen-specific systemic immune suppression. Ocular F4/80+ macrophages 
and intraocular levels of TGF β2 are crucial for the generation of antigen-specific, immune 
suppressive T or B cells ( Egan et al., 1996 , Streilein, 1999 ). Anterior chamber-induced 
immune deviation (ACAID) ( Streilein, 1995 ), vitreous cavity-induced immune deviation 
(VCAID) and subretinal space-induced immune deviation ( Jiang et al., 1993 , Wenkel et al., 
1999 ) are examples of the third layer of protection. This is important when the first and 
second layers of protection fail, and antigens enter the intraocular compartment, for 
example, in ocular injury. A controlled immune response to the invading antigen will 
minimize immunopathology and may offer protection to foreign materials or proteins 
inoculated into the eye through intraocular drug deliver or by gene therapy.
Although multiple types of cells are involved in the layered protection of the neuronal retina 
(Caspi, 2006 ), this review discusses predominately the role of microglia and the complement Chen et al. Page 3

astrocytes and endothelial cells is rather limited.
3 The impact of age on retinal immune privilege
3.1 Age-related changes in retinal barriers
A functional iBRB is maintained by the NVU ( Metea and Newman, 2007 ). Senescence of 
NVU-related cells may affect the integrity and function of the iBRB. An age-related 
reduction in the number of astrocytes has been observed in the rat retina ( Mansour et al., 
2008 ). Müller cells from aging eyes contain a great abundance of oxidized lipid (4-
hydroxy-2-nonenal) ( Nag et al., 2011 ). Endothelial loss and cellular senescence of neurons 
have been reported in the aging human retina ( Lopez-Luppo et al., 2017 ). Importantly, a 
progressive structural and functional deterioration of the NVU has been observed in the 
aging rat retina. This is characterized by thickening of the basement membrane, altered 
length and orientation of desmin filaments of pericytes, widespread alpha-smooth muscle 
actin (α-SMA) distribution ( Hughes et al., 2006 ), followed by capillary loss, aneurysms, and 
distorted, leaky vessels ( Chan-Ling et al., 2007 , Hughes et al., 2006 ). Despite the structural 
and functional deterioration of the iBRB, T or B cells were not detected in the normal aging 
retina (Figure 1). Aged retinas present with mild microglial activation and complement 
activation ( Chen et al., 2010 , Xu et al., 2009 ), which may result from age-related oxidative 
damage or leakage of plasma proteins from the iBRB.
Previously, we have shown that RPE cells undergo significant morphological changes where 
they increase in size and become multinucleated during aging ( Chen et al., 2016 ). If the 
enlarged cell fails to multinucleate it may collapse ( Chen et al., 2016 ). When triple-staining 
of RPE flatmounts for F-actin, ZO-1 and claudin-1, we observed localized loss of ZO-1 but 
not claudin-1 and F-actin in RPE cells of aged mice (Figure 2A), suggesting tight junction 
disruption in the oBRB.
Previously, we and others reported an age-dependent accumulation of subretinal phagocytes 
(Combadiere et al., 2007 , Xu et al., 2008 ), which may result from the low-levels of RPE 
damage. Recent evidence suggests that a proportion of subretinal Iba-1+ cells are recruited 
from circulation ( Hu et al., 2015 , Sennlaub et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, CD3+ T cells (Figure 
2B) were not detected in RPE flatmounts from mice between 16-24 months old. Isolectin-B4 
labels active microglia ( Chen et al., 2010 , Chen et al., 2013 ) and a proportion of Iba-1+ cells 
are Isolectin-B4+ (Figure 2C), suggesting the heterogeneous activation of subretinal 
phagocytes.
Structural alterations of the BRB suggest failure of the avoidance strategy, whereas 
microglial activation and macrophage infiltration are an indication of active resistance in the 
aging eye. Surprisingly, there is no retinal oedema or infiltration T or B lymphocytes in the 
aging retina. A possible explanation is that BRB breakdown in the normal aging eye is 
localized and transient, and the infiltrating T or B cells or leaking fluids are rapidly removed 
from the neuronal retina. An age-dependent increase of the potassium channel (Kir4.1) and 
water channel (aquaporin 4) has been observed in brain glial cells (astrocytes) ( Gupta and 
Prasad, 2013 ). Whether they are also upregulated in the aging retina remains elusive. It is Chen et al. Page 4
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsalso possible that disrupting the barrier solely may not be sufficient to cause retinal oedema 
or detectable levels of lymphocyte infiltration. Additional signals such as VEGF from an 
ischemic retina or chemokines from an inflamed retina would be required. High levels of 
inflammatory cytokines or retinal specific T cells/antibodies in the circulation may penetrate 
the barrier and cause retinal inflammation and oedema. Such pathologies are seen in 
experimental endotoxin induced uveoretinitis ( Rosenbaum et al., 1980 ) and retinal peptide 
immunization induced experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) ( Caspi et al., 1986 , 
Chan et al., 1985 , Mochizuki et al., 1985 ). Patients with geographic atrophy do not exhibit 
significant immune cell infiltration or macular oedema, despite the complete loss of the 
oBRB at the lesion site. Within the atrophic area, photoreceptors are degenerated, and 
oxygen consumption is reduced. Therefore, the macula unlikely suffers from ischemia and 
will not send signals to vascular endothelial cells to induce leakage and macular oedema.
3.2 The impact of age on retinal immune regulation
Retinal cells possess immune regulatory properties which act as the second layer of retinal 
protection ( Caspi, 2006 ) and can also be viewed as a tolerance strategy to maintain 
homeostasis. During aging, retinal cells are subjected to increasing levels of oxidative stress, 
which affects their neuronal functions and immune regulatory properties. Under normal 
physiological conditions, neurons keep retinal microglia and the complement system under 
control by producing various membrane and soluble forms of inhibitory molecules. When 
circulating immune cells infiltrate the retina, these molecules can either induce the death of 
the immune cells or convert them into immunosuppressive cells to reduce immunopathology.
Microglia reside in the inner part of the neuronal retina, including the ganglion layer and the 
inner and outer plexiform layers ( Chen and Xu, 2015 , Karlstetter et al., 2015 ). Microglia are 
activated upon engagement with pathogens or damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs) through various pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) ( Lehnardt et al., 2006 , Provis et al., 1995 ). 
In particular, the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and DNAX 
activation protein 12 (DAP12) signaling is essential for CNS homeostasis ( Colonna, 2003 , 
Painter et al., 2015 ). Activation of TREM2-DAP12 initiates signal transduction pathways 
that promote microglial activation and phagocytosis.
Microglial activation is regulated by various signals from retinal neurons, such as the 
chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine) ( A. E. Cardona et al., 2006 , Mizuno et al., 2003 , Raoul, 
Keller et al., 2008 ), TGF- β (Paglinawan et al., 2003 ), endocannabinoids ( Battista et al., 
2006 , Hernangomez et al., 2014 , Mecha et al., 2016 ), and nerve growth factor ( De Simone et 
al., 2007 ). Additionally, various cell surface molecules expressed by neurons also play an 
important role in controlling microglial activation by direct neuron–microglia interaction. 
Examples of these regulatory signals include the CD200/CD200R ( Dick et al., 2003 , 
Hernangomez et al., 2014 ) and CD47-SIRP ( Zhang et al., 2015 ) pathways and other 
complex formations of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells and ligands on 
neurons (Figure 7A).Chen et al. Page 5

 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts3.2.1 The TREM2-DAP12 pathway in the aging retina— TREM2 can recognize and 
bind to various ligands including dead cells and exogenous pathogens. The primary role of 
the TREM2-DAP12 complex is mediated through the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based 
Activation Motifs (ITAM) of DAP12 ( Mecca et al., 2018 ). TREM2 is a key negative 
regulator of autoimmunity and plays an important role in the inhibition of IL6 and TNF α. 
TREM2 is also responsible for DAP12-induced inhibition of the inflammatory response 
driven by TLR agonists ( Helming et al., 2008 , Turnbull et al., 2006 ). TREM2-DAP12 
signaling is required to sustain the trophic function of microglia in the aging brain ( Poliani et 
al., 2015 ). Furthermore, it plays a positive role in phagocytosis of dead neurons and is 
critically involved in CNS homeostasis ( Piccio et al., 2007 ). TREM2 is a marker for recently 
identified Disease Associated Microglia (DAM). DAM also express CD11c and CFSR, and 
have reduced expression of CX3CR1 ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 ). DAM are only detected in 
the diseased CNS, particularly around the lesion, where they phagocytize debris and protein 
aggregates ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 ). TREM2 is essential for the transition of resting 
microglia into active DAM ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 , Yeh et al., 2017 ).
Exactly how aging impacts the TREM2-DAP12 signaling in the retina remains elusive. 
Expression levels of TREM2 in microglia from the CNS are reduced in aged mice ( Hickman 
and El Khoury, 2014 , Mecca et al., 2018 ). Since this signaling pathway is required for 
microglial proliferation and survival ( Poliani et al., 2015 ), it is possible that a progressive 
decline in TREM2 expression might impair the microglial response to damaged neurons. 
Interestingly, retinal aging is accompanied by an increased number and density of microglia 
(Chen et al., 2013 , Li et al., 2015 ). Further investigation into the dynamic change of TREM2 
expression in the aging retina will help reveal its role in retinal immune regulation.
3.2.2 The CX3CL1-CX3CR1 pathway in the aging retina— In the CNS, including 
the neuronal retina, CX3CR1 is expressed by microglia and CX3CL1 by neurons as a 
transmembrane protein ( Harrison et al., 1998 , Ludwig and Mentlein, 2008 ). The membrane 
form of CX3CL1 in neurons function predominately as an integrin-type adhesion molecule 
that can initiate signaling transduction, rather than a chemokine. The CX3CL1-CX3CR1 
axis mediated neuron-microglia interaction plays an important role in modulating 
physiological activities of the brain during development, adulthood and aging. CX3CL1-
CX3CR1 signaling is known to be involved in synaptic pruning, promoting survival of 
neurons and neural precursors, modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. When 
neuronal damage occurs, microglia rapidly react to protect or eliminate dead neurons. The 
rescue process may be mediated by the production of soluble factors essential for neuron 
survival, modulation of phagocytic activity or an indirect effect upon other cells in the retinal 
parenchyma.
The CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis also controls microglial activation. Early in vitro studies 
demonstrated that CX3CL1 could block LPS- and IFN γ-induced release of cytokines 
(interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), TNFα, 8-isoprostane, nitric oxide (NO) and IL-6) in cultured 
microglia ( Mizuno et al., 2003 , Zujovic et al., 2000 ). Under diabetic conditions, deletion of 
CX3CR1 resulted in significantly higher levels of IL-1 β and VEGF expression along with 
increased retinal microglial activation ( Cardona et al., 2015 ). CX3CR1 deficient mice 
present an exaggerated microglial response to paraquat-mediated retinal damage with Chen et al. Page 6

 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsexcessive expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF α, iNOS, IL-1 β, CCL2) ( Chen, Luo et 
al., 2013 ). Mononuclear phagocytes from CX3CR1 deficient mice express higher levels of 
P2X7 which stimulate IL-1 β maturation, secretion and photoreceptor degeneration ( Hu et 
al., 2015 ).
During aging, the expression level of CX3CL1 is reduced, which is accompanied by 
increased microglial activation ( Mecca et al., 2018 ). Aged CX3CR1 KO mice present with 
photoreceptor degeneration and uncontrolled microglial activation and subretinal 
accumulation ( Combadiere et al., 2007 ). Mononuclear cells with CX3CR1 deficiency 
express higher levels of CCL2 which leads to excessive recruitment and accumulation of 
neurotoxic subretinal macrophages. This process is known to be related to the development 
of age-related photoreceptor degeneration in mice ( Sennlaub et al., 2013 ). Reduced levels or 
loss of CX3CR1 signaling in the aging retina may confer the neurotoxic phenotype of 
microglia, which may put the retina at risk of developing degenerative diseases.
3.2.3 CD200-CD200R pathway in the aging retina— CD200 is a 41-47 kDa protein 
belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family ( Barclay et al., 2002 , Wright et al., 
2001 ). CD200 is expressed throughout the retinal layers and its expression increases during 
inflammation, in both human and rat ( Dick et al., 2001 ). CD200 is also constitutively 
expressed in the normal mouse retina, with high levels in the ganglion layer (GL) (Figure 
3A). CD200R is detected at low levels in the ciliary body and inner retina, with a marked 
increase in EAU ( Dick et al., 2001 ). Low levels of CD200R were also detected in the mouse 
retina (Figure 3B). Interestingly, RPE cells (Arrows in Figure 3B) and corneal epithelial 
cells also express CD200R (data not shown), suggesting that this pathway may also regulate 
epithelial activation. In the CNS and retina, the CD200-CD200R interaction is 
neuroprotective under inflammatory conditions ( Hoek et al., 2000 , Wright et al., 2000 ). 
Deletion of CD200 results in myeloid cell and microglial dysregulation and enhanced 
susceptibility to an autoimmune response ( Hoek et al., 2000 ). Blocking the CD200-CD200R 
signaling pathway aggravates inflammation in EAU ( Banerjee and Dick, 2004 , Broderick et 
al., 2002 ), whereas augmentation of the CD200R signaling suppresses inflammation and 
reduces tissue damage ( Copland et al., 2007 ).
We have found that the mRNA expression of CD200 was significantly reduced in the aging 
(22 months) retina compared with that in the young (3 months) retina (Figure 3C). Retinal 
CD200R expression, however, did not change with age (Figure 3D). Previous work has 
reported an age-mediated reduction in CD200 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of rats 
(Frank et al., 2006 ). Reduction in CD200 expression may weaken the inhibitory signal 
leading to increased microglial activation in the aging retina. Interestingly, CD200 
expression in circulating CD11b monocytes of patients with neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (nAMD) was reported to be increased compared to that in age-matched healthy 
controls ( Singh et al., 2013 ). The biological significance of this observation in AMD 
pathogenesis remains elusive.
3.2.4 CD47-SIRP (CD172) pathway in the aging retina— CD47 and the signal 
regulatory protein (SIRP, also known as CD172) is another neuron-microglia ligand-receptor 
pathway that controls microglial response. CD47 is expressed by neurons, astrocytes, Chen et al. Page 7
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsendothelial cells and various immune cells. SIRP (CD172) is expressed predominately by 
myeloid-derived cells and microglia in the CNS ( Barclay and Brown, 2006 , Brown and 
Frazier, 2001 ). In the normal mouse retina, CD47 expression was found in the GL, inner 
plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) (Figure 3E). SIRP was diffusively 
expressed at low levels in the IPL, INL and OPL, although, high levels of expression were 
observed in some cells in the INL (arrowheads in Figure 3F). The SIRP family consists of 
SIRPα, SIRPβ, and SIRP γ as well as some other closely related proteins. In the brain, 
CD47 and SIRP can be co-expressed in the same cells and their interaction might mediate 
intracellular signaling in a bidirectional manner ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). CD47-SIRP interaction 
recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 leading to inhibition of phagocytosis 
and synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF- β (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005 ). 
Surprisingly, despite the importance of the CD47-SIRP pathway in regulating CNS 
homeostasis and inflammation, little is known about their role in the CNS/retinal aging and 
age-related diseases. Using real-time RT-PCR, we did not observe any significant difference 
in the mRNA expression levels of CD47 (Figure 3G) and SIRP (Figure 3H) between young 
(3-months) and old (22-month) retinas.
Apart from SIRP, CD47 in immune cells partners with integrins such as CD11b and binds 
TSP-1, a secreted glycoprotein that plays an important role in inflammation and 
angiogenesis. The CD47/TSP-1 interaction is known to induce the death of active T cells 
and suppress inflammation ( Barclay and Van den Berg, 2014 , Pettersen, 2000 , Sarfati et al., 
2008 ). A recent study has shown that the CD47/TSP-1 signaling pathway is important for 
the elimination of subretinal mononuclear phagocytes in the aging eye ( Calippe et al., 2017 ). 
Disruption of the pathway, for example, by CFH/CD11b-mediated interaction, inhibits 
subretinal phagocyte elimination, which leads to retinal degeneration ( Calippe et al., 2017 ). 
Further studies are required to understand the role of the CD47/SIRP/TSP-1 pathway in 
retinal aging and age-related retinal diseases.
3.2.5 The endocannabinoid system in the aging retina— Anandamide 
(arachidonoyl-ethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) (both are 
endocannabinoids), cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2 receptors), as well as the 
enzymes that control endocannabinoids synthesis or degradation (FAAH, MGL, and COX2) 
have been detected in the retina, suggesting existence of the endocannabinoid system 
(Schwitzer et al., 2016 , Yazulla, 2008 ). CB1 receptor is expressed in retinal neurons, Müller 
cells, and microglia ( Straiker et al., 1999 ), whereas, the CB2 receptor is believed to be 
expressed predominately by microglia in the CNS ( Lopez et al., 2011 ) and RPE cells in the 
retina ( Wei et al., 2009 ). Activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in microglia induces an 
alternative activation phenotype (M2), which reduces inflammation ( Mecha et al., 2016 ). 
Activation of the CB2 receptor using a selective agonist (JWH-133) can suppress retinal 
inflammation in the mouse model of EAU through down-regulating TLR4/MyD88 
expression ( Xu, Cheng et al., 2007 ). In addition, the endocannabinoids or synthetic 
cannabinoids can alleviate the proinflammatory response in Müller cells ( Krishnan and 
Chatterjee, 2012 , Matias et al., 2006 ). The endocannabinoids-CB1/2 pathway is believed to 
be an important immune regulatory mechanism which controls inflammation in the CNS and 
the retina.Chen et al. Page 8

 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsPrevious studies have shown that the expression of CB1/CB2 receptors ( Pascual, Gaveglio et 
al., 2014 ), the levels of bioavailable 2-AG and the enzyme activity of fatty acid amide 
hydrolase (FAAH) are reduced in the aging brain ( Pascual et al., 2013 , Pascual, Martin-
Moreno et al., 2014 ). We have found that levels of 2-AG and AEA are increased with age in 
normal WT mouse retinas (Figure 4A, 4B). CCL2 KO mice have a significantly higher level 
of 2-AG at a younger age (3-month, Figure 4C), which decreases with age (Figure 4C). AEA 
levels in the CCL2 KO mouse retina, however, was significantly lower at 3- and 18-month of 
age compared with age-controlled WT mice (Figure 4D). Previously, we have shown that 
CCL2 KO mice age-dependently develop retinal degeneration, which is accompanied by 
increased microglial and complement activation ( Chen et al., 2011 ). Dysregulated 
endocannabinoid expression may be related to uncontrolled microglial activation in CCL2 
KO mice. High levels of AEA have been previously reported in the retina, ciliary body and 
choroid of eyes donated by patients with diabetic retinopathy ( Matias et al., 2006 ). 
Interestingly, 2-AG was only increased in the iris of the DR eyes ( Matias et al., 2006 ). High 
levels of AEA were also observed in the choroid of AMD eyes compared with controls, 
while the expression of 2-AG did not significantly change ( Matias et al., 2006 ). However, 
the study did not consider age and other medical conditions of the donors, and the results 
should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the endocannabinoid system is critically 
involved in retinal immune regulation, although, their role in age-mediated retinal para-
inflammation and their contribution to age-related retinal degeneration requires further 
investigation.
3.2.6 The impact of age on RPE immune regulation— RPE cells maintain immune 
privilege status of the subretinal space by segregating the retina from choroidal circulation 
(through oBRB) and actively inhibiting immune activation (through expression of surface 
ligands and soluble molecules) ( Kaestel et al., 2005 , Zamiri et al., 2006 , Zamiri et al., 2007 ). 
RPE-derived inhibitory cues can induce the death of active immune cells or convert them 
into immunosuppressive or regulatory cells ( Kaestel et al., 2005 , Mochizuki et al., 2013 ).
During aging, RPE cells undergo significant morphological and functional changes. RPE 
cell number declines ( Friedman and Ts'o, 1968 , Gao and Hollyfield, 1992 ) and their size 
increase ( Chen et al., 2016 ), with many cells becoming binucleated or multinucleated ( Chen 
et al., 2016 , Friedman and Ts'o, 1968 ). Their phagocytic and lysosomal activities also 
decrease with age ( Wang et al., 2009 ), although the impact of age on their immune 
regulatory functions remains is unknown. Normal healthy RPE cells can upregulate the 
expression of IL-1 β, IL-6, arginase-1 and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) (Figure 5A, 5B), and down-
regulate the expression of TNF α and IL-12 in macrophages (Figure 5A). Complement 
inhibitor C1INH expression in macrophages can also be significantly upregulated by RPE 
(Luo et al., 2018 ). Importantly, the ability of macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic T cells 
is significantly increased after co-culturing with RPE cells (Figure 6A-C, E). The results 
suggest that under normal physiological conditions, RPE cells are able to modulate 
macrophage phenotype and function and promote their ability to remove debris.
When RPE cells were pre-treated with oxidized photoreceptor outer segments (oxPOS), they 
became multinucleated ( Chen et al., 2016 , Rajapakse et al., 2017 ) and acquired a senescent 
phenotype. This was evident by the upregulation of senescence-associated genes (Apo J, Chen et al. Page 9
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsfibronectin, SM22, and osteonectin) ( Lueck et al., 2012 ) and β-galactosidase expression 
(Luo et al., 2018 ). The oxPOS-induced senescent RPE cells expressed higher levels of 
inflammatory mediators such as complement factor B (CFB) ( Chen et al., 2008 ), IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-8, CCL2 ( Higgins et al., 2003 ) and VEGF ( Lueck et al., 2012 ). Our recent study 
suggests that oxPOS induces expression of the cell cycle inhibitor P27Kip1 in RPE cells 
(Rajapakse et al., 2017 ), which may further explain their senescent phenotype. Macrophages 
co-cultured with the senescent RPE cells expressed higher levels of IL-1 β, and IL-6 (Figure 
5A), but lower levels of arginase-1 and PTX3 (Figure 5B), compared to macrophages co-
cultured with normal RPE, indicating a shift towards an inflammatory phenotype. The 
senescent RPE cells maintain the ability to promote macrophage phagocytic function. 
Macrophages pre-treated with the senescent RPE phagocytosed the same amount of 
apoptotic T cells compared to macrophages pre-treated with normal RPE cells (Figure 6C, 
6D, 6E). Taken together, the results suggest that senescent RPE cells maintain immune 
regulatory roles, but with reduced ability.
3.3 The impact of age on retinal immune effectors
The retinal immune effectors include innate immune cells (e.g., microglia, perivascular 
macrophages and dendritic cells ( Chen and Xu, 2015 , Forrester et al., 2010 , Xu, Dawson et 
al., 2007 ) and the complement system ( Xu and Chen, 2016 ). Here we discuss the impact of 
age on retinal microglia and the complement system due to their recognised roles in age-
related retinal degenerative and angiogenic diseases. Circulating monocytes may infiltrate 
the aging retina via the fragile physical barriers (iBRB and oBRB) and differentiate into 
microglia-like cells which participate in retinal defence. Direct evidence supporting the 
existence of infiltrating macrophage in the normal aging retina is lacking. Therefore, the 
topic is not discussed further in this review.
3.3.1 Altered microglial response in the aging retina
3.3.1.1 Microglial functional alterations in the aging retina:  Apart from the age-related 
changes in the regulatory cues from neurons, astrocytes, Müller cells, and RPE cells, retinal 
microglia also present age-related alterations. Under normal physiological conditions, 
microglia patrol the surrounding microenvironment using their highly motile dendrites 
(Figure 7A). The mobility of microglial dendrites reduces with age ( Damani et al., 2011 ). In 
response to injury, aged microglia migrate to the site of damage slower than young microglia 
(Damani et al., 2011 , Ma and Wong, 2016 ). After resolving inflammation and damage 
repair, aged microglia disperse from the damaged site slower than young microglia ( Damani 
et al., 2011 , Ma and Wong, 2016 ). Aging microglia also appear to have increased immune 
vigilance ( Deczkowska et al., 2017 ) with dysregulated phagocytic activity ( Grabert et al., 
2016 , Hickman et al., 2013 ). For example, aged microglia may phagocytize living neurons 
(Zhao et al., 2015 ) or engage in excessive synaptic pruning through complement component 
1q (C1q) leading to the damage of synaptic connections ( Lui et al., 2016 , Morrison and 
Baxter, 2012 ). Aged microglia also display insufficient phagocytic activity towards apoptotic 
bodies, protein aggregates and myelin, resulting in the gradual accumulation of potentially 
toxic compounds which is a hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases ( Safaiyan et 
al., 2016 ). Furthermore, their plasticity to change from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-
inflammatory phenotype is also reduced with age ( Harry, 2013 ). The underlying mechanism Chen et al. Page 10
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptswhich leads to these functional changes in senescent microglia is not fully understood. One 
explanation could be an intrinsic dysfunction of microglia resulting from age (see below). 
Accumulation of oxidative insults in the aging brain and retinal microenvironment may 
increase the workload of microglia, while the changes in retinal metabolism during aging 
may affect the response of microglia to oxidative insults. Furthermore, the reduced 
regulatory cues from neurons may also contribute to a dysregulated microglia response in 
the aging retina (Figure 7B).
3.3.1.2 Transcriptomic changes in aging microglia:  A recent transcriptomic analysis of 
human cortical microglia revealed age-related reductions in the expression of genes involved 
in the actin cytoskeleton system (e.g., TLN1, PFN1 EVL, ARPC1A,  etc.), sensome cell 
surface receptors (e.g., P2RY12, IL6R, TLR10 ) and adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM3, 
ROBO2 ) (Galatro et al., 2017 ). These transcriptional changes may explain the age-related 
alterations in microglial functions (i.e. phagocytosis, migration, immune response etc.). 
Moreover, a genome-wide analysis of microglia from mouse brain has reported region-
specific microglial transcriptional identities and heterogeneous microglial aging in different 
regions ( Grabert et al., 2016 ). One study showed that aging caused a modest decline in the 
expression of key signature genes of microglia across all forebrain regions, with a 
significantly greater reduction in cerebellar microglia ( Grabert et al., 2016 ). The authors 
suggested that microglial diversity may enable localized homeostatic functions which would 
underlie region-specific sensitivities to microglial dysregulation and the involvement in age-
related neurodegeneration ( Grabert et al., 2016 ). Retinal microglia are distributed in 
different layers (GL, IPL and OPL) ( Chen and Xu, 2015 , Karlstetter et al., 2015 ) and 
different regions (e.g., macula and periphery) of the retina. Dysregulated microglial 
activation is known to be involved in all types of age-related retinal degenerative diseases 
(AMD, DR, glaucomatous retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa etc.), with each disease affecting 
different layers/regions of the retina. Whether a regional- or layer-specific microglial aging 
exists in the retina remains to be clarified.
3.3.1.3 Age-related metabolic alteration and retinal microglial activation:  Cells 
metabolize glucose, fatty acids or amino acids to generate ATP and other biomaterials to 
support cellular function. Immune cell activation is critically controlled by metabolic 
pathways ( Kelly and O'Neill, 2015 , Pearce et al., 2013 ). For example, quiescent and 
alternatively activated M2 macrophages and microglia are fueled by mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas proinflammatory M1 macrophages and microglia rely 
on glycolysis to function ( Kelly and O'Neill, 2015 , Orihuela et al., 2016 , Pearce et al., 2013 ). 
Although retina consumes high levels of oxygen (per gram tissue compared to other tissues) 
for function, the oxygen tension, particularly in the outer layers of the retina is extremely 
low (approximately 5 mmHg) ( Yu and Cringle, 2001 ). With age, retinal oxygen supply 
further decreases due to reduced permeability of Bruch’s membrane and vascular basal 
membrane and accumulation of drusen deposits ( Stefansson et al., 2011 ). Thus, the aging 
retina suffers from low-grade chronic ischemia. It is unclear how age affects the supply of 
retinal nutrients (e.g. glucose and fatty acids) as the ischemic condition will likely impair 
mitochondrial respiration. A recent study has shown that glucose and amino acid 
metabolism is significantly altered in the aging retina ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Oxaloacetate, a Chen et al. Page 11
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptscritical metabolite in the TCA cycle and the malate-aspartate shuttle, were significantly 
reduced. Metabolites from glycolysis and mitochondrial OXPHOS were diminished by a 
half in old mouse retinas (73 weeks old) as compared with young retinas (6 weeks old), 
indicating the impairment of glucose utilization ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Microglial activation is 
likely to be affected by the impaired glycolysis and mitochondrial OXPHOS in the aging 
retina.
Macrophages and microglia are specialized in metabolizing fatty acids, an essential function 
for eliminating cholesterols that they acquire through phagocytosis of dead cells. Cholesterol 
metabolism and mitochondrial OXPHOS are impaired in aged macrophages ( Lin et al., 
2018 ), leading to intracellular accumulation of oxidized cholesterols ( Lin et al., 2018 ). 
Subretinal mononuclear phagocytes in the aging eye contain large amounts of 
autofluorescent lipofuscins ( Luhmann et al., 2009 , Xu et al., 2008 ), which may result from 
undigested fatty acids. Free fatty acids (e.g. cholesterol) can bind to and activate several 
transcription factors, including liver X receptor α and β (LXRα and LXR β), retinoid X 
receptor (RXR) and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 
family (PPAR α and PPAR γ), resulting in inflammatory gene expression ( Remmerie and 
Scott, 2018 ). Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism in aged macrophages may underlie their 
inflammatory phenotype. Further studies will be necessary to understand how microglial 
activation in the aging retina is regulated by metabolic changes.
3.3.2 Altered complement response in the aging retina— Previously, we and 
others have shown that the retina has a complement regulatory system ( Chen and Xu, 2015 , 
Xu et al., 2009 , Xu and Chen, 2016 ) and retinal cells, in particular microglia and RPE cells 
can produce various complement proteins and regulators ( Anderson et al., 2010 , Luo et al., 
2011 ). Under normal physiological conditions, retinal cells express relatively higher levels 
of complement regulators (e.g., CFH, C1INH, and CD59) and lower levels of complement 
proteins (e.g. C1q, C3, and CFB) ( Anderson et al., 2010 , Xu et al., 2009 ) (Figure 8A). 
Complement expression has been shown to increase in the aging retina ( Anderson et al., 
2010 , Chen et al., 2008 , Xu et al., 2009 ), meaning the complement system may be active in 
the retinal immune defense against aging insults. Complement proteins such as C1q and the 
C3 fragment C3b can opsonize debris and dead cells, as a result promoting their clearance 
by phagocytes ( He et al., 2008 , Mevorach et al., 1998 , Takizawa et al., 1996 ).
In the aging retina, the expression of complement regulators is generally down-regulated, 
whereas the expression of complement proteins is up-regulated (Figure 8B). This may be 
caused by multiple mechanisms. On the one hand, age-related oxidative insults can directly 
modulate complement expression in retinal cells. For example, oxPOS can reduce the 
expression of complement inhibitor CFH ( Chen et al., 2007 ) but increase the expression of 
CFB in RPE cells ( Chen et al., 2008 ). On the other hand, the immune suppressive 
microenvironment is altered during aging, which potentially disrupts the production of 
various complement regulators (C4bp, C1INH, DAF and CD59) by RPE and microglia ( Luo 
et al., 2011 , Luo et al., 2013 ). RPE cells can promote the expression of complement 
regulators in macrophage ( Luo et al., 2018 ), but this ability is reduced when RPE undergoes 
senescence ( Luo et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines released by subretinal Chen et al. Page 12
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsmacrophages may upregulate the expression of complement proteins and down-regulate the 
expression of complement regulators in RPE cells ( Luo et al., 2011 ) (Figure 8B).
3.4 Age-related changes in intraocular compartment mediated systemic immune 
regulation
Once the antigens breach the ocular barriers and reach the immune privileged compartments 
such as the anterior chamber, vitreous cavity and subretinal space, they can induce antigen-
specific immune tolerance (e.g. ACAID and VCAID) to minimize ocular immunopathology 
(Jiang et al., 1993 , Streilein, 1995 ). A previous study has found that aged C57BL/6 mice and 
Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) rats both maintain ACAID. However, ACAID cannot be 
induced in aged rd/rd mice, where the photoreceptors are degenerated ( Welge-Lussen et al., 
1999 ). The loss of ACAID in aged rd/rd mice is known to be associated with lower levels of 
TGFβ2 in the aqueous humour ( Welge-Lussen et al., 1999 ).
Hyalocytes are the resident immune cells in the vitreous cavity and their density is increased 
in aged mice ( Vagaja et al., 2012 ). Immune cells are normally absent in the subretinal space, 
however, microglia and macrophages migrate there with age ( Combadiere et al., 2007 , 
Raoul, Feumi et al., 2008 , Xu et al., 2008 ). An increased number of hyalocytes and 
accumulation of subretinal phagocytes would undoubtedly affect immune regulation in the 
vitreous cavity and the subretinal space. Whether aging directly affects the immune 
deviation remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that retinal laser burn-induced 
neuropathy can lead to loss of ACAID ( Qiao et al., 2009 ) through upregulation of substance 
P (Lucas et al., 2012 ). The results suggest that the systemic immune regulatory function of 
the eye may be lost in patients with retinal neuropathy. This would subsequently have 
implications in the pathogenesis of various retinal diseases. Impaired or lost ocular chamber-
induced immune deviation in AMD, DR or glaucoma could initiate a retinal antigen-specific 
T or B cell response when retinal antigens are released into the ocular chamber from dead 
cells. Indeed, autoantibodies have been detected in AMD ( Cherepanoff et al., 2006 , Gu et 
al., 2003 ), DR ( Ahn et al., 2006 ) and glaucoma ( Tezel et al., 1999 , Tezel et al., 2004 , Wax, 
Yang et al., 2001 , Wax, Tezel et al., 2001 ). The autoimmunity response, despite at low 
levels, may further damage the neuronal retina. A recent study has shown that transient 
elevation of intraocular pressure induces heat shock protein (HSP)-specific T cell infiltration 
and sustained ganglion cell degeneration in glaucomatous mice and human glaucoma 
patients ( Chen et al., 2018 ). The development of retinal autoantibodies or CD4 T cells in 
these patients may be related to loss of ocular chamber-induced immune deviation.
4 The impact of systemic inflammation in the aging retina
A low level of peripheral systemic inflammation can induce neuroinflammation, which may 
increase the susceptibility of neuronal degeneration. A previous study has shown that 
intraperitoneal injection of LPS induced brain microglial activation and increased production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF α and IL-1 β) (Xie et al., 2017 ). Depletion of 
circulating monocytes or blocking the CD200-CD200R pathway attenuated peripheral LPS-
induced CNS inflammation ( Xie et al., 2017 ). The results suggest that peripheral 
inflammation can be transmitted into the CNS. In the eye, it is well known that peripheral Chen et al. Page 13
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsLPS stimulation induces intraocular inflammation (uveitis) ( Rosenbaum et al., 1980 ). 
Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of LPS ( Vagaja et al., 2012 ) or topical application of 
TLR9 or TLR7/8 agonists can induce low-levels of retinal inflammation including, increased 
hyalocyte density ( Vagaja et al., 2012 ) and subretinal accumulation of activated microglia 
(Chinnery et al., 2011 , Chinnery et al., 2015 ), suggesting that peripheral inflammation may 
also be transmitted into the retina, although, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
Circulating immune cells and inflammatory mediators including complement proteins may 
gain access to the retina through the choroid. The wall of the choriocapillaris facing Bruch’s 
membrane is fenestrated with approximately 800 Å circular openings, which allow easy 
movement of macromolecules into the extra-capillary compartment ( Anand-Apte, 2010 ). 
During systemic inflammation, such as infection, pathogens and inflammatory mediators 
(e.g. complement proteins, chemokines and cytokines) can escape from leaky vessels and 
percolate through Bruch’s membrane to the basal side of the RPE leading to re-structuring 
of tight junctions and breakdown of the oBRB. Access of peripheral pathogens or circulating 
inflammatory molecules to the neuroretina may become easier in the aging eye due to weak 
BRBs (Section 3.1 Figure 2A). Recent discovery of intraocular microbiota in the aqueous 
humor of uveitis patients and soft drusen of AMD patients ( Wen et al., 2018 ) suggests that 
the retina is not totally insulated from the peripheral circulation.
Aging is associated with low-levels of systemic inflammation (inflammaging) ( Franceschi 
and Campisi, 2014 , Goto, 2008 ) and infections occur frequently in aged people due to 
immune senescence. It is possible that systemic inflammation, particularly from acute 
infection in old people may cause low-levels of retinal inflammation, which may negatively 
impact on retinal immune privilege.
5 Conclusions and therapeutic implications
With age, the three layers of protection that maintains retinal immune privilege undergo 
substantial changes. Physical barriers, including the iBRB and oBRB appear to be weakened 
due to age-related dysfunction of endothelial and glial cells in the neurovascular unit and 
RPE (Table 1). Immune regulatory signals from retinal neurons or RPE cells are also altered. 
CX3CL1 and CD200 expression in neurons is reduced, whereas, the production of 
endocannabinoid 2-AG and AEA is increased in the aging retina. The ocular chamber-
mediated systemic immune suppression (deviation) may be lost during aging due to reduced 
TGFβ expression and immune cell infiltration into the chamber (Table 1). Reduction in 
passive protection (i.e. avoidance and tolerance) makes the retina more susceptible to insults 
such as oxidative stress in AMD, hyperglycemia in diabetes and elevated intraocular 
pressure in glaucoma.
The immune effectors (i.e. microglia and the complement system) that safeguard the retina 
also undergo significant age-related changes. Age reduces the mobility of microglia, which 
causes their phagocytic function to decline as well as their shift to a proinflammatory 
phenotype when responding to danger molecules. In addition, the expression of complement 
inhibitors is reduced, and the expression of complement activators is increased in the aging 
retina (Table 1). Therefore, on the one hand, aged microglia have a reduced ability to carry Chen et al. Page 14
Prog Retin Eye Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts
  Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsout their immune surveillance and synapse maintenance roles, leading to accumulation of 
damaged neurons and debris. On the other hand, the proinflammatory response of microglia 
and the complement system to damaged neurons and debris increases the immunopathology.
In the degenerative retina (e.g. AMD and DR), barriers may be damaged at the lesion site 
and immune suppressive pathways could be altered or lost (Table 1). However, patients can 
remain asymptomatic for years at the early stages of the disease, suggesting that avoidance 
and tolerance strategies are still functioning sufficiently to keep the retina privileged or 
partially privileged from systemic immune attack. The defense system (e.g. retinal microglia 
and the complement system) is likely to be activated constantly at low levels in the diseased 
retina due to an increase in tissue damage from aging or diabetes (Table 1). Improving the 
defense and tolerance mechanisms to maintain or restore retinal immune privilege in the 
aging and degenerative retina would be a preferred approach for disease retardation or 
prevention.
Intraocular drug delivery is a well-accepted and widely-used approach for treating retinal 
diseases. Cell-based therapies have shown promising effects in preclinical studies and phase 
1/2 clinical trials for end-stage AMD patients ( Jones et al., 2017 ). The altered immune 
privilege of the aging and degenerative retina may negatively affect the materials (e.g. cells, 
drug carriers and genes) that are delivered into the vitreous cavity or subretinal space. 
Thorough studies on the impact of retinal immune response to the materials may help to 
improve the efficacy and success rate of intraocular drug, gene and cell therapy.

  Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsFigure 7. Age-related alterations in retinal microglial activation and function.
(A) Under normal physiological conditions, microglia patrol retinal microenvironment 
through crawling dendrites. Microglia may be activated after engaging with Damage 
Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) by cell surface receptors such as TLRs, NLRs and 
IL-1Rs. This activation process is tightly controlled by various signals from surrounding 
neurons (e.g., CX3CL1-CX3CR1, CD200-CD200R, CD47-SIRP-1, etc.). (B) During aging, 
oxidative stress damages retinal neurons leading to the weakening of negative regulatory 
signals and the accumulation of DAMPs. This results in low-levels of sustained microglial 
activation. In the meantime, sustained chronic oxidative stress also damages microglial 
function.Chen et al. Page 34

(A) Under normal physiological conditions, retinal cells, including microglia, RPE and 
neurons express various complements and complement regulators. The expression levels of 
complement inhibitors such as CFH, C1INH and CD59 is relatively higher than that of 
complement components such as C3 and C5. Low levels of complement expression and 
activation is critical for retinal homeostasis. (B) During aging, oxidative stress and low-
levels of inflammation reduce the expression of complement inhibitors but increase the 
expression of complement components (e.g., CFB and C3). BM – Bruch’s Membrane; RPE

(transient).✧Substantial damage of iBRB and oBRB at the 
lesion site, unable to repair.
Tolerance✧Strong suppressive and tolerogenic 
signals from neurons and RPE cells.
✧Ocular compartment-mediated 
immune deviation maintained 
(ACAID, V AID, SRSID).✧Reduced: CD200, CX3CR1, TGF β, TREM2, others (?).
✧Increased: IL-10, endocannabinoids, others (?)
✧Ocular compartment-mediated immune deviation 
maintained.✧Reduced or complete loss of inhibitory signals 
from neurons and RPE cells at the lesion site. 
The remaining neurons and RPE cells may 
maintain immune suppressive with reduced 
capacity.
✧Loss of ocular compartment-mediated immune

Outcome on 
Immune privilege✧Retina maintains as an immune 
privileged tissue;
✧Vitreous cavity and subretinal space 
are immune privileged sites.✧Retina remains privileged, but at risk of immune attach 
due to weak barriers and reduced suppressive capacity.
✧Vitreous cavity and subretinal space remain as sites of IP, 
but at risk of inducing inflammation due to low-level of 
immune cell infiltration.✧Retina suffers from inflammatory attack at the 
lesion site. The unaffected area may remain 
partially privileged.
✧Vitreous cavity (e.g., in DR) and subretinal 
space (e.g., in AMD) may lose immune 
regulatory capacity.
Defense✧Resting microglia patrolling 
microenvironment using motile 
dendrites.
✧Low-levels of complement 
expression without overt complement 
activation.✧Microglia undergo mild activation and low-levels of 
proliferation.
✧Microglia migrate to out retinal layers and subretinal 
space.
✧Low levels of macrophage infiltration (?)
✧Low levels of complement activation in neuronal retina 
and retina-choroid interface.✧Microglia activation.
✧Immune cell (T cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils, etc) infiltration.
✧Dysregulated complement activation.
