Abstract: Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of rare eye diseases caused by gene muta-
tions that result in the degradation of cone and rod photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium.
Retinal degradation progress is often irreversible, with clinical manifestations including color or night
blindness, peripheral visual defects and subsequent vision loss. Thus, gene therapies that restore
functional retinal proteins by either replenishing unmutated genes or truncating mutated genes
are needed. Coincidentally, the eye’s accessibility and immune-privileged status along with major
advances in gene identiﬁcation and gene delivery systems heralded gene therapies for IRDs. Among
these clinical trials, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based
gene therapy drug, was approved by the FDA for treating patients with conﬁrmed biallelic RPE65
mutation-associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) in 2017. This review includes current IRD
gene therapy clinical trials and further summarizes preclinical studies and therapeutic strategies for
LCA, including adeno-associated virus-based gene augmentation therapy, 11-cis-retinal replacement,
RNA-based antisense oligonucleotide therapy and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing therapy. Understand-
ing the gene therapy development for LCA may accelerate and predict the potential hurdles of future
therapeutics translation. It may also serve as the template for the research and development of
treatment for other IRDs.

1. Introduction
Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) encompass various eye diseases. Patients af-
fected with inherited retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and choroideremia (CHM) often experience
gradual loss of night vision and may also develop tunnel vision [ 1,2]. Others, with Leber
congenital amaurosis (LCA), may be born with or experience the early onset of vision
loss [ 3]. Patients with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) are commonly observed to
present early-onset macular degeneration, loss in visual acuity and the splitting of retinal
layers [ 4]. The irreversible progress of visual impairment and lack of effective treatments
highlight the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Due to the immune-privileged
characteristics of eyes and the continuous identiﬁcation of causative genes, gene therapy
may hold great promises for treating IRDs. This review provides an overview of retinal
gene therapy development by summarizing signiﬁcant contributions and important clinical
trials to date (Table 1).Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 3 of 24

2. Current Developments in Retinal Gene Therapy
2.1. Technological Breakthrough
Advances in the identiﬁcation of causative genes inextricably propel the progress in
retinal gene therapy. The identiﬁcation of crucial driver genes of disease onset/progression
provides signiﬁcant insights into the disease mechanisms and creates the possibility of
targeting these genes therapeutically. The delineation of speciﬁc underlying genomic
and genetic factors in molecular diagnosis establishes the basis for gene augmentation
and editing therapeutic designs. Currently, researchers have identiﬁed 260 driver genes
for IRDs [ 18]. Recent advances in manipulating genetic material and the accumulation
of several tools to tailor genetic elements gave gene therapy momentum as a promising
upcoming ﬁeld.
2.2. Retina, the Ideal Playground for Gene Therapy
A nonrenewable part of the central nervous system, the retina, is a desirable target
for gene therapy due to the complex innate visual signal transmission that modernized
tools cannot restore. Moreover, the eye’s unique nature promotes the appropriateness
and advantages of gene therapy application for retinal diseases [ 19], which foster intense
exploration and innovation. The retinal cells do not reproduce after birth; therefore, a single
dose of the vector can ensure long-term expression of the transgene [ 20]. Furthermore, the
eye is naturally small and easily approachable with intravitreal and subretinal injections.
Its small volume allows low quantities of vectors or cells to reach the optimal concentration.
Since the ocular compartment is isolated, signiﬁcant extraocular leakage is rare, which
lessens the risks and complexities. The blood–retina barrier assures the immune privilege
status, making foreign antigens and viral vector exposure tolerable; additionally, the
barrier also provides the antigen-speciﬁc inhibition of both cellular and humoral immune
responses [21].
2.3. Gene Delivery Systems
Despite the continuous discovery of novel IRD driver genes, the translation of virus-
mediated gene delivery into the clinic faces several hurdles. Due to the very nature of
gene delivery with integrating vectors, translation/application/viability of gene therapy
was limited by constitutive/ inherent elicitation of the immune response, insertional
mutagenesis, viral tropism, off-target activity and undesired/high proﬁle adverse clinical
events [ 22,23]. Despite being a potentially powerful tool for correcting a disease at the
genetic level, the inability to accomplish controlled manipulation and safe transgene
insertion limited real-life applications of gene therapy. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of safe
and convenient vectors to address these concerns was critical in gene therapy advancement.
Currently, gene therapy has diverged into virus-mediated and physical mechanism-based
(including application of nanomaterials) gene delivery approaches. Viral vectors are
primarily represented by adenovirus (AV), lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV).
As adenovirus vectors are immunogenic and lentivirus vectors integrate into the genome,
AAV vectors are the most preferred choice for practical use. Integration into the genome
may be inﬂuenced by the local chromatin structure at the targeted genome site and affect
the transgene and native neighboring genes’ expression. Wild type AAVs are replication-
incompetent viruses that require helper AVs to enter the lytic cycle, moreover, Rep protein
supplied in trans eliminates the ability of genomic integration. The recombinant adeno-
associated virus (rAAV) genome is processed into a double-stranded circular episome
that is maintained extrachromosomally. The chromatin-like structure of the AAV vector
genome elicits no negative effects to host cells and enables long-term transgene expression
in non-dividing cells [ 24]. The property of cell-selective targeting based on a serotype and
low immunogenicity made AAVs a real workhorse of gene therapy [ 19]. Furthermore,
pseudotyping, a process of creating virus hybrids, is now used to further exploit/reﬁne the
tropism and transduction efﬁciency of each serotype [25–27].Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 6 of 24
3. Leber Congenital Amaurosis
3.1. Clinical Characteristics and Genetics
Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a rare IRD with a worldwide prevalence of
1/30,000 to 1/81,000 of newborn babies, which accounts for 5% of all IRDs [ 28]. LCA
patients may often experience profound vision loss, pendular nystagmus and severe retinal
degeneration in infancy or early childhood.
LCA comprises a genetically heterogeneous group of mainly autosomal-recessive
retinopathies beginning in infancy and childhood, with at least 21 mutated genes and over
400 mutations identiﬁed to date [ 29]. These genes regulate such processes as intrapho-
toreceptor ciliary transport ( CEP290, IQCB1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, SPATA7, TULP1, IFT140 ),
photoreceptor morphogenesis ( CRB1, CRX, GDF6, CLUAP1, PRPH2 ), phototransduction
(AIPL1, GUCY2D, RD3 ), retinoid cycle ( LRAT, RDH12, RPE65 ), signal transduction ( CABP4,
KCNJ13 ), retinal differentiation ( OTX2 ), guanine synthesis ( IMPDH1 ), outer segment phago-
cytosis ( MERTK ), coenzyme NAD biosynthesis ( NMNAT1 ), subcomponent of a chaperon
complex ( CCT2 ) or other protein unknown function ( DTHD1 ) [29,30].
Due to the wide range of genotypic variability, the clinical phenotypes in carriers
of LCA mutations are also highly heterogeneous. Variable ophthalmic disorders range
from essentially normal to those characterized by refractive errors, photoaversion, nyc-
talopia, oculodigital reﬂex, peripheral chorioretinal atrophy, intraretinal pigment migration,
drusen-like deposits, keratoconus and cataracts. Some LCA cases even show neurologic,
intellectual, or psychomotor developmental delays [ 31–35]. In total, there are 18 recognized
types of LCA, among them, LCA type 2 (LCA2) is caused by the mutation in the RPE65
gene on chromosome 1p31. Mutations in this gene also cause retinitis pigmentosa. On the
other hand, LCA10 is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene on chromosome 12q21. Both
homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of these genes were found to cause
LCA2 and LCA10 [36].
3.2. Disease Mechanisms: Interdependence of Photoreceptors and RPE
The end stages of IRDs are generally characterized by irreversible progressive thinning
of the retina with the loss of RPE and neurosensory retinal cells that lead to severe visual
dysfunction or total blindness. Severe perturbation of gross retinal structure mainly
involves the retina’s thinning upon photoreceptor cell death [ 37]. Moreover, IRDs also cause
structural changes, such as rosette-like structure formation in retinitis pigmentosa [ 38] and
the physical separation of cells at the outer plexiform layer in retinoschisis [37].
The pathophysiological mechanisms of LCA are related to the disruption of pho-
totransduction and visual cycle and affect the complex homeostatic interplay between
photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. RPE underlies the retina
and serves as an immune-privileged structure that separates the photoreceptor layer and
choroidal vasculature. Therefore, the role of RPE as a physical barrier is in maintaining
photoreceptor viability by providing nutrients from the choroidal blood supply and trans-
porting away waste products from the photoreceptors [ 39]. Photoreceptors are specialized
neurons containing the outer segments (OS) composed of stacked membranous disc car-
rying phototransduction proteins, opsins, which are responsible for converting captured
light to electric signals. RPE phagocytoses 10% of OS discs daily and renews a complete
OS in 10–15 days [40].
The visual cycle’s physiology depends on the photoreceptor’s integrity and func-
tions, as well as on the supporting RPE cells. Therefore, immune-mediated and oxidative
stress-mediated RPE damage and malfunction may lead to atrophic age-related macular
degeneration with progressive loss of photoreceptors and choroid instability. RPE de-
generation induced by the mutations affecting photoreceptor OS in Stargardt’s macular
dystrophy emphasizes the interdependence between these two retinal layers in maintaining
their structural integrity [8].Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 7 of 24
3.3. Visual Cycle and the Role of RPE65
The visual cycle is initiated by the light activation of visual pigment opsin in the
photoreceptor cells (Figure 1). Opsins are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that contain
the covalently attached cofactor, 11-cis-retinal. The single photon of light results in the
conversion of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, which leads to a change in the conformation
of the opsin’s protein moiety. The latter triggers a signal transduction cascade resulting in
the closure of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels, which changes the membrane potential,
generating nerve impulses that are transduced to the central nervous system to generate
vision. On the other hand, all-trans-retinal is reduced into all-trans-retinol and diffuses into
adjacent RPE through the interphotoreceptor matrix. The transfer of all-trans-retinol into
RPE is mediated by the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). In RPE cells,
all-trans-retinol is esteriﬁed into all-trans-retinyl esters by lecithin retinol acyltransferase
(LRAT). All-trans-retinyl esters are converted to 11-cis-retinol by RPE65, followed by the
oxidization of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. This 11-cis-retinal then diffuses back to the
OS of photoreceptor cells, where it is recombined with the opsin polypeptide to form
photoactive pigment to complete the cycle [41–43].
Figure 1. Outline of retinoid metabolism in the visual cycle. The activation of opsin by light triggers
a series of conversions starting from 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal. The cycle is completed by
recombination of 11-cis-retinal with opsin protein to form the photoactive pigment. IRBP: interpho-
toreceptor retinoid-binding protein; LRAT: lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RPE65: Retinal pigmented
epithelium-speciﬁc protein with molecular mass 65 kDa.
RPE65 is a 65-kD protein speciﬁcally expressed in the RPE, which possesses isomero-
hydrolase enzymatic activity that is required to regenerate 11-cis-retinal [ 38,44,45]. The
RPE65 gene contains fourteen coding exons spanning 20 kb. In contrast to other genes
whose defects also play a contributing role in degenerative retinopathies, RPE65 is among
the genes expressed exclusively in the RPE [ 44,45].RPE65 mutations interrupt the regular
retinoid cycle, resulting in the absence of light-sensitive visual pigment in photoreceptors
and blindness.
4. Preclinical Studies of the RPE65 Gene Therapy of LCA
The ultimate goal of preclinical efforts is to achieve gene delivery to a group of
heterogeneous patients who may present with different LCA onset and retinal degenerationInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 8 of 24
status. The non-degenerated retina is deﬁned as one that suffers from metabolic dysfunction
only, whereby the interrupted retinoid cycle may be restored by the wild type RPE65
gene replacement. In contrast, the degenerated retina is characterized by the loss of
photoreceptors that may beneﬁt more from visual prosthetics or stem cell therapeutics.
The role of RPE65 mutations in the etiology of LCA was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1997 [ 45]. The
dog model of RPE65 -mutated LCA was established in 1998 [ 46], and was used for preclinical
studies in 2001 [ 47]. The ﬁrst clinical trial in humans was carried out in 2007 [ 5,48]. In a 2009
follow-up study, researchers identiﬁed the presence of AAV particles in primates from the
study initiated six years ago, in 2003, raising safety issues and immunological concerns [ 49].
Together, these studies highlighted the need to identify possible roadblocks to clinical
translation for the beneﬁt of other gene therapies targeting retinal degeneration [ 50]. A
roadmap of preclinical studies towards the success of RPE65-based gene therapy is shown
in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Preclinical milestones of establishing the RPE65 -based gene therapy.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 9 of 24
5. Therapeutic Strategies and Clinical Milestones for LCA
Based on the establishments preclinical studies had achieved in gene augmentation
therapy, clinical applications of various gene therapy strategies were carried out interconti-
nentally in the US along with University of London, Nantes University Hospital in France
and Hadassah Medical Organization in Israel. Besides gene augmentation therapy that
helps restore RPE65 by supplementing unmutated gene segments, other therapeutic strate-
gies such as RNA-based antisense oligonucleotide therapy that reduce aberrant splicing
and increase wildtype CEP290 production, 11-cis retinal therapy and gene editing therapy
are as well in the run towards clinical feasibility (Table 2).
5.1. Gene Augmentation Therapy
Since the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of the RPE65 gene, researchers have successfully demon-
strated safety and proof-of-principle studies using recombinant-AAV in LCA2 murine and
canine models. These initial animal model studies encouraged further research in applying
gene augmentation therapy in the human retina, which eventually led to human clinical
trial approval [ 51]. Clinical trials by various groups began in 2007, including Spark Thera-
peutics in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania testing their AAV2-hRPE65v2
vector, Applied Genetic Technology in collaboration with the University of Florida testing
rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 and the NHS foundation trust in collaboration with the University of
London testing rAAV2/2.hRPE65p.hRPE65. Moreover, by 2008, all three groups conﬁrmed
that the vector delivery was safe, and no adverse events were reported [ 5,48,52]. In 2011,
a clinical phase I/II trial for the treatment of LCA2 patients started in France [ 53]. A
schematic graph of how gene augmentation drug exerts it therapeutic effect is shown in
Figure 3.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 10 of 24

(EDIT-101) and RNA antisense nucleotide-based therapy (QR-110). Top panel: gene editing therapy based on AAV-mediated subretinal delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 system that results in
excision of intronic IVS26 mutation in the photoreceptor CEP290 gene that causes abnormal splicing and termination of translation due to introduced cryptic exon. Middle panel: therapy
based on intravitreal delivery of RNA antisense oligonucleotides targeting intronic mutation if CEP290 gene that causes abnormal splicing. Oligonucleotides act at RNA level directing
normal splicing of mutated pre-mRNAs. Bottom panel: gene augmentation aimed to correct the effect of the mutated RPE65 in RPE is based on the delivery of the wild type RPE65 gene by
AAV vector to the subretinal area. Thus, normal RPE65 protein is partially restored, resulting in vision function improvement.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 12 of 24
5.1.1. Voretigene Neparvovec-Rzyl (Luxturna)
In 2007, Spark Therapeutics started the phase I trial of AAV2-hRPE65v2-based voreti-
gene neparvovec-rzyl medication. Three months follow up showed that three patients
with LCA2 demonstrated an acceptable safety proﬁle with modest improvement in retinal
function measured by subjective visual acuity tests. Although one patient developed an
asymptomatic macular hole, which is an adverse event, the retinal function was never-
theless restored [ 48]. One year follow up showed that all patients exhibited a sustained
improvement in measurements such as dark adaptometry, pupillometry, electroretinogra-
phy, nystagmus and ambulatory behavior. A subgroup of children who gained ambulatory
vision showed the most signiﬁcant vision improvement [7].
Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl entered phase I/II in 2010. Consistently with the phase
I trial, both safety and efﬁcacy proﬁle endpoints met expectations for at least 1.5 years.
Furthermore, the subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2 was performed in three subjects,
and the retinal function measurements persisted from 1 month to 1.5 years postinjection
time points. The safety proﬁle elicited no severe adverse events, although a transient
rise in anti-AAV capsid antibodies in several patients was observed. The trial resulted in
continuous function amelioration by showing improvements in velocity and amplitude of
PLR, light sensitivity and reduction in nystagmus. The positive results in both safety and ef-
ﬁcacy measurements further supported the usability of AAV-mediated gene augmentation
therapy in treating RPE65 -associated LCA [54].
In 2012, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl entered phase III and began to be administered
into the contralateral eye. Previous exposure to the viral antigens may have prompted an
immune response that could compromise the effect of the second administration. Con-
cerned with safety, the team readministered the vector to the second eye of three adults at
1.7 to 3.3 years after the initial subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2. After six months,
the evaluation of clinical examinations and immunological responses indicated the safety
of interventions. In addition, the subjects showed improvements in visual/retinal function
and cortical activation after the readministration of gene therapy [ 55]. AAV2-hRPE65v2
gene therapy successfully improved mean mobility and full-ﬁeld light sensitivity after
administration to the contralateral eye. To summarize, the evaluation of safety, immune
response, retinal and visual functions and activation of the visual cortex, all supported the
usability of AAV2-hRPE65v2 for gene augmentation therapy in RPE65 -associated LCA [ 56].
Maximum visual and retinal function improvements were observed at 6 months post-
treatment, and the improvement increased persistently throughout the trial [ 57]. Voretigene
neparvovec-rzyl gene augmentation was shown to improve the visual function in RPE65 -
mediated LCA, with only two intervention participants having shown severe adverse
events unrelated to the treatment, with other adverse events being mild [ 8]. The drug
entered the ﬁnal phase of clinical trials in 2019 with the observation phase. The completion
of phase III trials made voretigene neparvovec-rzyl the ﬁrst FDA-approved gene therapy
for a genetic disease now sold under the commercial name Luxturna.
5.1.2. tgAAG76
In 2007, University College London (UCL) in collaboration with Moorﬁelds Eye Hospi-
tal NHS Foundation Trust initiated a phase I/II trial to test their product, rAAV2/2.hRPE65p.
hRPE65 (tgAAG76). The result demonstrated that three young adult patients receiving
subretinal injections developed no serious adverse effects. The evaluation revealed that
tgAAG76 delivery did not result in any signiﬁcant changes in retinal functions assessed by
objective measurements. However, one patient signiﬁcantly improved visual mobility and
visual function on microperimetry and dark-adapted perimetry. One of the participants
showed increased sensitivity to light and improved in an obstacle course under dim light.
In summary, only very modest and temporary improvements in retinal sensitivity were
observed rather than robust and durable therapeutic effects [5].
In 2016, the UCL team modiﬁed the rAAV2/2 vector to enhance RPE65 production
efﬁciency without exceeding the tolerated vector dose to tackle the problem of possibleInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 13 of 24
intraocular inﬂammation. The modiﬁed vector, named AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65, contained
an optimized promoter sequence, exogenous intron, optimized Kozak sequence, as well
as codon optimization of the RPE65 sequence. The AAV2/5 vector was used due to its
superior gene delivery effectiveness to human RPE cells than the AAV2/2 vector [ 58]. The
UCL team then successfully carried this modiﬁed vector into phase I/II in 2016.
5.1.3. rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65
The phase I trial of the University of Florida’s rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 began in 2007,
whereby three young adults aged 21-24 years were recruited and received uniocular sub-
retinal injections. Follow up lasted for 90 days, and the therapy passed safety requirements
since no severe adverse events or systemic toxicity were detected. The participants showed
limited visual acuity improvement, yet they all reported that the treated eye had better
visual sensitivity than the contralateral eye, especially under dim light [52]. The measure-
ments at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year time points indicated that rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65
augmentation did not elicit vector-related serious adverse events, and those signiﬁcant im-
provements in visual sensitivity reported at the 3 month-time point extended to 12 months.
The safety and efﬁcacy of rAAV2-RPE65 gene therapy could last at least one year post-
treatment [ 59]. There was no systemic toxicity reported for safety concerns, while ocular
adverse events were due to surgery [ 60]. Until 2015, the clinical trials indicated that visual
gain was detectable within the ﬁrst month and efﬁcacy could persist for at least three years.
Longer follow-up observations found that although the treated eye’s improved vision
persisted, there was progressive photoreceptor degeneration which caused a diminution of
visual sensitivity [6].
5.1.4. rAAV2/4-hRPE65
rAAV2/4-hRPE65 underwent a phase 1/2 trial in 2011 conducted by the University
of Nantes, and the results were reported in 2018. All patients showed good immune
tolerance to the vector with improved visual acuity, visual ﬁeld and cortical activations
along visual pathways [ 10]. In this study, patients were segregated into cohorts based on
the age and dose of the viral vector injected. Le Meur et al. identiﬁed that, compared
with previous clinical trials of other vectors, the dosage designed for the rAAV2/4 vector
(1.221010vgto 4.81010vg) was lower than that for vectors from other studies (rang-
ing from 1.51010vgto 6.111011vg), indicative that in haplodeﬁcient diseases, the
designed dosage may have been insufﬁcient to restore enough functional protein to slow
down the degeneration process and improve visual function.
5.2. 11-Cis-Retinal Replacement: QLT091001
QLT091001, a synthetic 9-cis-retinyl acetate, is an oral drug that serves as a replacement
for the missing 11-cis-retinal, which combines with opsin to form its photoactive form
required for the phototransduction cascade. The chromophore reaches the retina in a non-
invasive manner and can be withdrawn if necessary. It enables bypassing through the block
of the retinoid cycle and helps to preserve the morphology of the retina. The administration
of QLT091001 was shown to improve visual function as measured by Goldmann visual
ﬁeld, visual acuity and functional MRI; positive subjective observations were also reported
by patients [ 58]. QLT091001 entered a phase I trial enrolling 32 patients in 2009. The
authors claimed that non-invasive oral therapy is well tolerated, and it improved the visual
functions of LCA patients with RPE65 and LRAT defects. Scholl et al. used high-deﬁnition
optical coherence tomography and found a positive correlation of the photoreceptor layer’s
larger baseline OS thickness with treatment response prediction [61].
5.3. RNA-Based Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy: QR-110 (Sepofarsen)
Unlike LCA2 driven by the defective RPE65 enzyme, LCA10 is associated with splicing
defects in cilia transport protein CEP290. LCA10 patients’ CEP290 pre-mRNA contains a
hypomorphic cryptic splice site in intron 26 [ 62–65]. As a result, two CEP290 transcriptsInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 14 of 24
are produced: wild type transcripts are produced in parallel with alternatively spliced
transcripts containing an extra cryptic exon of 128 nucleotides that introduces a premature
stop codon (p.Cys998*). The c.2991 + 1655A > G allele’s hypomorphic nature results in
signiﬁcantly lower levels of functional CEP290, a key protein of the primary cilia [ 66–68].
Photoreceptors are particularly vulnerable to disruptions of cilia function [ 69]. QR-110 is
a single-stranded 20-O-methylated RNA antisense oligonucleotide that corrects splicing
defect arising from the CEP290 c.2991 + 1655A > G mutation. (Figure 3) QR-110 was shown
to restore the normal splicing of CEP290 in homozygous retinal organoids carrying the
CEP290 c.2991 + 1655A > G mutation and thus restore normal CEP290 mRNA and protein,
leading to increased ciliogenesis. Moreover, QR-110 was proven to be effective when used
on retinal organoids due to its good accessibility to the retina and good tolerance following
intravitreal (IVT) injection in humans [ 70]. QR-110 entered phase II in 2017, followed by
phase II/III in 2019. There were no serious adverse events, and visual acuity, self-reported
clarity and brightness in the treated eye were encouraging for the application of QR-110 in
LCA10 patients.
5.4. Gene Editing Therapy: EDIT-101
The collaborative effort of Allergan, Editas Medicine and the University of Florida
translated the very ﬁrst gene-editing approach to treat LCA10 to clinical trials in 2019. AGN-
151587 (EDIT-101) was designed to excise the pathogenic splice site, which would result in
the normal splicing and expression of CEP290 protein [ 71]. (Figure 3.) Another group using
a single AAV vector, Maeder et al., circumvented the limitation of the carrying capacity
of AAV by using a smaller Staphylococcus aureus CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 system that allowed an AAV5 vector to deliver the Cas9
gene and two guide RNAs [ 72] under the regulation of the GRK1 promoter that is speciﬁc to
photoreceptors only. Advance in preclinical study was shown as EDIT-101 performed gene
editing after its delivery to humanized CEP290 mice. Hence, in September 2019, EDIT-101
entered clinical trial phase I/II with 19 patients enrolled to evaluate single ascending dose
effects in participants with LCA10. To date, no study report has been published.
6. Limitations and Challenges
A comprehensive review of clinical trial reports brought to light numerous unmet
challenges of retinal viral gene therapy. These include the lack of a control vector to
distinguish the therapeutic effect between the vector and RPE65 re-establishment to ensure
that any improvements speciﬁcally reﬂect the expression of the protein encoded in the
AAV vector. Therapy complications generally do not arise from exposure to viral vectors
but rather from intervention with the subretinal administration. Furthermore, high patient
success variability and a lack of reliable baseline comparison within a small sample group
raise concerns on upgrading/reﬁning future development.
6.1. Surgical Complications
In 1969, Young and Bok identiﬁed that primate photoreceptors renew their OS within
two months [ 73]. In 1993, it was shown that the standard conﬁguration of the experimen-
tally detached retina returned to normal within 1 to 2 months [ 74], laying the foundations
for the use of the subretinal intervention. However, it was not until 2000 that Cooper and
Thomas consolidated the use of subretinal surgery techniques [ 75]. Due to the limited
target effect of intravitreal delivery in the posterior segment of the retina, only subretinal
delivery of vectors can ensure safe and efﬁcient transduction of photoreceptors and RPE
cells [ 6]. The most common AAV vectors do not efﬁciently target the outer retina follow-
ing intravitreal injection [ 76–79]. While most postoperative subretinal detachments are
reversible and subject to repair, several studies reported myriad surgical complications that
may result in macular hole development [ 48,54,60]. These common complications include
effusions, hypotonia, retinal tears, subconjunctival hemorrhage, ocular hyperemia and
increased intraocular pressure [52,60,80]. Bainbridge et al. devised a safer administration,Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 15 of 24
whereby up to 1mL of rAAV vector could be delivered through a single retinotomy without
causing tears in the thinned, degenerated retina [ 81]. With the complications delineated
above, subretinal injections are thus contraindicated in fragile and degenerating retinas,
signiﬁcantly limiting the population who may beneﬁt from the therapy. The demand for
intravitreal injection has ignited research on the directed evolution or design of speciﬁc
capsid mutations that may lead vectors to target the outer retina via intravitreal injec-
tion [ 82,83]. Furthermore, subretinal injection is a procedure that requires a surgical room
and general anesthesia that also possesses inherent risks. Surgical complications necessitate
the development of vectors that may target the outer retina via intravitreal injection, which
may also be performed at a clinic with local anesthesia.
6.2. Variability of Patient Response
Patient response to RPE65 gene therapy was shown to be variable within and be-
tween studies. Weleber et al. observed the gain of visual function in 9 out of 12 patients.
However, the individual visual function parameters that improved varied among these
patients, and two patients showed a decrease in BCVA in the treated eye compared to
the untreated eye [ 80]. In contrast to the successful stories exempliﬁed by Luxturna, the
trial (NCT00821340) testing the rAAV2-hRPE65 vector showed drastically different results.
Instead of improving visual acuity, post-treatment visual acuity decreased predictably due
to the temporal retinal detachment induced by subretinal administration and returned
to preoperative levels only by six months [ 48]. No clinically signiﬁcant improvement
was observed in any of the three patients, as determined by Goldmann perimetry testing,
microperimetry, or pattern electroretinography. The advertised advantage of RPE65 gene
therapy was the improvement of nystagmus; however, nystagmus in two patients who
suffered from high-amplitude nystagmus showed no resolution [ 48]. This was consistent
with a trial by Cideciyan, where it was reported that none of their patients demonstrated
decreases in nystagmus. Out of the three patients, visual function only improved in one
patient [ 48]. The varied patient response may be a consequence of a considerable variation
in baseline visual function and differences in vector administration site [80].
Analyzing the physiology behind it, Cideciyan proposed two hypotheses for slow
chromophore delivery rate: (i) reduced rate of synthesis and (ii) increased physical or
chemical barrier to its transport. The evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes:
(1) the dramatic accumulation of all-trans-retinyl ester (precursor of rhodopsin) in RPE,
(2) disorganized and unhealthy rod OS that aggravates the resistive barrier [ 46,84–86]
and (3) altered RPE/photoreceptor interface due to subretinal administration induced
retinal detachment [ 87]. The low expression of RPE65 despite successful retinal transfection
could reduce the rate of chromophore synthesis and act as an enzymatic limiting stage
to rhodopsin regeneration, as observed in mice engineered to express low levels of wild
type RPE65 . This enzymatic bottleneck must be circumvented with a vector that allows the
higher expression of RPE65 [88].
Furthermore, limitations of the small sample of patients are aggravated when the study
design does not involve the randomization of eyes, namely, clinicians tend to preferentially
treat patients with worse vision. Another bias arises when examiners are not masked
to the study eye versus control eye. The statistical approach was thus confounded by
numerous issues [ 60]. During the postoperative period, patients may have an inclination to
use the control eye and are unaware of visual gain in the treated eye, unless dictated to do
so [60]. An additional confounder arises from the presence of nystagmus and amblyopia.
These conditions would dictate the amount of time the eye can ﬁxate on a particular object
and is known to affect the degree of cortical activation that may induce false positive
improvements in LCA patients [ 89]. Lastly, the heterogeneity of disease progression and
the nature of RPE65 mutation should be evaluated and grouped on an individual basis for
relevant comparisons [60].Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 16 of 24
6.3. Readministration Safety
Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl was the ﬁrst randomized gene therapy trial for a genetic
disease to enter phase 3. Russel et al. stress that the current clinical trials that use an
uninjected contralateral eye as a control are not reﬂective of the clinical scenario where
bilateral administration would be given. Unilateral injection of therapeutics also does
not allow the relevant assessment of systemic effects [ 8]. Hence, Bennett et al. aimed
to address whether the readministration of virus-mediated gene delivery to the patients
exposed to priory delivery with the same vector may elicit immune responses that would
diminish the retinal improvements and visual function of the originally injected eye. An
intriguing observation revealed that the initially injected eye’s function improved after the
readministration into the second eye, as shown by fMRI. Surprisingly, the second treated
eyes had better clinical performance than the ﬁrst treated eye, despite being severely
damaged for more than 2.5 decades. After conﬁrmation by pupillometry, fMRI and full-
ﬁeld sensitivity testing, the second eye became more sensitive to dim light. A universal
phenomenon observed in numerous trials was that post-treatment retinal and cortical
responses did not show spontaneous recovery. Similar to experimental results in large
animals, the progression in retinal and cortical responses showed a continuous increase in
early stages and plateaued between 1.5 and 3 months postadministration [ 55]. Noteworthy,
after conﬁrming the therapeutic effects and safety in three adults who had received a
unilateral subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2 previously, Bennet et al. aimed to restore
vision in injected eyes and evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of the second injection in the
NCT01208389 trial [ 55]. As the AAV capsid and foreign RPE65 are potential antigens,
physicians were concerned that the readministration would result in an inﬂammatory
response upon re-exposure. Nevertheless, Bennet et al. demonstrated that readministration
was not accompanied by the potentially damaging immune response. The safety proﬁle of
readministration may be due to the eye’s immune-privilege nature and the small volume
of the ocular compartment that enables a low vector dosage [55].
6.4. Age-Dependent Outcome Controversy
Bennett et al. also observed that younger individuals tended to achieve better vision
recovery than older patients. However, these results may also reﬂect an age effect, whereby
the retina from younger patients had not undergone as much deterioration and toxin
buildup [ 55]. Nevertheless, Jacobson et al. argued that age did not signiﬁcantly affect
either the overall visual improvement parameters of the participants. Surprisingly, the
most dramatic visual acuity increases were observed in two older patients (aged 24 and
30). Jacobson et al. further addressed the reason behind the proposed trend as a matter of
emphasis. They believed a similar improvement in a child patient’s light sensitivity would
be emphasized over the same improvement in an adult patient. Similarly, the younger
patients’ mobility performance was studied uniocularly with lower room illuminations,
whereas the older patients were studied binocularly at 250 lux light level [ 60]. An ongoing
trial by Maguire et al. aimed to determine whether treatment efﬁcacy may be enhanced in
a population with amblyopia and retinal degeneration has not been concluded [48].
6.5. Inappropriate Clinical Markers
It is not clear whether the improvement in visual responses is entirely due to enhanced
levels of RPE65 in the retina. It is not safe and ethical to obtain evidence merely through
the biopsy of retinal material [ 5]. Some studies have demonstrated improved navigational
abilities using the newly injected eye [ 55]. Functional assays to study retinal function, such
as navigational abilities, were elaborated through trial and error. Ashtari et al. therein
pioneered using more objective parameters, such as psychophysical testing and fMRI
measurements, to study the responsiveness or activation of neurons in the visual cortex
that processes vision. Their study conﬁrmed that the gene augmentation therapy of
LCA2 patients rendered the retina (and visual cortex) activation more sensitive to dimmer
light and lower contrast stimuli [ 89]. Maguire et al. conﬁrmed an increase in visualInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 17 of 24
acuity post-treatment when comparing low levels of spatial vision to recovery levels that
were still low. The improvement of vision in dim light was patient self-reported and
not objectively quantiﬁed [ 48]. Since the clinical presentation, the hallmark of LCA is
nyctalopia, night blindness that makes navigation difﬁcult in dim light. Hence, the novel
outcome measure of functional vision based on assessing different degrees/Lux of light
levels and navigation accuracy, called the Multi-luminance Mobility Test (MLMT), was
proposed. The MLMT measures individuals’ navigating while avoiding obstacles at seven
standardized illumination levels with a pass or fail based on course navigation completed
within 180 s with three or fewer errors. Additionally, a positive score indicates passing the
MLMT at a lower light level.
6.6. Short Follow-Up and Small Sample Trial
Bennett et al. maintained a follow up of six months, but acknowledged the need for
longer follow up and a larger patient pool to determine safety and efﬁcacy measures and to
identify factors inﬂuencing the extent and duration of visual recovery [ 55]. To circumvent
the small sample size bias, Russell et al. designed a measurement method that allows
statistical high-power acquisition for a small trial. Using the MLMT framework to convert
various lighting conditions into a continuous metric provides the quantiﬁcation of the
continuous improvement [8].
6.7. Undeterred Onset of Photoreceptor Degeneration
Gene augmentation therapy for RPE65 deﬁciency using AAV2/2 vectors can improve
different aspects of sight in humans [ 5,48,52,80,90]. However, the central question in gene
therapy efﬁcacy is whether the disease progression can be halted. Progressive retinal
degeneration limits the efﬁcacy of retinal sensitivity in the long run, and the functional
improvements in photoreceptor cells found in animal models have been relatively mild in
humans [ 6,81,91]. Yet, subjective outcome measurements, such as visual acuity, Goldmann
perimetry, navigational vision and pupillometry, were reported to reveal improvements.
RPE65 protein expression in humans is greater than in dogs, indicating a greater demand
for RPE65 protein in the former. The balance between efﬁcacy and dosage-induced toxicity
limits the beneﬁts of current vectors [92]
Young RPE65-mutant dogs (4 months) were given interventions and then evaluated
5–11 years later. Minimal degenerative changes in the injection sites indicated that gene
therapy indeed halted degeneration progress. However, such beneﬁcial effects were not
observed in humans [ 93]. This raises questions as to whether variations in age, stage of
disease, species, mutations or complications cause the difference. Treatment in older age
may not prevent structural degeneration. Despite the uncertainties, phase I trials have
shown that gene therapy is safe, stable and restores partial retinal function [94].
7. CRISPR-Cas9 System Application in Inherited Retinal Dystrophies
Gene augmentation therapy through AAV-mediated gene delivery has shown promis-
ing therapeutic effects clinically; however, the stringent cargo limit of vectors narrows its
application to only a portion of cases with mutations in causative genes of relatively small
size [ 95]. Thus, approaches other than gene augmentation are in demand for a vast popula-
tion of IRD patients. CRISPR-Cas9 is emerging as a new gene-editing tool to address the
issue. The system utilizes guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to speciﬁc gene
loci proximal to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), inducing a double-strand break (DSB).
Cell machinery then repairs the CRISPR-targeted site by performing non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [96–98].
To date, retinal gene therapy approaches can be categorized into mutation depen-
dent and mutation independent. In the mutation-independent approach, all endogenous
chromosomal target genes, namely, both of the alleles, are ablated permanently by the
CRISPR-Cas9 technique, while exogenous wild type cDNA is supplemented to comple-
ment the gene loss. P23H and D190N are two common mutations in the rhodopsin ( RHO )Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 18 of 24
gene that result in the autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) [ 99]. Two separate
vectors, AAV-gRNA-mRho promoter-hRHO cDNA and AAV-Cas9, were mixed and subreti-
nally injected into a RhoP23H or RhoD190N mutation knock-in mouse model. The ablate
and supplement treatment caused an improvement in retinal outer nuclear layer thickness
and better preservation of a and b wave amplitude compared to the gene augmentation con-
trol only group [ 100]. Koji M. et al. proposed a system termed microhomology-mediated
end joining (MMEJ), with small microhomology arms of approximately 20 bps, MMEJ
allows the speciﬁc integration of complementary DNA into the desired genome loci via
a single AAV platform. Compared with dual vector-based mutation replacement, the
MMEJ system showed an improvement in genome editing efﬁcacy and thus showed robust
restoration of the visual function in retinal dystrophy mouse models [ 101]. The combination
of CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ or MMEJ that mediated mutant allele knockout and concomitant
delivery of the wild type cDNA that compensated for the loss of the endogenous target
gene combination has shown potency to correct mutations via AAV-mediated delivery.
In a mutation-dependent approach, dominant mutant genes in the heterozygous
pair of alleles responsible for the dysfunction can be selectively disrupted, while the
wild type allele gene should maintain its expression. Differentiation between wild type
and mutant alleles during Cas9 cleavage is achieved through the requirement of Cas9
activity upon recognizing PAM. Serine amino acid substitution at the 334/338 site results
in the dysfunction of rhodopsin protein and affects protein trafﬁcking to the photoreceptor
OS. The selective deletion of RhoS334in the rat model stopped the RHOS334production;
meanwhile, normal Rhocould be expressed dominantly [ 102]. Another example of mutant
knockout was demonstrated in the retina of RhoP23H heterozygous mice. Results showed
a reduced expression of mutant P23H transcript and improved thickness of photoreceptor
layers [103].
Though the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene therapy in several aspects,
the drawbacks are that CRISPR mandates highly allele-speciﬁc designs, while gene de-
fects underlying IRDs are extremely heterogeneous. Genetic heterogeneity has made the
development of IRD gene therapy prohibitive, as clinical trials are mandatory for every mu-
tation [ 104]. As a result, instead of manipulating the mutant genes, some studies turned to
targets that could be applied to a larger population, for example, the neural retina-speciﬁc
leucine zipper ( Nrl) gene. In RP disease progression, the loss of cone, which results in
blindness, is considered to be a secondary effect of rods degeneration. The Nrlgene is
a determinant in the development of rod photoreceptors, and it also plays a key role in
maintaining rod function and homeostasis in mature rod photoreceptors. Consequently,
the knockdown Nrlby AAV-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 in mice induced morphology and
functional changes in rods, allowing the cells to overcome the degeneration progress [ 105].
8. Conclusions and Future Initiatives
In summary, the evolution of gene therapy has overcome many barriers to achieve
translation from fundamental science advancements to clinical development and proved to
be relatively safe in multiple clinical trials, albeit with variations in outcomes. Among these
clinical trials, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) that targets RPE65 -associated LCA was
the ﬁrst FDA-approved gene therapy drug, while other clinical trials of IRDs, including
Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Choroideremia and X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP),
are also under way. In addition to Luxturna, three clinical trials advanced to Phase III
collectively, including antisense oligonucleotides-based QR-110 for LCA10, AAV5-RPRG
gene-drug for XLRP and AAV2-REP1 for choroideremia (Table 1). To date, clinical trials are
mostly gene augmentation therapies that deliver the correct gene to the retina to restore
its function. A few studies have taken advantage of antisense oligonucleotides to direct
the normal splicing of mutant pre-mRNA and thus correct the mutation on the mRNA
level. A gene editing strategy using the CRISPR-Cas9 system is utilized in correcting gene
aberrations by editing the pathogenic variants in a targeted fashion. Despite the advances
in IRD gene therapies, how to tackle IRDs presenting with early onset degeneration orInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 4534 19 of 24
causing aberrant retinal development is unsolved. In such cases, gene augmentation
intervention may be applied early, even in utero, raising ethical and practical challenges.
Furthermore, AAV-based gene therapy drawbacks include low transduction efﬁciency and
viral capsule immunogenic adverse effects; thus, proper dosage optimization is required to
ﬁnd a compromise between these two factors. Each RPE cell serves up to 40 photoreceptor
cells in the primate retina [ 106]; therefore, targeting RPE-speciﬁc mutations (such as RPE65 )
results in an ampliﬁed intervention effect and requires a lower dosage. On the other hand,
targeting photoreceptor-speciﬁc genes may require the optimization of vectors to increase
the tropism towards this cell type. As such, AAV8-based vectors can be more preferential
than AAV2-based vectors, as the former is more efﬁcient in transducing photoreceptors, to
date; the development of higher efﬁciency viral vectors may be required in the future [ 107].
