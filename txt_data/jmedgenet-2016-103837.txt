Background Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a
clinically and genetically heterogeneous set of disorders,for which diagnostic second-generation sequencing(next-generation sequencing, NGS) services have beendeveloped worldwide.
Methods We present the molecular ﬁndings of 537
individuals referred to a 105-gene diagnostic NGS testfor IRDs. We assess the diagnostic yield, the spectrum ofclinical referrals, the variant analysis burden and thegenetic heterogeneity of IRD. We retrospectively analysedisease-causing variants, including an assessment ofvariant frequency in Exome Aggregation Consortium(ExAC).Results Individuals were referred from 10 clinically
distinct classi ﬁcations of IRD. Of the 4542 variants
clinically analysed, we have reported 402 mutations as acause or a potential cause of disease in 62 of the 105genes surveyed. These variants account or likely accountfor the clinical diagnosis of IRD in 51% of the 537referred individuals. 144 potentially disease-causingmutations were identi ﬁed as novel at the time of clinical
analysis, and we further demonstrate the segregation ofknown disease-causing variants among individuals withIRD. We show that clinically analysed variants indicatedas rare in dbSNP and the Exome Variant Server remainrare in ExAC, and that genes discovered as a cause ofIRD in the post-NGS era are rare causes of IRD in apopulation of clinically surveyed individuals.Conclusions Ourﬁndings illustrate the continued
powerful utility of custom-gene panel diagnostic NGStests for IRD in the clinic, but suggest clear futureavenues for increasing diagnostic yields.
INTRODUCTION
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a diverse set of
Mendelian disorders that are a major cause ofinherited blindness across the world. They arecaused by the progressive deterioration or the earlyloss of cells fundamental for the normal functionof the retina,
1the component of the eye respon-
sible for converting light energy into electricalsignals.
IRDs are clinically heterogeneous and vary
widely in their severity, age of onset, pathogenesis,manner of disease progression and inheritancepattern. IRDs distinguishable through clinical andelectrophysiological investigation include: rod-conedystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa (RCD/RP); conedystrophy (CD); cone-rod dystrophy (CRD);
macular dystrophy and Stargardt disease (MD/STGD); early-onset retinal disease and Leber con-genital amaurosis (EORD/LCA); congenital station-ary night blindness (CSNB); and familial exudativevitreo-retinopathy. Notably, IRD can be a feature of
a multisystem disorder such as Usher syndrome,
Bardet –Biedl syndrome (BBS), Senior –Loken syn-
drome and Joubert syndrome.
Decades of research have elucidated the genetic
basis of IRD, revealing a suite of mutations in over200 genes.
2The genes associated with IRDs can be
involved in a variety of processes and functions,3
and their tissue expression can range from exclusiveexpression in the retina to ubiquitous expressionacross the body. IRDs are predominantly mono-genic but a range of inheritance patterns have beendescribed, including: autosomal-dominant,autosomal-recessive, X-linked, digenic and mito-chondrial inheritance.
The identi ﬁcation of the genetic basis of IRD can
greatly assist the clinical diagnosis, counselling,treatment and management received on apatient-by-patient basis. Since the inception ofsecond-generation DNA sequencing technologies(commonly referred to as next-generation sequen-cing, NGS) —techniques permitting the surveillance
of genetic variation within multiple genes througha single experiment
4—many clinical laboratories
have adopted NGS as a tool for the diagnosis ofrare genetic diseases,
5–7including IRD.89W e pre-
viously described a custom-gene panel NGS diag-nostic service for individuals with IRD.
10This
follow-up report outlines the success of this 105gene diagnostic test for the ﬁrst 537 individuals
with IRD referred from worldwide institutions anddescribes 131 new mutations in 45 genes as apotential cause of disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient referrals
Patient referrals were made from worldwide clinical
institutions. There were no speci ﬁc requirements
for clinical phenotypic descriptions of IRD beforediagnostic genomic testing was undertaken,although the reason for referral was requested. Allexperiments had been approved by the GreaterManchester W est Research Ethics Committee andwere performed in a UK Accreditation ServiceClinical Pathology Accredited Medical Laboratory.

DNA samples were enriched for the coding regions ±50 bp of
105 genes (see online supplementary table S1) and a speci ﬁed
intronic region of the CEP290 gene, using an Agilent SureSelect
Custom Design target-enrichment kit (Agilent, Santa Clara,California, USA). DNA samples were indexed with a uniquepaired-end barcode and then subjected to multiplexed high-throughput parallel sequencing using either the ABI SOLiD5500 platform (n=235; Life T echnologies, Carlsbad, California,USA) or the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 (n=302; Illumina, SanDiego, California, USA), following manufacturer ’s protocols.
Variant calling
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and aligned to the hg19 ref-
erence genome before duplicate read removal and variant callingwas performed. For ABI SOLiD sequencing reads, demultiplexing,alignment and variant calling were all performed using LifescopeGenomic Analysis software. For Illumina HiSeq sequencing reads,demultiplexing was performed using CASA V A V .1.8.2. (Illumina),
alignment was performed using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner shortread (BW A-short V .0.6.2) software,
11and variant calling was per-
formed using the Uni ﬁedGenotyper12within the Genome Analysis
To ol K i t13(GATK-lite V .2.0.39), after base quality score recalibra-
tion and indel realignment. T o reduce the number of potential false-positive variants from NGS, we primarily limited the clinical ana-lysis of genomic variants to those with sequencing quality metricsabove speci ﬁc criteria. These metrics were calculated as a result of
pilot and control sample analyses, which have been previously pub-lished.
10 14For the ABI SOLiD, we considered single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs) with ≥18× sequencing depth and a minimum
mean quality value (MQV) >18, and considered indels withsupport from >5× independent sequencing reads. For the IlluminaHiSeq, we considered SNVs with ≥50× independent sequencing
reads and ≥45 MQV , and considered indels with support from
>25% of the aligned and independent sequencing reads.
Variant interpretation
A summary of our strategy to clinically interpret genetic variantsis provided in online supplementary table S2. Clinical interpret-ation was restricted to variants within coding regions ±5 bp ofthe 105 genes included in online supplementary table S1 and anintronic variant, c.2991+1655A>G, in the CEP290 gene. W e
considered variants with a frequency >1% in control popula-tion databases (Exome Variant Server, ESP-6500; dbSNP V .135)as benign polymorphisms, providing the cohort size was suf ﬁ-
ciently large and diverse, and the sequencing read depthexceeded an average of 18× in the Exome Variant Server (EVS).Variants with a frequency below 1% in SNP databases but witha high recurrence rate in-house were classi ﬁed as neutral or
proven to be NGS run artefacts by Sanger sequencing. Thepathogenicity of the remaining genetic variants was determinedthrough extensive appraisal of the variant ’s predicted conse-
quence (annotations performed against the Ensembl V .68 data-
base), the scienti ﬁc literature, the patient ’s clinical referral
(genotype –phenotype correlations) and in silico modelling
including SIFT
15and PolyPhen-2.16These criteria for variant
interpretation are consistent with the guidelines recently out-lined by the American College of Medical Genetics.

Clinical decision making
A con ﬁrmed molecular diagnosis was provided for individuals
with variants determined as ‘clearly pathogenic ’or‘likely patho-
genic ’(see online supplementary table S2) in a disease-causingstate (eg, homozygous or compound heterozygous in a gene
known to cause recessive IRD). A provisional molecular diagno-sis was reported for individuals with ‘variants of unknown clin-
ical signi ﬁcance ’(see online supplementary table S2) that were
found in a disease-causing state (eg, compound heterozygous
with another ‘clearly pathogenic ’variant in a gene known to
cause recessive IRD). If ‘clearly pathogenic ’or‘likely patho-
genic ’variants were identi ﬁed in more than one gene in a
disease-causing state the family history, phenotypic presentationand evidence for variant pathogenicity was discussed in detailwithin a clinical multidisciplinary team meeting. Variants deter-mined as ‘clearly pathogenic ’or‘likely pathogenic ’in a carrier
state (eg, heterozygous in a gene known to cause recessive IRD)were clinically reported as carrier ﬁndings. Cascade testing was
offered for relevant family members to assist with the interpret-ation of variant pathogenicity and to clarify the risks to add-itional family members.
Variant validation
W e performed PCR and bidirectional capillary sequencing toconﬁrm the zygosity and the presence of disease-causing and
carrier variants before they were clinically reported.
Retrospective variant analysis
All clinically analysed SNVs were also retrospectively comparedwith the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database inOctober 2015 to determine their frequency within a large andethnically diverse population data set. Novel and potentiallydisease-causing variants, absent from the literature at the time ofclinical analysis, were retrospectively compared with the HumanGene Mutation Database, HGMD ,
18in October 2015. Mutated
genes determined to account for molecular diagnoses were com-pared with their dates of discovery, available in the RetNetdatabase.

RESULTS
Clinical detailsDemographics and classi ﬁcations
W e performed diagnostic NGS testing for 537 patients (287
males and 250 females) referred with clinical indications ofIRD. All of the 537 individuals were initially referred on asingleton basis.
Phenotype classi ﬁcation
IRDs have a diverse spectrum of overlapping clinical presenta-
tion, which can vary by age of onset, extent of visual impair-ment, nature of disease progression and involvement ofadditional clinical features. W e grouped all referred patients into10 distinct clinical classi ﬁcations (see online supplementary table
S3). The most common referral was non-syndromic RCD/RP(n=250). The most common referral of syndromic disease wasUsher syndrome (n=38), a disorder characterised by neurosen-sory hearing loss and visual impairment. There were eight casesof suspected syndromic ciliopathies referred, including sevencases of BBS.
Molecular results
Sequencing statistics
A total of 2 089 243 343 aligned, ontarget and unique sequen-
cing reads were generated by NGS. For the 235 patients ana-lysed through ABI SOLiD sequencing, an average of 6 537 522aligned, ontarget and unique sequencing reads were generatedfor each patient. For the 302 patients analysed through IlluminaHiSeq sequencing, an average of 1 830 879 aligned, ontarget

The diagnostic assay achieved an average coverage at ≥20× for
98.4% and at ≥50× for 97.3% of the region clinically analysed
for the 537 referred patients (see online supplementary ﬁgure
S1). Sequencing data generated through the Illumina HiSeq
covered signi ﬁcantly more of the clinically analysed region than
sequencing data generated through the ABI SOLiD at ≥20×
coverage (see online supplementary ﬁgure S1; HiSeq=99.0
±0.01%, SOLiD=97.6±0.05%, p<0.0001) and ≥50× cover-
age (see online supplementary ﬁgure S1; HiSeq=98.3±0.03%,
SOLiD=95.9±0.09%, p<0.0001).
Variant analysis burden
A total of 143 675 variants were initially identi ﬁed in the 537
patients ( table 1 ). Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we ﬁltered
the variants for their quality and frequency in control popula-tions. This restricted the number of variants for analysis to4542, an average of 8.4 variants per referred individual. Mostof the clinically analysed variants were single-nucleotide altera-tions (SNVs), with an average of 8.1 per patient. HeterozygousSNVs provided the largest burden for analysis, with 4172detected (an average of 7.8 per patient), but only 6% (n=252)reported as a cause of disease after extensive clinical analysis
(table 1 ). There were 2266 unique SNVs clinically analysed,
with 574 identi ﬁed in more than 1 individual. An indel event
was clinically analysed, on average, in a third of the referredpatients.
At the time of analysis, 30% of SNVs (1311/4358) and 71%
of indels (131/184) were neither present in dbSNP or in EVS.This included 811 missense variants, 70 nonsense variants, 105coding region indel events, 26 splice region indel events, 350synonymous variants, 2 start codon variants, 32 canonical splicesite variants and 46 splice region variants (novel; ﬁgure 1 ). W e
clinically analysed 135 deletion events (105 heterozygous and30 homozygous), 48 insertion events (46 heterozygous and 2homozygous) and 1 heterozygous deletion –insertion event.
Eighty percent (147/184) of the indel events were present in thecoding regions of genes, and 110 of these were expected tocause premature termination of the protein product (84heterozygous and 26 homozygous). A small number of clinically
analysed variants were determined as false positives after ana-lysis through PCR and bidirectional capillary sequencing techni-ques (see online supplementary table S4).
Clinical decision making
W e identi ﬁed a molecular diagnosis for 271 of the 537 referred
patients (51%). The molecular ﬁndings underpinning these diag-
noses are reported in online supplementary table S5. W e haveprovided a molecular diagnosis for recessive IRD in 208 cases(homozygous, n=88; compound heterozygous, n=120), domin-ant IRD in 50 cases and X-linked IRD in 13 cases. W e found noclear instances of digenic or polygenic inheritance. W e informedclinicians of 154 individuals who carry ‘clearly pathogenic ’or
‘likely pathogenic ’variants in a carrier state, that is, heterozy-
gous in a gene known to underpin disease inherited in a reces-sive manner, 59 of whom received a molecular diagnosis afterthe identi ﬁcation of ‘clearly pathogenic ’or‘likely pathogenic ’
variants in other disease-causing genes (dominant IRD, n=11;recessive IRD, n=48). Eighty families were referred for cascadetesting after receiving molecular results from NGS testing forthe referred proband. W e con ﬁrmed compound heterozygous
variants to be in-trans in 36 cases, con ﬁrmed homozygosity in
11 cases, identi ﬁed de novo variants in 3 cases and identi ﬁed 16
cases of additional variant segregation with IRD. In a singlecase, we identi ﬁed heterozygous variants underpinning a provi-
sional molecular diagnosis to be in-cis , altering the counselling
that was received by the referred individual.
Several individuals were found to have ‘clearly pathogenic ’or
‘likely pathogenic ’variants in a disease-causing state that would
not be expected to cause the IRD subtype declared by the refer-ring clinician (see online supplementary table S6). For example,two individuals referred with clinical indications of RP werefound to have ‘likely pathogenic ’mutations in the CHM gene, a
cause of choroideremia. These genomic ﬁndings led to the
re-evaluation of initial clinical descriptions, and in some cases
reﬁned or altered the initial clinical diagnosis. In a single case
(13005797; online supplementary table S5), bidirectional capil-lary sequencing targeted at a region of GUCY2D , which had
been poorly covered through NGS (460 nucleotides of a codingexon with <50× coverage) identi ﬁed a novel heterozygous mis-
sense variant, c.380C>T p.(Pro127Arg), that had not beenidenti ﬁed through diagnostic NGS. This large protein-coding
exon of GUCY2D (chr17:7906361 –7907091) has a GC content
of 76.20%. Homozygous and compound heterozygous muta-tions in GUCY2D are known to cause EORD/LCA.
19When
considered in combination with a heterozygous frameshift muta-tion in GUCY2D , c.2595delG, the identi ﬁed missense variant
was concluded to likely account for a molecular diagnosis ofautosomal-recessive EORD/LCA.
Genetic heterogeneity
In total, 402 genetic variants are reported to account for amolecular diagnosis of IRD (273 variants with a single occur-rence and 38 variants reported multiple times). Variantsreported in multiple individuals ranged from presence in 2(n=22) to 11 patients (n=1). The most commonly reportedvariant is CERKL c.375C>G p.(Cys125T rp), which is reported
to coincide with clinical presentations of IRD from four diseasesubgroups: one case of CD; three cases of CRD; four cases ofRCD/RP and three cases of MD/STGD.
Variants accounting for a molecular diagnosis of IRD were
found in 62 of the 105 genes included in the diagnostic NGSassay ( ﬁgure 2 ). Most of the genes with disease-causing variantsTable 1 The total number of genetic variants found during the

supplementary table S7; 66%, n=41), the most frequent ofwhich are mutations causing recessively inherited RCD/RP intheEYSgene (n patients=7) and dominantly inherited RCD/RP
in the RHO gene (n patients=6). The remaining 21 genes are
reported with pathogenic variants in patients referred from twoor more disease referral categories (see online supplementarytable S7). The gene associated with the most highly variablephenotype is ABCA4 , which was concluded to contain patho-
genic variants causing IRD in 23 patients referred from ﬁve dis-
crete referral categories, including: 12 patients with MD/STGD;5 with CRD; 4 with RCD/RP and 1 individual with CD.Disruption of the ABCA4 gene was also concluded to be the
cause of visual impairment in a single patient referred withUsher syndrome but is not expected to contribute to the clinicalpresentation of hearing loss.
Mutation consequences
W e determined 311 unique mutations to be the cause of disease.These included 137 missense variants, 20 canonical splice sitevariants, 76 nonsense variants, 54 out-of-frame insertion ordeletion events, 1 variant disrupting the start codon, 6 syn-onymous variants, 9 splice region variants, 1 intronic variantand 7 inframe deletions. Fifty-two percent (162/311) of thevariants reported to account for a molecular diagnosis wereneither present in dbSNP or EVS. Speci ﬁcally, 71% (97/137) of
the clinically reported missense variants, 55% (42/76) of clinic-ally reported nonsense SNVs and 63% (34/54) of clinicallyreported out-of-frame indel events were neither present indbSNP or EVS.
Of the 137 clinically reported missense variants, 30 had func-
tional support of their disruption to the encoded protein, 49 haddisease segregation evidence in the literature without functionalsupport, 6 had evidence for an alternative amino acid substitu-tion at the same residue as a cause of disease and 52 were deter-mined as a novel cause of disease (see online supplementary tableS8). One hundred and thirty clinically reported variants areexpected to cause premature termination during protein synthe-sis, 76 of these are SNVs and 54 are out-of-frame small insertionor deletion events. Fifty-one percent (66/130) of theseloss-of-protein-function events were determined as novel causesof disease; this included 35 nonsense SNVs and 31 small indels(see online supplementary table S8).Retrospective variant analysis
The average allele frequency in ExAC of the 2266 unique clinic-ally analysed SNVs was 0.12; however, 12% (517/4358) of allclinically analysed SNVs were found to be at a greater frequencythan 1% in the ExAC database. The average allele frequency inExAC of variants clinically reported as a cause of disease was0.02 (median=0 and max=0.78).
One hundred and forty-four variants were determined as
novel causes of disease at the time of clinical analysis.Ninety-one percent (131/144) of these variants remained novelcauses of disease after comparison with the HGMD in October2015. This included 46 missense variants, 12 canonical splicesite variants, 33 nonsense variants, 28 out-of-frame insertion ordeletion events, 4 synonymous variants, 5 splice region variantsand 3 inframe deletions. All of these variants are reported inonline supplementary table S8 and have been submitted to theClinVar database.
Sixty- ﬁve of the 105 genes surveyed (62%) were identi ﬁed
between 1995 and 2004, and mutations in these genesaccounted for a molecular diagnosis in 214 of the 271 cases(79%; ﬁgure 3 ). This equates to a rate of 3.3 diagnoses per gene
analysed. In contrast, the 33 genes included in our analysis that
were identi ﬁed post-2005 only accounted for 41 of the 271
molecular diagnoses (15%; ﬁgure 3 ), a rate of 1.2 diagnoses per
gene analysed.
DISCUSSION
Developments in DNA sequencing technology have enabled thetransition from single gene and known mutation diagnosticassays to comprehensive surveys of variation within all genesknown to cause disease phenotypes. This has shifted the diag-nostics bottleneck from the detection of disease-causing vari-ation to the clinical interpretation of the plethora of geneticvariants identi ﬁed. Here, we discuss the molecular ﬁndings from
a NGS diagnostic test that has been employed in a clinicalcontext to survey genes known to be associated with IRD, aclinically and genetically heterogeneous set of Mendelian disor-ders that affect millions of individuals worldwide.

diagnostic testing, including 208 autosomal-recessive, 50autosomal-dominant and 13 X-linked recessive cases. Otherstudies employing NGS have shown higher molecular diagnosticrates than reported in this study, including Eisenberger and col-leagues,
21Zhao and colleagues22and the Saudi Mendeliome
group.23W e attribute differences in diagnostic success rates to a
number of factors. First, the diagnostic service is provisioned forworldwide referral institutions on a singleton basis and there areno prespeci ﬁed criteria for the clinical phenotyping of referred
individuals. Detailed clinical phenotyping in complement togenomic analysis has been shown to discover and acceleratediagnoses in the clinic.
24 25Second, the 105 gene enrichment
does not include all genes that are now known as a cause ofIRD, and application of whole exome sequencing (WES) orwhole genome sequencing (WGS) techniques to individualswithout a molecular diagnosis has identi ﬁed variants in other
genes as a cause of disease, for example, mutations in IQCB1
identi ﬁed through WES.
26It is of note that we have recently
expanded the diagnostic service to include an additional 71genes and pathogenic intronic variants associated with IRD.This expansion intends to meet the clinical need for the surveil-lance of genes known to underpin CSNB. Third, there weretechnical limitations with early versions of the diagnosticservice, for example, insuf ﬁcient coverage achieved by the ABI
SOLiD sequencing platform over all 288 087 DNA bases whichare clinically surveyed (see online supplementary ﬁgure S1).
The use of NGS in the clinic has drastically increased the
diagnostic yields routinely achieved for IRD. However, therestill remains an inability to clinically survey the ﬁnal AG-rich
exon of RPGR (orf15) through the NGS techniques described in
this study and by others. Mutations in RPGR orf15 are well
documented as a major cause of X-linked RP ,
27but bidirectional
capillary sequencing techniques remain the gold standard clin-ical screening tool for this region of the genome.

informatics techniques. Such techniques have evolved with theclinical requirements of diagnostic services. Validation of bio-informatics techniques to detect complex insertion and deletionevents, for example, Pindel,
29and complete exon deletions and
duplications, for example, ExomeDepth,30will undoubtedly
increase the diagnostic yields described in this study, and inothers. Finally, the expansion of analyses to non-coding andregulatory regions of known disease-causing genes will increasediagnostic yields for IRD. W e observed an interesting trend inour cohort of predominantly W estern European and SouthAsian individuals, which suggests that newly identi ﬁed genes are
becoming increasingly rarer causes of disease ( ﬁgure 3 ). The
striking observation that 79% of cases with molecular diagnosesare accounted for by mutations in genes discovered between1995 and 2004 suggests that while the continued addition ofnew disease-causing genes will of course improve diagnostic ser-vices, the comprehensive evaluation of protein-coding and regu-latory variants affecting known disease-causing genes may havea greater in ﬂuence on diagnostic yield. For example, the
genomic sequencing of genes known to cause IRD has identi ﬁed
large deletions,
14deeply intronic disease-causing mutations31
and variants in regulatory regions,32which would elude trad-
itional custom panel NGS analysis.
A signi ﬁcant complication of implementing NGS as a diagnos-
tic service is the number of variants, which require clinicalinterpretation on a patient-by-patient basis ( table 1 ), many of
which have not previously been de ﬁned in control populations
(ﬁgure 1 ). However, a clear advantage of NGS diagnostic
approaches over other high-throughput techniques is the cap-ability to detect novel disease-causing variation,
33deﬁned as var-
iants that have not previously been reported as disease causingin the literature or in the HGMD. W e have reported 144 noveldisease-causing variants as a possible cause of IRD (see onlinesupplementary table S8). Thirteen of these variants determinedas novel at the time of clinical analysis have since been describedas disease causing in other studies, for example, USH2A
c.11713C>T p.(Arg3905Cys)
34and PRPF31 c.1060C>T p.
(Arg354T er).35Many of the reported novel variants are
expected to cause disruption of normal translation, including 35nonsense variants, 6 disruptions of canonical splice sites and 31out-of-frame coding indels. Most novel variants are clinicallyreported on a single occasion; however, some are reported tocause disease in multiple individuals, for example, CERKL
c.193G>T p.(Glu65T er) in ﬁve individuals and EYS
c.1155T>A p.(Cys385T er) in three individuals. None of thenovel missense variants, splice region variants or inframe indelsreported in this study are determined to cause disease on mul-tiple occasions, and further disease segregation and/or func-tional study will greatly assist their clinical interpretation.
In summary, we illustrate the powerful clinical utility of a
diagnostic NGS test for individuals with inherited visual impair-ment. W e add to evidence of known pathogenic mutationsthrough further correlation in individuals who present with clin-ical indications of IRD (see online supplementary table S5) andoutline 131 novel disease-causing variants that are not previ-ously described in individuals with IRD.
