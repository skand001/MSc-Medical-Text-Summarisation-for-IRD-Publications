Inherited	 retinal	diseases	 (IRD)	are	genotypically	 and	phenotypically	 varied	disorders	 that	lead	to	
progressive degeneration of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) eventually resulting 
in	severe	vision	loss.	Recent	research	 and	developments	 in	gene	therapy	 and	cell	therapy	 have	shown	
therapeutic	 promise	 in	these	hitherto	 incurable	 diseases.	 In	gene	therapy,	 copies	of	a	healthy	gene	are	
introduced	 into	the	host	cells	via	a	viral	vector.	Clinical	 trials	for	several	genes	are	underway	 while	
treatment for RPE65	called	voretigene	 neparvovec,	 is	already	approved	 and	commercially	 available.	 Cell	
therapy	 involves	 the	introduction	 of	stem	cells	that	can	replace	degenerated	 cells.	These	therapies	 are	
delivered	 to	the	target	tissues,	namely	the	photoreceptors	 (PR)	and	RPE	via	subretinal,	 intravitreal,	 or	
suprachoroidal	 delivery	 systems.	 Although	 there	are	several	limitations	 to	these	therapies,	 they	are	expected 	
to	slow	the	disease	progression	 and	restore	some	visual	functions.	 Further	advances	 such	as	gene	editing	
technologies	 are	likely	to	result	in	more	precise	and	personalized	 treatments.	 Currently,	 several	IRDs	such	
as	retinitis	pigmentosa,	 Stargardt	 disease,	Leber	congenital	 amaurosis,	 choroideremia,	 achromatopsia,	 and	
Usher	syndrome	 are	being	evaluated	 for	possible	 gene	therapy	or	cell	therapy.	 It	is	important	 to	encourage	
patients	 to	undergo	 gene	testing	and	maintain	 a	nationwide	 registry	 of	IRDs.	This	article	provides	 an	
overview	 of	the	basics	of	these	therapies	 and	their	current	status.

Accepted:	 20‑Mar‑2022	 Published:	 30‑Jun‑2022Retinal dystrophies or inherited retinal diseases  (IRD) are 
a	group	of	heterogeneous	 diseases	 that	are	characterized 	
by	progressive	 photoreceptor	 (PR)	and/retinal	 pigment 	
epithelium	 (RPE)	cell	loss	and	eventual	 atrophy	 of	retinal	
tissue.	They	are	a	significant	 cause	of	blindness	 worldwide.	
The	common	 IRDs	include	retinitis	pigmentosa	 (RP),	Stargardt

The	management	 of	IRDs	has	conventionally	 been	limited	
to	genetic	counseling	 and	low‑vision	 rehabilitation.	 However,	
with	the	recent	surge	in	research	 into	gene	therapy,	 stem	cell	
therapy,	 and	retinal	prosthesis,	 several	treatment	 options	are	on	
the	horizon.	 The	management	 of	IRDs	with	gene	therapy	has	
been	of	interest	since	the	discovery	 that	biological	 information	
is	passed	on	from	one	generation	 to	the	other	by	discrete	
biological	 material	 called	“genes”	 encoded	 in	the	DNA	of	the	
cell	and	that	mutations	 in	various	genes	are	responsible	 for	
the	occurrence	 of	IRDs.	Cell	replacement	 therapy	 is	another	
strategy	 to	replace	dead	or	damaged	 retinal	cells	with	cells	
derived	from	different	 sources	including	 mesenchymal 	
stem	cells,	peripheral	 or	fetal	RPE	cells,	human	embryonic 	stem	cells	(hESCs),	 or	human‑induced	 pluripotent	 stem	
cells	(hiPSCs).

therapy	and	their	current	status	in	the	management	 of	retinal	
dystrophies.
Gene Therapy
Basics
The majority of genes mutated in RP	encode	proteins	 that	
are	expressed	 either	in	PR	cells	or	in	the	RPE.[1] Gene therapy 
involves	gene	supplementation/replacement	 or	gene	silencing. 	
Classic	gene	therapy	consists	of	gene	supplementation,	 which	
enables	 the	restoration	 of	defective	 gene	function	 or	the	
supply	of	a	missing	 gene	by	introducing	 a	functional	 copy	
of	the	gene	to	target	cells.	This	is	employed	 for	disorders	 due	
to	loss‑of‑function	 mutations	 and	is	based	on	the	delivery	
of	a	correct	copy	of	the	defective	 gene	without	removal 	
of	the	endogenous 	mutant	 one.	Gene	silencing	 inhibits	
the	expression	 of	the	mutated	 gene	via	the	modification 	
of	messenger	 RNA	(mRNA)	 and	is	applied	 to	disorders 	
caused	by	gain‑of‑function	 mutations.[1]	Irrespective	 of	
mutation‑dependent	 and	‑independent	 strategies,	 vectors	are

Battu, et al.: Update on cell and gene therapy for IRDs
the	key	for	successful	 gene	therapy.[2]	Gene	therapy,	 therefore,	
uses	either	a	viral	or	non‑viral	 vector	that	replaces	 or	silences	
the	causative	gene.
Vectors
Viruses	are	obligate	 parasites	 of	cells	with	specific	tropism	
for	the	cell	type	and	have	an	efficient	 delivery	 system	for	the	
transfer	of	genetic	material.	 Decades	 of	research	 have	helped	in	
the	development	 of	safe	and	efficient	viral	vectors	suitable	for	
the delivery of the genes in vivo.	Retroviruses,	 adenoviruses,	
adeno‑associated	 viruses,	 herpes	simplex	 viruses,	 and	more	
recently	 with	the	advent	of	nanotechnology,	 nonviral	 gene	
delivery	systems	are	being	considered	for	gene	therapy.[1,2]
Adeno‑associated 	viruses	(AAV)	have	become	a	very	popular	
choice	for	the	gene	therapy	 delivery	 system.[3]	AAV	vector	
presents	 specific	characteristics	 such	as	low	immunogenicity	
and	toxicity,	 lack	of	pathogenicity,	 long‑term	 transgene 	
expression,	 and	relative	 ease	in	manipulating	 genetic	
elements,	 making	 them	the	safest	and	most	effective	 viral	
vector	platform	 for	gene	delivery	 into	the	retina	to	date.	They	
are	replication‑deficient	 in	their	wild‑type	 condition.	 They	
need	infection	 of	another	 virus,	for	example,	 adenovirus 	
(and	hence	the	name	AAV)	or	DNA	damage	insult	to	undergo	
a	lytic	cycle	in	the	host	cell.	A	variety	of	clinical	trials	have	
been	initiated	 worldwide	 using	different	 serotypes	 of	AAV	
for	various	IRDs.	Depending	 on	the	capsid	protein	expressed,	
several	serotypes 	of	the	AAV	virus	have	been	identified,	 among	
which	AAV2	is	the	most	studied.	 These	capsid	proteins	 allow	
the	AAV	to	infect	a	specific	cell	type,	thus	making	the in vivo 
cell‑type	specificity	possible.
Two major limitations of AAVs in the retina are their slow 
onset	of	transgene	 expression	 and	the	vector’s	limited	cargo	
capacity	 of	4.7	kb.[4]	Certain	forms	of	IRDs	such	as	Stargardt	
disease,	 Usher	syndrome	 Type	1B	and	LCA10	are	caused	by	
mutations in ABCA4, MYO7A ,	and	CEP290,	respectively	 that	
have	cDNA	that	exceeds	5	kb,	and	these	are	difficult	 to	treat	
with AAV.[4]
Lentiviruses	 (LVs)	have	a	large	capacity	 of	transgenes,	 and	
sequences	 up	to	8	kb	can	be	integrated	 into	chromosomes	 of	
target	cells,	supporting	 long‑term	 expression.	 Drawbacks	 of	
LVs	are	potential	 insertional	 mutagenesis,	 the	complexity	 of	
production,	and	the	large	diameter.[5]
Nonviral	 vectors	using	a	nanomaterial‑based 	delivery 	
system,	 lipid‑based	 delivery,	 and	more	recently	 magnetic 	
nanoparticles 	are	being	tried.	Challenges 	for	these	systems	
include	 difficulty	 in	delivery,	 instability,	 and	short‑term 	
transient expression.[2]
To	overcome	 some	of	the	limitations	 of	gene	therapy, 	
genome	 editing	 technologies	 have	gained	considerable 	
interest.	Genome	 editing	using	clustered	 regularly	 interspaced 	
short	palindromic	 repeats	(CRISPR)	 and	CRISPR‑associated 	
protein	(Cas)	have	provided	 an	accurate	 and	efficient	 way	to	
edit	the	human	genome.	 The	system	utilizes	guide	RNA	to	
direct	Cas9	endonuclease	 to	specific	gene	loci	proximal	 to	a	
protospacer	 adjacent	motif,	inducing	 a	double‑strand	 break.	Cell	
machinery	 then	repairs	the	CRISPR‑targeted	 site	by	performing 	
non‑homologous	end‑joining	or	homology‑directed	repair.[6]
There	are	two	different	 approaches	 to	genome	 editing:	an 
in vivo approach	 where	the	disease‑causing	 mutations	 are	corrected	 directly	in	the	retina	and	an	ex vivo	approach	 in	
which	the	mutation	 is	corrected	 in	the	patient’s	 cells	and	the	
autologous	cells	then	used	for	cell	transplantation.[7]
Treatment	 of	autosomal	 dominant	 disorders	 is	challenging	
because	 specific	inactivation	 of	the	mutant	allele	is	required	
to	restore	the	phenotype,	 and	gene	augmentation	 approaches	
do	not	directly	 target	the	pathogenic 	gene.	One	promising 	
therapeutic	 approach	 using	CRISPR	technology	 is	to	decrease	
gene	transcription	 through	 a	strategy	 known	as	CRISPR	
interference	 (CRISPRi).[8]	Ablation	 of	the	mutant	allele	using	
the	CRISPR/Cas9	 technology	 is	another	strategy	 that	has	been	
used in dominant forms for RP due to mutations in the gene 
encoding	 rhodopsin.[9,10] These studies demonstrate the use 
of	CRISPR/Cas	 systems	 to	inactivate	 autosomal	 dominant 	
pathogenic	alleles.[7]
Diseases Treated
Gene therapy for LCA
Leber	congenital	 amaurosis	 (LCA)	is	an	infantile,	 autosomal	
recessive	 variant	of	RP	that	was	first	described	 by	Leber	in	
1869.	To	date,	mutations	 in	25	genes	currently	 associated 	
with	LCA	have	been	identified.	 The	most	common	 mutations	
include	 CEP290 (15%),	GUCY2D  (12%),	CRB1 (10%),	and	
RPE65 (6%).[11,12]
RPE65 is	a	gene‑encoding	 retinoid	 isomerohydrolase 	
expressed	 in	the	RPE	that	plays	a	key	role	in	the	visual	cycle.	
Defective	 RPE65  gene leads to an early onset of degeneration of 
rods,	followed	 by	cones,	causing	significant	 visual	loss.	This	leads	
to	RP	type	20	and	LCA	type	2,	both	of	which	have	been	extensively 	
evaluated.[13,14]	Following	 success	in	preclinical	 models,	Russell	
et al.[15]	(Spark	Therapeutics)	 conducted	 a	phase	III	trial	enrolling 	
31	patients,	 with	confirmed	 genetic	diagnosis	 of	biallelic	RPE65 
mutations,	 sufficient	 viable	retina,	and	the	ability	to	perform	
standardized	 multi‑luminance	 mobility	 testing	(MLMT).	 The	
intervention	 was	bilateral,	 subretinal	 injection	 of	1·5	x	1011	vector	
genomes	 of	voretigene	 neparvovec	 in	0.3	mL	of	total	volume.	
The	primary	efficacy	endpoint	 was	a	1‑year	change	in	the	MLMT	
performance,	 measuring 	functional	 vision	at	specified	 light	levels.	
At	1	year,	the	mean	bilateral	MLMT	change	score	was	significantly 	
higher	in	the	intervention	 group	than	in	the	control	group.	No	
product‑related	 serious	adverse	events	or	deleterious	 immune	
responses	 were	noted.	In	addition,	 a	subset	of	participants	 in	this	
study	was	enrolled	 in	a	separate	 functional	 magnetic	 resonance 	
imaging	 study	that	showed	increased 	activation	 of	the	visual	
cortex	and	evidence	 of	improved	 function	and	structure	 of	visual	
pathways after the intervention.[15]
Voretigene	 neparvovec‑rzyl	 is	composed	 of	human	RPE65c	
DNA	along	with	a	cytomegalovirus	 enhancer	 and	a	hybrid	
chicken	 b‑actin	promoter	 incorporated	 into	a	recombinant 	
AAV2.	Following	 injection	 into	the	subretinal	 space,	AAV2	
enters	RPE	cells.	While	the	viral	vector	remains	in	the	episomal 	
form	in	the	nucleus,	 without	 integrating	 into	the	host	DNA,	
the	enhancer	 and	promoter	 facilitate	 the	expression	 of	RPE65.
In	December	 2017,	the	USFDA	approved	 the	gene	therapy	
“Luxturna” 	(voretigene	 neparvovec‑rzyl), 	developed 	by	Spark	
Therapeutics,	 to	treat	children	 and	adults	with	biallelic	REP65  
mutation‑associated	 retinal	dystrophy	 in	the	United	States.[16] 
Subsequently,	 several	countries	 in	Europe	have	approved	 the	
drug for use.[17,18]2318	 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology	 Volume	 70	Issue	7
In addition to RPE65,  multiple other gene therapy 
trials	for	LCA	are	underway	 for	the	following	 mutations: 	
GUCY2D  (encodes 	retinal	guanylylcyclase‑1, 	a	protein	
expressed	 in	the	outer	PR	and	leading	to	LCA	type	1),[19] and 
CEP290  (encodes 	a	centrosomal	 protein	involved 	in	trafficking 	
through	the	connecting	cilia	of	PR	cells).[20]
Gene therapy for choroideremia
Choroideremia	 is	an	X‑linked	 disorder	 that	leads	to	progressive 	
degeneration	 of	the	PR,	RPE,	and	choriocapillaris,	 mainly	
affecting	 males.	Symptoms	 include	 night	blindness	 and	
progressive	 constriction	 of	visual	fields;	most	affected	 males	
are	legally	blind	by	their	midlife.	The	causative	 gene	has	been	
mapped	 at	Xq21.1‑q21.3;	 mutations	 in	this	gene	lead	to	the	loss	
of	function	 of	a	protein	necessary	 for	retinal	cell	health,	Rab	
Escort	Protein	1	(REP1).[21]
A	phase	I/II	clinical	trial	was	conducted	 by	MacLaren	 et al.,[22] 
in	which	six	patients	 were	administered	 AAV2.REP1	 genome	
particles	 in	the	subretinal	 space.	At	6	months	of	follow‑up, 	
all	patients	 showed	 an	improvement	 in	the	visual	acuity	on	
the	ETDRS	chart	and	an	increase	 in	the	retinal	sensitivity	 on	
the	microperimetry.	 Spark	Therapeutics	 has	sponsored	 an	
open‑label,	 dose‑escalating	 Phase	1/2	trial	designed	 to	assess	
the	safety	and	preliminary	 efficacy	of	subretinal	 administration 	
of	investigational	SPK‑7001	in	choroideremia.[23]
Gene therapy for RP
The	prevalence	 of	RP	in	India	has	been	much	higher	than	that	
noted	in	the	Western	 population.	 Its	prevalence	 ranges	from	1	
in	3,500	in	the	US	to	1	in	1,000	in	China	and	India.[24]
MERTK	is	one	of	the	genes	encoding	 for	a	tyrosine	 kinase,	
required	 for	the	phagocytosis	 of	photoreceptor	 outer	segments 	
by	the	RPE	and	is	associated	 with	a	rare	form	of	autosomal	
recessive	 RP.[25]	A	phase‑1	clinical	trial	utilizing	an	AAV2	vector	
with	an	RPE‑specific	 promoter	 (VMD2)	 driving	 MERTK  in six 
patients	was	published	 in	2016.	However,	 the	results	were	not	
sustained and further trials are awaited.[25]
The RPGR	gene	is	involved	 in	70%	of	X‑linked	 RP	
and	up	to	20%	of	all	RP.	 RPGR	encodes	 for	a	transporter 	
protein	 in	the	cilium,	connecting	 the	inner	and	outer	
segments	 of	photoreceptors	 and	suspected	 to	play	a	role	
in	transporting	 phototransduction	 components	 across	the	
connecting	 cilium.	Currently, 	there	are	multiple 	phase	
1/2	clinical	 trials	that	are	going	on	for	gene	therapy	for	
X‑linked 	RP	with	RPGR mutations.[26] MeiraGTx has just 
concluded	 a	phase	1/2	clinical	 trial	using	a	subretinal 	
injection	 of	AAV2/5	 vector	for	patients	 with	XLRP	caused	
by	mutations	 in	the	 RPGR	gene	(NCT03252847),	 the	
results	of	which	are	awaited.	 They	have	also	started	 a	
phase	3	trial	involving	 the	AAV5	vector	for	patients	with	
XLRP	(NCT04671433).	 Applied	 Genetics	 Technologies 	
Corp.	(AGTC)	 is	planning	 to	conduct	 a	phase	2/3	study	
involving	 subretinal	 injection	 of	recombinant	 adeno‑associated 	
virus	vector	(rAAV2tYF‑GRK1‑hRPGRco‑	 AGTC‑501)	 in	
patients	with	XLRP	caused	by	RPGR	mutations 	(NCT04850118). 	
NightstaRx	 Ltd	is	conducting	 a	phase	1/2	clinical	trial	
using	AAV8	(BIIB112)	 for	patients	with	XLRP	and	RPGR  
mutations	 (NCT03116113).	 Intravitreal	 injection	 of	a	biological, 	
4D‑125	is	being	conducted	 by	4D	Molecular	 Therapeutics	 in	
a	phase	1/2	clinical	trial	in	patients	 with	XLRP  and RPGR 
mutations	(NCT04517149).Gene therapy for Stargardt (STGD) disease
Pathogenesis	 of	STGD	is	linked	to	an	abnormal	 accumulation	 of	
lipofuscin	 in	the	RPE	in	the	early	stages,	followed	 by	slowing	of	the	
rod	and	cone	retinoid	cycles	later	in	the	disease.	The	commonest 	
gene	identified	 for	STGD	is	ABCA4	(chromosome	 1p13‑21)	 for	
the	ABCR	retinal	 ATP	transporter	protein.[27]
The	main	obstacle	in	the	development	 of	gene	therapy	
for	STGD	is	the	larger	size	of	the	ABCA4	gene,	whose	coding	
sequence	 exceeds	the	cargo	capacity	 of	AAV.[28]	In	2019,	Applied	
Genetic	Technologies	 Corporation	 announced	 the	development 	
of	a	hybrid	AAV	dual	vector	and	published	 preclinical	 data	
supporting	 the	potential	 of	this	technology.[29] Promising results 
have	also	been	reported	 in	animal	models	with	a	non‑viral 	
technique	 relying	on	subretinal	 delivery	 of	self‑assembled 	
nanoparticles.[30]
Gene therapy for Achromatopsia (ACHM)
Achromatopsia,	 or	rod	monochromatism,	 is	an	autosomal 	
recessively	 inherited	 disorder	 that	affects	the	cones.	Nearly	90%	
of	patients	with	ACHM	carry	mutations	 in	CNGA3 or CNGB3,	
which	are	the	genes	encoding	 the	alpha	and	beta	subunits	 of	
the	cone	cyclic	nucleotide‑gated	 (CNG)	channel,	 respectively.[31]
Reichel	 et al .[32]	have	recently	 reported	 long‑term	 safety	
and	efficacy	 outcomes 	of	subretinal 	gene	therapy	 for	
CNGA3‑associated 	ACHM.	Nine	patients	were	treated	in	
three	escalating	 dose	groups	with	subretinal	 AAV8.[33] They 
did not note any adverse events related to the treatment. 
Established	 endpoints	 for	cone	vision,	best‑corrected	 visual	
acuity,	and	contrast	sensitivity 	showed	consistent 	improvement 	
over	the	3	years;	however,	 the	fellow	eye	also	showed	a	mild	
improvement,	 and	no	statistical	 significance	 was	noted	between	
the treated and untreated eye.[32]	There	are	multiple	 clinical	
trials	in	phase1/2	 testing	AAV	vectors	in	ACHM	[See	Table 1].
Gene therapy for Usher syndrome (USH)
Usher	syndrome	 is	a	triad	of	RP,	sensorineural	 hearing	
loss,	and	possible	 vestibular	 dysfunction.	 It	is	divided	 into	
three	clinically	 distinct	types	based	on	the	time	course	and	
degree	of	multi‑sensory	 loss‑USH1,	 USH2,	and	USH3.	USH1	
is	the	most	severe	phenotype,	 with	patients	presenting	 at	
birth	with	severe	hearing	loss,	vestibular	 dysfunction,	 and	
early‑onset	 RP;	the	commonest	 mutation	 identified	 is	in	the	
MYO7A  gene. MYO7A	is	a	large	gene,	beyond	the	cargo	
capacity	 of	AAV	vectors,	necessitating	 the	need	for	lenti	and	
dual	vectors.[34]	Currently,	 Sanofi	is	running	 two	trials	to	
investigate	 the	tolerability	 of	subretinal	 administration	 of	an	
EIAV‑based	 lentiviral	 vector	carrying	 MYO7A (SAR421869) 	
for	patients	 affected	 with	USH1B	 (NCT02065011and 	
NCT01505062),	 and	ProQR	Therapeutics	 is	evaluating	 an	
RNA	antisense	 oligonucleotide	 (QR‑421a)	 as	an	intravitreal 	
injection	(NCT05158296).
Table 1 lists	the	current	clinical	trials	in	IRDs.
Cell Therapy
Basics
Visual	impairment	 caused	by	degenerating	 retinal	cells	is	
irreversible	 because	retinal	cells	lack	the	ability	for	self‑repair.	
Cell	replacement	 therapy	 aims	at	replacing	 damaged	 host	
cells	with	transplanted	 donor	cells.	This	is	an	attractive 	
therapeutic 	approach	 because	it	overcomes 	the	limitations 	July	2022	 	 2319

of	gene	therapy	 and	pharmaceutical	 therapies.	 Cell	therapy	
is	mutation‑independent	 and	can	work	even	when	the	cells	
are	completely	 lost.	The	potential	 for	RPE	transplantation	 as	a	
viable	therapy	came	from	studies	noting	improvement	 in	visual	
acuity	following	 the	transplantation	 of	autologous	 RPE	from	
the	peripheral	retina	into	the	submacular	space.[35]
Stem	cells	are	undifferentiated	 cells	present	 at	varying	
stages	of	cell	formation	 and	give	rise	to	differentiated 	cells	
in	various	 organs.	 The	main	characteristics	 of	stem	cells	
are	self‑renewal	 (the	ability	to	proliferate	 extensively), 	
clonality 	(usually	 arising	from	a	single	cell),	and	potency	
(the	ability	to	differentiate	into	different	cell	types).[36]
Stem	cells	can	be	classified	 as	totipotent	 (zygote), 	
pluripotent	 (embryonic	 stem	cells	and	induced	pluripotent	 stem	
cells),	multipotent	 (mesenchymal	 stem	cells),	and	oligopotent.	
Totipotent	 cells	form	embryonic	 and	extra‑embryonic 	
tissues.	Pluripotent	 cells	form	all	three	germ	layers,	whereas	
multipotent	cells	generate	cells	limited	to	one	germ	layer.[37]
Embryonic	 stem	cells	(ESCs)	are	derived	 from	cells	from	
the	inner	cell	mass	of	the	blastocyst	 before	implantation.	 They	
are	pluripotent	 with	an	unlimited	 capacity	 for	self‑renewal 	
and	the	ability	to	give	rise	to	cells	of	all	three	embryonic 	
germ	layers,	namely	ectoderm, 	endoderm,	 and	mesoderm, 	
ultimately	 generating	 all	tissues	in	the	body.	However,	 there	
are	ethical	concerns 	regarding	 the	use	of	ESCs.	They	may	
multidifferentiate	 into	various	cell	types,	making	it	difficult	
to	obtain	cells	of	a	specific	type.	They	have	a	risk	for	tumor	
formation	and	require	immunosuppression.[38]
Induced	 pluripotent	 stem	cells	(iPSCs)	 are	pluripotent 	
stem	cells	generated	 from	somatic	cells	by	cellular	genetic	
reprogramming	 using	defined	transcription	 factors.[36] First 
described	 in	2007	by	Takahashi	 et al.,[39]	iPSCs	can	be	derived	from	
skin	fibroblasts	 or	peripheral	 blood.	Because	they	are	obtained 	
from	terminally	 differentiated	 tissues,	there	are	no	ethical	
concerns	 with	using	iPSCs.	However,	 similar	to	ESCs,	immune	reactions	 and	tumorigenicity	 are	issues	of	concern.	 The	former	
can	be	alleviated	 using	autologous	 cells.	However,	 autologous 	
cells	carry	the	same	genetic	risk	factors	that	the	patient	suffers	
from,	and	therefore	 the	cells	need	further	genetic	manipulation. 	
A	study	combining	 gene	and	cell	therapy	using	the	CRISPR/
Cas9	system	applied	to	the	production	 of	iPSCs	with	selective	
HLA	gene	disruption	 has	been	tried.[40]	Patient‑derived	 human	
iPSC	(hiPSCs)	 and	their	tissue‑specific	 derivatives	 may	be	used	
to	individually	 identify	and	test	drugs	for	their	effectiveness	 in	
a	complex	 genetic	environment.	 These	opportunities	 open	the	
scope	for	personalized	 medicines	 tailored	to	individual	 patients.	
iPSCs	have	also	been	critical	in	advancing	 our	knowledge	 of	the	
underlying	 pathogenesis	 because	it	is	possible	to	create	cell	lines	
from	patients	harboring	 known	mutations	 that	can	be	then	tested	
with	small	molecules	and	drugs.[41]
Transplantation	 of	hESCs	or	allogenic	 hiPSCs	requires 	
systemic 	immunosuppression 	for	at	least	3	months.[42,43] 
Autologous	 transplantation	 of	iPSC‑derived	 cells	has	better	
histocompatibility	than	allogeneic	transplantation	of	cells.
RPE transplantation
The	RPE	is	a	monolayer	 of	highly	specialized	 cuboidal	 cells	
that	lie	between	 Bruch’s	membrane	 and	the	outer	neurosensory 	
retina.	The	RPE	forms	the	outer	blood–retinal	 barrier,	and	
its polarity is important for ion transport.[44]	Several	factors	
make	RPE	transplantation	 an	attractive	 target	for	cell	
transplantation.	 The	cell	structure	 and	function	 of	RPE	are	
fairly	well	understood,	 the	cells	grow	readily	in	laboratory 	
cultures	 and,	unlike	other	cell	types	within	the	retina,	RPE	
cells	do	not	require	synaptic	 connections	 for	their	function.	
Compared	 to	other	organs	in	the	body,	the	number	 of	cells	
required	 for	transplantation	 is	relatively 	small.	In	addition,	 the	
outer	retina	is	easily	amenable	 to	imaging	 via	optical	coherence 	
tomography	(OCT)	and	adaptive	optics.
In in vitro cultures	 of	differentiation	 of	ESCs	and	iPSCs,	the	
cells	mirror	the in vivo developmental	 path	of	RPE	via	the	optic	Table 1: Contd...

neuroectoderm,	 the	eye	field	stage,	committed	 RPE	progenitors, 	
immature	RPE,	and	then	to	mature	RPE.[45]
Although	 most	work	with	RPE	transplants 	has	been	
done	for	dry	AMD,	early	experiments	 in	the	RCS	rats	
with an inherited RPE dystrophy ( MERTK  mutation) have 
demonstrated	 that	subretinal	 injection	 of	healthy	RPE	cells	
allowed	the	preservation	 of	the	outer	nuclear,	outer	plexiform, 	
and	the	photoreceptor	 layer	and	helped	maintain	 visual	
function.[46]
The	rationale	 for	using	cell	replacement	 therapy	in	retinal	
dystrophies	 is	twofold—one,	 that	the	cells	integrate	 with	the	
host	retinal	tissue	and	show	functional	 benefits	and	second	is	
the	benefit	of	neurotrophic 	factors	associated 	with	the	injection	
of	these	cells.[47,48]	Unlike	other	cell	types	in	the	retina,	the	RPE	
cell	layer	does	not	require	synaptic	connections.[49]
The	two	major	strategies	 for	replacing	 atrophic	 RPE	cells	
include	an	RPE	cell	suspension	and	an	RPE	cell	sheet.
1.	 Injection	 of	a	suspension:	 RPE	cells	can	be	injected	 as	a	
suspension	 of	cells	into	the	subretinal	 space.	The	access	to	
the	subretinal	 space	is	achieved	 in	two	ways—via	 a	pars	
plana	vitrectomy,	 detaching	 the	posterior	 vitreous,	 and	
injection	 of	the	cells	through	a	small	gauge	needle,	or	via	the	
suprachoroidal	 approach	 and	access	to	the	subretinal	 space	
through	a	partial	thickness	 sclerotomy.	 Although	 the	ability	
to	perform	 its	essential	 functions	 depends	 on	the	RPE	being	
a	confluent	 monolayer	 with	tight	junctions	 and	maintaining 	
polarity	for	ion	transport	 with	a	healthy	Bruch’s	membrane, 	
a	subretinal	 injection	 of	healthy	RPE	cells	has	been	shown	
to	maintain	 or	improve	 the	health	of	the	outer	nuclear,	
outer	plexiform,	 and	photoreceptor	 inner/out	 segment 	
layers.[46,49,50]	Although	 the	surgical	 implantation	 of	these	
cells	into	the	subretinal	 space	via	a	parsplana	 vitrectomy	
is	relatively	 easy,	cellular	efflux	into	the	vitreous	 cavity	
through	the	retinotomy	 is	a	major	problem.	 The	cells	then	act	
as	a	scaffold	for	the	formation	 of	epiretinal	 membranes.	 An	
adequate	 number	of	cells	may	not	remain	in	the	subretinal	
space	and	the	cells	may	clump	and	not	integrate.
2.	 Transplantation	 of	an	RPE	sheet:	A	patch	of	RPE	cells	is	
considered	 an	ideal	therapeutic	 substrate.	 The	monolayer	
helps	perform	 their	physiological	 functions	 more	efficiently. 	
The	formation	 of	tight	junctions	 between	 RPE	cells	helps	
optimal	polarization	 of	cells,	allowing	 its	interaction	 with	
the	photoreceptor	 outer	segments	 and	supporting 	its	varied	
functions.	 RPE	cells	are	grown	as	a	monolayer	 directly	
or	on	a	scaffold/substrate.	 Mandai	 et al.[48] demonstrated 
1‑year	survival	 of	an	autologous	 iPSC‑derived	 RPE	cell	
sheet	injected	subretinally	 in	two	patients	with	neovascular 	
AMD.	Multiple	 scaffolds	 such	as	polyethylene	 terephthalate, 	
autologous	 sheets	of	cells,	biomaterial‑based	 patches,	 or	
three‑dimensional	 structures	 have	been	tried.[51]	Da	Cruz	
et al.[52]	have	shown	that	a	6	x	3	mm	patch	is	large	enough	
to	cover	almost	the	entire	area	of	a	human	macula.	Delivery 	
of	such	a	large	patch	to	the	subretinal	 area	requires	 a	rather	
complex	 surgery,	 with	a	large	retinotomy	 and	sclerotomy.	
However,	 this	surgery	reduces	the	risk	of	efflux	of	cells	into	
the	vitreous	and	formation	of	epiretinal	membranes.[53]
Another	 interesting	 development	 has	been	retinal	
organoids.	 These	are	three‑dimensional	 structures	 developed	
from	pluripotent	 stem	cells	that	help	in	understanding	 the	
development of the human retina and its diseases.[54,55]Most	clinical	trial	work	using	human	embryonic	 stem	
cells	(hESC)	or	iPSC‑derived	 RPE	has	been	done	in	age‑related 	
macular	degeneration	 and	Stargardt	 disease.	Although	 AMD	is	
not	an	inherited	 retinal	disease,	we	have	included	 the	current	
status	of	cell	therapy	in	AMD	to	acknowledge	 the	progress	 in	
this	field.
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD	is	a	leading	cause	of	severe	visual	impairment	 in	the	
elderly.	Although	 neovascular	 AMD	is	treated	by	anti‑VEGF	
injections,	 there	is	currently	 no	cure	for	dry	AMD.	Considering 	
the	progress	 in	RPE	transplantation,	 cell	replacement	 therapy	
for	dry	AMD	has	gained	considerable	 attention	 in	the	last	
decade.
Currently, 	there	are	several	clinical	trials	in	phase	1/2	
for	the	transplantation	 of	hESC/iPSC‑derived 	RPE	either	as	
suspensions or sheets in patients with dry AMD.[43,47,50] Lineage 
cell	therapeutics	 are	using	a	unique	method	 to	deliver	their	
cells	subretinally	 via	the	suprachoroidal 	approach 	through	
microinjection	 using	the	Orbit	Subretinal	 Delivery	 System	
developed 	by	Gyroscope	 Therapeutics 	(formerly	 Orbit	
Biomedical,	 Ltd.),	which	avoids	the	need	for	retinotomy	 and	
associated	 complications.	 Regenerative	 Patch	Technologies 	
has	developed	 a	composite	 subretinal	 implant,	 named	
the	California	 Project	to	Cure	Blindness‑Retinal	 Pigment 	
Epithelium1	 (CPCB‑RPE1),	 consisting	 of	a	polarized	 monolayer 	
of	human	embryonic	 stem	cell‑derived	 RPE	(hESC‑RPE)	 on	
an	ultrathin,	 synthetic	 parylene	 substrate	 designed	 to	mimic	
Bruch’s	membrane.	 The	discussion	 of	these	clinical	trials	and	
results	is	outside	the	scope	of	this	paper.
Stargardt disease (STGD)
Schwartz	 et al.[42]	conducted	 two	prospective	 Phase	1/2	clinical	
trial	(NCT01469832)	 of	hESC‑derived	 RPE	cells	in	patients	with	
STGD.[43]	Three	doses	of	50000,	100000,	and	150000	cells	were	
injected	 subretinally.	 They	demonstrated	 medium‑term	 to	
long‑term	 safety,	graft	survival,	 and	possible	biological	 activity	
of	pluripotent	 stem	cells.[43] Findings from the UK site of this 
trial	identified	 subretinal	 hyperpigmentation	 consistent	 with	
the	survival	 of	viable	transplanted	 hESC‑derived	 RPE	cells.	
Borderline	 improvements	 in	visual	acuity	were	noted	in	4	of	
12	patients;	 however,	 microperimetry 	did	not	demonstrate 	
evidence	 of	functional	 benefit	at	12	months.[56] Further trials 
are	anticipated,	 including	 evaluation	 of	combined	 RPE,	and	
photoreceptor	transplants.
Sung et al.[57]	reported	 their	3‑year	results	in	three	patients	
with	STGD,	who	received	 hESC‑RPE	 cells	via	a	parsplana 	
vitrectomy	 and	subretinal	 injection.	 All	patients	 had	vision	
less	than	20/400.	Although	 no	patient	showed	adverse	events	
related	to	the	procedure,	 one	patient	was	noted	to	have	a	
rhegmatogenous	 retinal	detachment	 at	19	weeks	of	follow‑up.	
One	patient	showed	best‑corrected	 visual	acuity	improvement, 	
whereas	 the	other	patient	had	stable	best‑corrected	 visual	
acuity	during	the	3‑year	follow‑up	 period.	All	patients	received	
systemic	immunosuppression.[57]
Currently,	 there	are	several	clinical	trials	listed	on	www.
clinicaltrials.gov	 that	are	using	hESCs	for	the	treatment 	
of STGD. STGD is primarily due to mutations in the 
outer	segment	 of	photoreceptors.	 Therefore,	 unlike	AMD,	
replacing	 RPE	cells	alone	may	not	lead	to	sustained	 visual	
benefits.2322	 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology	 Volume	 70	Issue	7
Photoreceptor transplantation
PR	precursor	 transplantation	 is	a	potential	 way	to	treat	retinal	
degenerative	 diseases	 caused	by	PR	loss.	For	most	patients	
with	RP,	rod	PR	death	is	the	primary	 cause	of	night	blindness	
in	the	early	disease	stage.	In	addition,	 rods	account	for	more	
than	90%	of	PR;	thus,	rod	PR	transplantation	 is	a	suitable	
treatment for RP.[58]
MacLaren	 et al.[59]	in	2006	reported	 that	the	transplantation	
of	PR	precursors	 taken	from	immature	 mouse	retinal	cells	into	
wild‑type	 retina	was	able	to	integrate	 into	the	host	PR	layer	
with	a	complete	 mature	morphology.	 Other	groups	reported	
successful	 transplantation	 of	purified	 PR	using	mouse	and	
human	ESC/iPSC	 as	an	effective	 method	of	restoring	 vision	in	
retinal degeneration models.[60,61] Others have proposed that 
these	improvements	 were	not	necessarily	 from	PR	integration; 	
“material	 exchange,”	 whereby	 biomaterials,	 such	as	proteins	
and/or	mRNAs,	 are	transferred	 from	the	donor	to	host	PR,	
and	restore	some	visual	function	 by	rescuing	 remaining	 PR	
cells.[62]	JCyte,	a	California‑based 	company,	 is	testing	the	
intravitreal	 delivery	of	retinal	progenitor	 cells	(NCT03073733). 	
The	goal	for	this	intervention	 is	a	non‑specific	 neurotrophic	
effect	with	emphasis	 on	reviving	 cone	function.	 Lingam	
et al .[63]	transplanted	 PR	precursors	 into	the	subretinal 	
space	of	non‑human	 primates	 and	demonstrated	 survival	
and	maturation	 into	cone	PR	at	3	months	 post‑transplant. 	
Transplantation	 of	PR	and	its	precursors	 continues	 to	be	an	
exciting	area	of	research.
Table 2	lists	the	current	clinical	trials	using	stem	cells.
Advantages of using the eye as an end-organ for gene/cell 
therapy
1.	 Relative	 ocular	immune 	privilege	 limits	an	immune 	
response	to	the	genetic/cellular	material	injected.
2.	 Tight	 blood–ocular	 barrier,	which	limits	the	systemic	 spread	
of	the	injected	material.
3.	 Ease	of	accessibility	directly	to	the	cells	of	interest.
4.	 Ability	 to	monitor	 response	 to	therapy	 noninvasively	 via	
advanced	imaging	systems.
5.	 Ability	to	use	the	contralateral	eye	as  in vivo control.
6.	 A	relatively	 small	number	of	cells	is	required	 for	cell	therapy.
Methods of delivery [ Fig. 1]
Two	common	 methods	 are	being	used	to	introduce	 the	gene	
therapy	product	into	the	eye:
1.	 Subretinal	 injection‑	 This	involves	 a	parsplana	 vitrectomy,	
followed	 by	raising	a	subretinal	 bleb	close	to	the	macula	
with	the	genetic	material/cells	 being	injected	directly	into	the	
subretinal	 space.	Although	 this	creates	a	temporary	 retinal	
detachment,	 this	has	the	advantage	 of	direct	delivery	 to	the	
cells	of	interest.	Procedural	 complications 	include	potential 	
retinal	detachment,	 epiretinal	 membrane	 formation,	 and	
other	complications	associated	with	vitrectomy.
2.	 Intravitreal	 injection:	 This	involves	 a	direct	injection	 into	
the	vitreous 	cavity,	without	 the	need	for	a	vitrectomy. 	
Although	 the	procedure	 is	simpler	 and	associated 	with	
lesser	complications,	 the	availability	 of	genetic	material/
cells	to	the	subretinal	 space	is	difficult.	 In	addition,	 an	
induced	 humoral	 response	 to	the	intravitreally	 delivered	
material	 may	occur,	which	has	not	been	noted	in	subretinal	
injections.	 Intravitreal	 injection	 allows	a	more	widespread	
distribution	 of	the	therapeutic	 agent	over	the	retina	than	subretinal 	delivery, 	using	a	less	challenging	 and	
less‑invasive	 procedure. 	However,	 several	physical	 barriers,	
such	as	the	vitreous,	 the	internal	limiting	 membrane,	 and	
the	inner	retina,	limit	the	diffusion	 of	the	therapeutic	 agent	
to the PR and RPE after intravitreal delivery.
3.	 Suprachoroidal	 approach:	 This	involves	 approaching	 the	
subretinal	 space	through	 a	specialized	 suprachoroidal 	
delivery	 system	(Eg:	Orbit	delivery	 system,	 Gyroscope 	
therapeutics).	 The	advantages	 include	 precise	delivery 	
and	lack	of	reflux	of	therapeutic	 material	 into	the	vitreous	
cavity.	Disadvantages 	include	the	need	for	a	specialized 	
delivery	 system	and	potential	 suprachoroidal	 or	subretinal	
hemorrhage.
Challenges
1.	 Gene	 therapy	 requires	 viable	cells	and	hence	will	not	
be	effective	 in	advanced	 stages	of	IRDs	with	severe	PR	
degeneration.	 Cell	therapy	is	more	viable	in	the	advanced	
stages of the disease.
2.	 It	is	not	definite	 that	gene/cell	 therapy	 can	prevent	 the	
progression of retinal degeneration.
3.	 Gene	 therapy	 is	gene‑specific,	 and	treatment	 for	each	
gene has to go through all the steps of drug development 
including	 animal	studies,	 clinical	trials,	and	regulatory 	
processes.
4.	 Gene	 therapy	is	very	expensive.	 Luxturna,	 the	RPE‑65	gene	
therapy	product	currently	 costs	about	$450,000	 per	injection	
in the US.[16]
5.	 The	ability	to	deliver	genes	to	PR	is	limited	by	the	cargo	
capacity	of	viral	vectors.
6.	 Gene	 and	cell	therapy	are	associated	 with	the	complications 	
inherent	 to	the	method	of	delivery	 of	the	product,	 be	it	
subretinal/intravitreal/suprachoroidal	delivery.
7.	 Potential	 presence/development	 of	anti‑AAV	 antibodies	 in	
the	eye	that	may	reduce	the	efficacy	of	gene	therapy.
8.	 Mutations	 in	genes	such	as	rhodopsin	 that	cause	autosomal 	
dominant	 RP	are	associated	 with	dominant‑negative	 effects.	
Treatment	 of	these	conditions 	necessitates 	the	disruption	 of	
the	mutated	 allele	along	with	the	insertion	 of	a	functional	
copy	of	the	gene.
9.	 Cell	therapy	 requires	 systemic	 immunosuppression	 for	
prolonged	periods	of	time	with	associated	side	effects.
Future Prospects
Science	is	on	the	cusp	of	being	able	to	treat	hitherto	untreatable 	
diseases.	 This	is	a	major	breakthrough	 for	patients	with	IRDs.	
Future	gene	replacement	 therapy	in	IRDs	will	target	patients	at	an	
early	disease	stage	when	the	retinal	architecture	 and	function	are	
still	intact.	Progress	in	retinal	imaging	including	 adaptive	optics,	
microperimetry,	 and	OCT‑angiography	 should	be	able	to	identify	
clinical	markers	that	identify	diseases	and	their	progression	 fairly	
early	so	that	maximum	functional	vision	is	preserved.
Stem	cell	science	is	advancing, 	and	although 	early,	
offers	unprecedented 	opportunities 	for	cell	replacement 	
strategies.	 Obtained	 from	peripheral	 blood	or	a	skin	biopsy,	
iPSC	offers	an	easy	approach	 compared	 to	ESC.	Derivation 	
and	differentiation	 of	human	iPSCs	into	RPEs,	PR,	and	
retinal organoids  in vitro provide	 exciting	 opportunities	 for	
cell‑replacement	 therapy	 and	screening	 small	molecules 	
for	therapeutic	 potential.	 Gene	therapy	 platforms	 may	
allow	the	development	 of	multiple 	therapies, 	reducing 	July	2022	 	 2323
Battu, et al.: Update on cell and gene therapy for IRDs
costs	considerably.	 Gene‑editing	 technologies	 such	as	
CRISPR/Cas9,	 and	their	combination	 with	iPSCs	to	repair	
patient‑specific	 mutations	 heralds	a	new	era	of	precise	and	
personalized	medicine	for	our	patients.
This	has	several	implications	 for	the	clinician.	 Current	
counseling	 of	patients	 with	IRDs	should	include	information	on	current	 results	of	gene	replacement/stem	 cell	trials.	
Furthermore,	 genetic	 testing	 and	identification	 of	the	
underlying	 mutation	 should	be	used	to	support	 the	clinical	
diagnosis.	 In	addition,	 it	is	important	 to	establish	 a	database/
registry	of	patients	with	confirmed	 genetic	mutations	 to	inform	
them	of	forthcoming	 gene/cell	 replacement	 therapies	 and	offer	
them	the	possibility	of	participating	in	future	trials.Table 2: Current stem cell therapies for retinal degenerations
