Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs ) are the most common cause of blindness in working -age 
adults. Macular neovascularization (MNV ) may be a presenting feature or occurs as a late - 
stage complication in several IRDs. We performed an extensive literature review on MNV 
associated with IRDs. MNV is a well -known complication of Sorsby fundus dystrophy and 
pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Those with late -onset Stargardt disease may masquerade as 
exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD ) when MNV is the presenting feature. 
Peripherinopathies may develop MNV that responds well to a short course of anti -vascular 
endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF ) therapy, while bestrophinopathies tend to develop 
MNV in the early stages of the disease without vision loss. Enhanced S-cone syndrome 
manifests type 3 MNV that typically regresses into a subfoveal fibrotic nodule. MNV is only 
a rare complication in choroideraemia and rod-cone dystrophies. Most IRD-related MNVs 
exhibit a favorable visual prognosis requiring less intensive regimens of anti -vascular en-
dothelial growth factor therapy compared to age-related macular degeneration. We discuss 
the role of key imaging modalities in the diagnosis of MNV across a wide spectrum of IRDs 
and highlight the gaps in our knowledge with respect to the natural history and prognosis 
to pave the way for future directions of research.

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) comprise a heterogenous group 
of monogenic diseases exhibiting autosomal dominant or re-
cessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance patterns. 
Despite the approval of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna™), 
for an extremely rare form of RPE65-associated retinopathy, this 
group of diseases remains the most common cause of blindness 
in working-age adults.67,102 Sight-threatening complications, 
such as cystoid macular edema, foveoschisis, macular hole, 
macular pucker, vitelliform lesions, foveal atrophy, and macular 
neovascularization (MNV), occur across a spectrum of IRDs. The 
widespread availability of anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factor (anti-VEGF) agents has led to their frequent use in IRD- 
related MNV, often with little or no level III evidence of effi-
cacy.15,143 It is imperative that we understand the natural history 
of IRD-related MNV to avoid overtreatment, as these lesions may 
be stable for long periods after a short course of anti-VEGF 
therapy, in contrast to those associated with age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD). To date, IRD-related MNV has mostly been 
described in case series111 with variable use of multimodal 
imaging to describe the size and nature of the vascular network. 
In a series of 8 IRD-related MNV cases, followed for 6–148 
months, Marano and coworkers111 emphasized their favorable 
visual prognosis without treatment. This cannot be generalized 
to all IRDs, given that it was published prior to the widespread 
safe and efficacious use of anti-VEGF therapy. The authors de-
scribed the natural history of MNVs associated with Best vitelli -
form dystrophy, pattern dystrophies, gyrate atrophy (GA), and 
retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in which the MNV lesion generally 
underwent spontaneous regression to a small, focal fibrotic scar 
resulting in only mild visual impairment. Nevertheless, these 
findings mirrored prior observations of MNV associated with 
fundus flavimaculatus,26,89,100 reticular dystrophy,113,181 and 
pattern dystrophy.28,110 With the advent of multimodal imaging 
in recent years to phenotype IRDs,52,64,128 it is timely to review 
the literature on IRD-related MNV to facilitate an accurate diag -
nosis and an understanding of the role of observation or anti- 
VEGF therapy. This review is divided into 3 sections focusing on 
IRDs with (1) drusen-like lesions resembling AMD; (2) centrifugal 
progression often characterized by macular flecks, vitelliform 
deposits, or other patterns of pigmentation; and (3) those with 
centripetal progression characterized by early widespread retinal 
involvement, encroaching into the macula in the late stages. In 
this review, the consensus nomenclature for reporting neovas -
cular AMD will be adopted for describing IRD-related MNV.177 For 
each condition, a brief description of the clinical features is fol-
lowed by the MNV imaging characteristics, treatment options, 
and outcomes.  
2.  Drusen-like lesions resembling AMD 
Three rare dominant IRDs share causative genes that are 
integral to extracellular matrix integrity. These are often 
considered phenocopies of AMD due to their characteristic 
subretinal deposits resembling reticular pseudodrusen and 
soft drusen. 
Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD, MIM#136900) is a fully pe-
netrant macular disease with systemic associations due to pathogenic sequence variants in TIMP3 (MIM#188826) located 
on chromosome 22q12.3.189 TIMP3 encodes the third of a 4- 
member family of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases. A total 
of 18 distinct sequence variants in TIMP3 have been identified 
with most being missense mutations in the C-terminal do-
main (exon 5) except for p.(Ser38Cys), the truncating variant 
p.(Glu139 *), and the splice variant c.439–2dupA.98,131 
Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD, MIM#126600), 
also known as malattia leventinese or familial dominant drusen, 
is another fully penetrant disease due to a single variant p. 
(Arg345Trp) in the EFEMP1 (MIM#601548) gene located on chro -
mosome 2p16.1,179 coding the third of a family of 6 extracellular 
matrix glycoproteins (Fibulin 3). 
Late-onset retinal degeneration (LORD, MIM#605670) is a 
fully penetrant Bruch membrane disease due to pathogenic 
sequence variants in C1QTNF5 (MIM#608752) located on 
chromosome 11q23.3,63 a secreted and membrane-associated 
protein responsible for adhesion between the retinal pigment 
epithelial cells and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer 
and the Bruch membrane. To date, 6 amino acid substitutions 
at positions, 163, 180, 186, 188, 190, and 216, have been as-
sociated with LORD or GA-like choroidal dystrophy.25,82,178 
The p.(Ser163Arg) is the most common founder mutation 
encountered.96 Variable phenotypes have been reported be-
tween these variants, which may account for differences in 
the risk of MNV formation.193,194 Fig. 1 demonstrates the un-
ique clinical phenotypes of these 3 AMD masquerades.  
2.1.  SFD 
SFD presents in the fourth decade to the fifth decade with a 
visual impairment from MNV or macular atrophy.173 Clini -
cally, patients often report impaired vision in low lighting 
with central scotomas or peripheral visual field defects re-
lated to expanding geographic atrophy, MNV, or both. On 
multimodal imaging, reticular pseudodrusen56 are frequently 
observed in the sixth decade of life, progressing to diffuse 
elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from Bruch 
membrane.83 
MNV is found in over 60% of SFD, and most have bilateral 
sequential lesions separated by a median onset of 3 years.12,170 
MNV may be type 1, type 2, or a variant of polypoidal choroidal 
vascularization in the mid-periphery.22,36,57,91 Optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have been 
used to noninvasively demonstrate MNV and its regression 
after treatment in SFD.126 Although the underlying pathophy -
siology of TIMP3 mutations remains unknown, animal and in 
vitro studies have suggested both gain and loss of function re-
sulting in altered TIMP3 turnover and reduced metalloprotei -
nase inhibitory activity. Downstream effects of altered TIMP3 
function may include increased VEGF binding to VEGF receptor 
274,151 and the loss of inhibition of 2 enzymes, disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), which facilitate the release of 
tumor necrosis factor alpha, resulting in proinflammatory and 
proangiogenic effects.171 This may explain the high risk of MNV 
and the potential extraocular associations in SFD.105,118 
Argon laser, photodynamic therapy (PDT), steroids, anti- 
VEGF agents, and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha biologics 
have been described as treatments (Table 1). The initial 2 have 2 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   now been abandoned in favor of anti -VEGF agents due to their 
poor visual outcomes.12,170 Sivaprasad and coworkers12,170 hy-
pothesized that the abnormal RPE-Bruch membrane complex 
may accelerate recurrent MNV formation following laser, and 
the thickened Bruch membrane may limit penetration of PDT. 
They noted a short -term (6 month ) benefit in combining jux-
tascleral depot administration of anecortave, an anti -angio -
genic analog of cortisol acetate, with an intravitreal anti -VEGF 
agent.12,170 Others have also noted limited benefit from 
PDT.145,191 The long -term data (> 5 years ) on bevacizumab and 
ranibizumab have demonstrated safety and efficacy although 
intraocular inflammation has been associated with the off-label 
use of bevacizumab.11,12,47,50,58,78,79,81,117,126,185 There remains no 
consensus on dosing regimens despite a treat and extend protocol being advocated by Kaye and coworkers79 and Tso-
kolas and coworkers.185 Conversely, Gliem and coworkers57 and 
Baston and coworkers12 recommended monthly monitoring 
and pro re nata injection to reduce the treatment burden. 
Spaide176 recently reported the use of subcutaneous adali -
mumab (an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha ), as a mo-
lecularly targeted approach. He described a 35-year -old woman 
with bilateral aggressive MNV initially treated with intravitreal 
4-mg triamcinolone and later bevacizumab. Over a follow -up 
period of 18 months, there were no signs of disease activity 
once the patient was switched to adalimumab.176 Further in-
vestigations into the use of other anti -tumor necrosis factor 
alpha agents, such as etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab 
pegol, and golimumab, are now warranted. 
Fig. 1 – Illustrative cases of Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) (A–D), Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) (E–H), and late- 
onset retinal degeneration (I–M). Optos imaging of a 47-year-old male with nyctalopia and scotomas showed parafoveal 
atrophy (A) and speckled hyperautofluorescence surrounding central hypoautofluorescent patches (B). Optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) showed diffuse and irregular elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) secondary to Bruch’s 
membrane-RPE separation in the parafoveal (C) and foveal regions (D). SFD was suspected and confirmed with a pathogenic 
TIMP3 variant identified. Optos imaging of an asymptomatic 51-year-old male showed small macular drusen and drusen at 
the disc margin (E), which were hyperautofluorescent (F). OCT showed a nodular elevation of the RPE at the site of the disc 
margin (G), which must be distinguished from peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMSs) that are 
hyperreflective lateral bulges from distended axons due to axoplasmic stasis and resides above the RPE (H). Genetic analysis 
confirmed DHRD due to the known EFEMP1 mutation. Optos imaging of a 61-year-old female with nyctalopia showed 
peripheral white dots (I, inset) and specked hyperautofluorescence in the macular region (J). OCT showed subretinal discrete 
deposits corresponding to the white dots and diffuse elevation of the RPE (K). Anterior zonules were long (L), and there was 
diffuse thickening of the Bruch membrane (M). Genetic analysis confirmed late-onset retinal degeneration due to a C1QTNF5 
mutation.   3 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   Table 1 – Summary of Treatment Outcomes in Drusen-like Lesions Resembling Age-related Macular Degeneration.

DHRD typically presents in the fourth decade to fifth decade 
with mild visual impairment that often progresses to severe 
impairment of acuity (< 20/200) from geographic atrophy or 
MNV.93 The mutant EFEMP1 is misfolded and subsequently 
accumulates within the RPE and between the RPE and Bruch 
membrane. Although not entirely understood, animal studies 
have shown increased basal lamina deposits, excessive 
complement C3 activation, and generalized RPE and chor -
oidal abnormalities, setting the scene for MNV forma -
tion.45,115,116 Clinically, small white radially orientated 
drusen are seen in the perimacular region, as described by 
Vogt originally,43,147,187 progressing to the more typical ma-
cular drusen that appear in a honeycomb arrangement as 
described by Doyne.40 The pathognomonic hyperauto -
fluorescent disc margin drusen of DHRD174 are distinct from 
optic disc drusen or peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass- 
like structures.65 Peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass- 
like structures are hyperreflective bulges of axons herniating 
laterally over the disc margin, secondary to axoplasmic 
stasis, which rests upon the RPE/basement membrane com -
plex (Fig. 1H). Conversely, optic disc drusen are hypore -
flective structures within the optic nerve head that projects a 
hyperreflective border. In contrast, disc margin drusen are 
nodular elevations of the RPE adjacent to the Bruch mem -
brane opening (Fig. 1G). The formation of confluent drusen 
with a honeycomb appearance is also accompanied by a 
diffuse elevation of the RPE layer. 
In a large series of 24 patients from 19 families with DHRD, 
only 1 developed MNV, whereas the majority lost vision from 
macular atrophy.120 Serra and coworkers167 compared OCTA 
features with fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, 
indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and OCT in 4 patients 
with DHRD. They found that OCTA identified flow signals in 3 
eyes with exudative MNV, while other multimodal imaging 
did not demonstrate any leakage. 45,115,116 
Reports of treatment in DHRD-related MNV remain limited 
to surgical excision, argon laser, PDT, and anti-VEGF therapy 
(Table 1). Pager and coworkers described subretinal surgery 
in a case presenting with acute vision loss due to an active 
MNV.138 Although the surgically excised submacular tissue 
failed to show histologic evidence of MNV, clinical assess -
ment 2 months after surgery demonstrated restoration of 
visual acuity from 20/100–20/20 and no evidence of fluor -
escein leakage on angiography. A case report by Ladas and 
coworkers82 illustrated the unusual coexistence of a poly -
poidal choroidal vascularization variant of MNV in a patient 
with DHRD. Here, indocyanine green angiography-guided 
argon laser was performed on the active peripapillary and 
perifoveal polypoidal lesions. The authors noted a favorable 
anatomic and functional outcome 3 years posttreatment with 
a visual acuity of 20/20 in the treated eye. Dantas and cow -
orkers39 also reported effective treatment with a single PDT 
application followed for 34 weeks. Sohn and coworkers172 
reported 2 cases of MNV responding to 2 and 7 doses of 
bevacizumab followed for 15 and 30 months, respectively. 
Visual acuities in the affected eyes improved from 20/250 to 
20/50 and from 20/200 to 20/20, respectively. Enomoto and 
coworkers reported a case of bilateral sequential MNV separated by 9 years with a 15-year follow-up.42 One eye de-
veloped scarring despite 20 bevacizumab injections, while 
the MNV in the fellow eye was stabilized with only 2 ranibi -
zumab injections over a 5-year period. Patel and coworkers144 
explored the utility of OCTA in IRDs complicated by MNV 
including a case of DHRD. They found that, after 5 intravitreal 
bevacizumab injections, the MNV remained largely un-
changed with respect to vessel area on OCTA despite a re-
duction in subretinal fluid (SRF) and continued visual acuity 
decline over 16 weeks. Sheyanth and coworkers found no 
change in visual acuity or angiographic leak in a patient re-
ceiving bilateral aflibercept for MNV after 3 doses.169 These 
case report and series illustrated the variable treatment re-
sponses in DHRD. Fig. 2 illustrates a case of DHRD-related 
MNV responding well to anti-VEGF therapy.  
2.3.  LORD 
LORD typically presents with delayed dark adaptation and 
reduced vision in low lighting during the fifth decade to the 
sixth decade, accompanied by numerous yellow-white sub-
retinal deposits in the peripheral and perifoveal regions. 
Central vision is gradually lost by the seventh decade from 
advancing chorioretinal atrophy through the fovea. Similar to 
SFD, reticular pseudodrusen are commonly seen in the sixth 
decade to the seventh decade with spontaneous regression 
by the eighth decade.24 Despite histopathological evidence of 
a thickened Bruch membrane,63,92,121 spectral domain-OCT 
has not demonstrated increased RPE elevation with advan -
cing disease.83 A unique anterior segment feature includes 
the long anterior zonules with peripupillary iris transillumi -
nation defects.97,180 Borooah and coworkers proposed a sta-
ging system (stages 1–3) based on patient age, anterior and 
posterior segment findings, and the presence of sight-threa -
tening complications such as MNV or atrophy.23 
MNV has been shown to involve both the macular and 
peripheral retina.9,24,109,155 Borooah and coworkers reviewed 
cases of stage 3 LORD and found several reports of sudden 
and severe visual decline likely associated with MNV;23 
however, choroidal neovascularization may be asympto -
matic and remain peripheral, as demonstrated by Keenan 
and coworkers using widefield ICG angiography and OCTA.80 
The mutant protein is thought to act in a dominant negative 
manner, whereby the wildtype protein is depleted through 
oligomerization with the mutant protein. Animal models 
suggest variability in the dominant negative mechanisms 
amongst different variants.193 Therefore, the molecular me-
chanisms leading to RPE dysfunction, Bruch membrane de-
posits, and subsequent atrophy and MNV formation remain 
unclear.92,121 
Focal laser and anti-VEGF therapies have been described 
for the treatment of LORD-related MNV (Table 1). Ayyagari 
and coworkers described the use of focal laser for MNV in 3 
sisters from a dominant pedigree with LORD.9 There was a 
prompt response from 2 separate MNV lesions in the same 
eye within days of the laser; however, new MNVs developed 
over subsequent months, at the margins of the treated areas 
that eventually encroached into the subfoveal region. No-
tably, even with a low-energy laser setting, there was com -
plete ablation of the RPE and choriocapillaris indicating a 6 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   vulnerability of these layers in LORD. Mandal and Lotery re-
ported anti -VEGF use in LORD -related MNV demonstrating 
clinical efficacy with a course of 3 monthly injections using 
ranibizumab and bevacizumab.109 Although macular fluid 
resolved promptly, the MNV recurred bilaterally 17 months 
later.109 Ganesth and coworkers described a single aflibercept 
injection in a patient with LORD -related MNV.48 Importantly, 
not all LORD -related MNV requires treatment as some of 
these are type 1 nonexudative membranes.80  
3.  Centrifugal diseases, including vitelliform 
and pattern dystrophies 
This group of disorders demonstrates a macular predilec -
tion with greater cone than the rod system involvement in 
electrophysiology. The centrifugal IRDs associated with 
MNV include ABCA4 -related retinopathy (MIM#601691 ) or 
Stargardt disease, PRPH2 -related retinopathy (MIM#179605 ) or 
peripherinopathies, BEST1 -related retinopathy (MIM#607854 ) 
or bestrophinopathies, mutations in DHS6S1, upstream 
from the PRDM13 gene, (MIM#616842 ) or North Carolina 
macular dystrophy, and ABCC6 -associated retinopathy 
(MIM#603234 ) or angioid streaks complicating pseudox -
anthoma elasticum (PXE ).  
3.1.  ABCA4 -associated retinopathy or Stargardt disease 
Stargardt disease is the most common IRD,158 accounting for 
12% of IRD-related blindness.67 Although macular atrophy is 
the predominant cause of visual loss, there is increasing re-
cognition that MNV can lead to significant visual impair -
ment.64,89 Cases of foveal sparing atrophy with subfoveal 
MNV in late -onset disease may easily be misdiagnosed as 
AMD due to the resemblance between flecks and drusen on 
fundus examination.69,190 To date, only a few case reports and series have described 
the use of laser photocoagulation,89 PDT,75,86,175 and anti - 
VEGF therapy14,16,152 in patients with phenotypes suggestive 
of Stargardt disease, albeit some with incomplete genotyping 
(Table 2). Focal laser is no longer recommended because of 
collateral damage to the vulnerable RPE. Although the results 
of PDT were varied, they were, in general, better than the 
outcomes seen in neovascular AMD. The number of PDT 
sessions ranged from 1 to 12 with variable visual outcomes 
from 20/200 to 20/20. Ranibizumab has been reported to be 
efficacious in reducing macular fluid in some patients with a 
final VA outcome ranging from 20/400 to 20/30; however, 
Battaglia Parodi and coworkers16 raised concerns that VEGF 
inhibition may accelerate atrophy growth in Stargardt -re-
lated MNV due to the vulnerability of the lipofuscin -rich RPE. 
OCTA studies have shown profound choroidal flow signal 
voids within the inner choroidal vasculature in Stargardt 
disease compared to AMD. Rarefaction of the choriocapillaris 
flow signals also extended beyond RPE atrophy in Stargardt 
disease.1129,157 Thus, studies using OCTA in a genotyped 
Stargardt disease cohort with MNV are essential to determine 
the natural history and the role of anti -VEGF therapy. Fig. 3 
illustrates a case of Stargardt disease -related MNV re-
sponding to anti -VEGF with late visual loss secondary to 
progressive macular atrophy.  
3.2.  Pattern dystrophies 
Pattern dystrophy is a term used to describe 5 phenotypically 
distinct disorders, namely, adult -onset foveomacular vitelliform 
dystrophy, butterfly -shaped pigment dystrophy, reticular dys-
trophy, multifocal pattern dystrophy simulating Stargardt dis-
ease, and fundus pulverulentus. Three of these phenotypes are 
known to be associated with PRPH2 -related retinal dystrophy 
(peripherinopathies ), whereas adult -onset foveomacular vitelli -
form dystrophy is known to be associated with pathogenic

honeycomb retinal dystrophy showing numerous macular drusen and peripapillary atrophy in the right eye (A, B). OCT 
showed subretinal hyperreflective material and intraretinal cystoid changes consistent with macular neovascularization (C). 
Visual acuity declined from 6/15–6/60 over a 5-month period of observation with worsening of the cystoid spaces (D). After 3 
monthly ranibizumab injections, macular fluid resolved (E). The patient received a total of 35 injections using a treat and 
extend protocol gradually stretching the interval to 12-weekly with no recurrence of fluid at 7 years (F). Visual acuity declined 
to 6/38 due to early foveal atrophy.   7 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   Table 2 – Summary of Treatment Outcomes in Stargardt Disease and PRPH2-Associated Retinal Disease.

Butterfly -shaped pigment dystrophy can also be associated with 
CTNNA1 variants.161 Pattern dystrophy seen with myotonic 
dystrophy has been associated with MNV.197 The increasing 
use of OCT and OCTA has improved the detection of types 
1 and 3 MNV in adult -onset foveomacular vitelliform dys-
trophy76,103,144,153,154 by allowing direct visualization of flow sig-
nals within the MNV network.149 A large retrospective case 
series reported stable visual acuity in adult -onset foveomacular 
vitelliform dystrophy -related MNV with ranibizumab therapy;123 
however, spontaneous resolution of MNV in pattern dystrophy 
has also been described emphasizing the need for caution when 
interpreting favorable results in interventional case series.5 MNV 
and its treatment with anti -VEGF therapy have also been re-
ported in cases of North Carolina macular dystrophy10 and a 
genetically uncharacterized cone dystrophy.60 
Peripherinopathy can manifest as butterfly pattern dys-
trophy, vitelliform macular dystrophy, central areolar chor -
oidal dystrophy, pattern dystrophy simulating fundus 
flavimaculatus, and RP.66 Symptoms and age of onset vary 
depending on the phenotype with some patients remaining 
asymptomatic. MNV occurs frequently in peripherinopathy 
pedigrees affecting 5%–18% of cases.85,88,186 Oishi and cow -
orkers137 reported 40 Japanese patients from 30 families with 
PRPH2 -associated retinal dystrophy and found MNV in only 2 
patients (5%, aged 49 and 55) with an RP phenotype, of which 
one had concurrent high myopia. Antonelli and coworkers7 
examined 28 subjects from 11 unrelated families carrying 
pathogenic heterozygous PRPH2 variants and found MNV in 5 patients (18% ) of which extensive chorioretinal atrophy was 
found in 2, pattern dystrophy in 2, and central areolar chor -
oidal dystrophy in 1. The authors concluded that OCTA was 
highly informative for MNV detection despite the presence of 
extensive chorioretinal atrophy. 
Single cases of clinically suspected or genetically confirmed 
that PRPH2 -associated retinal dystrophy has illustrated excellent 
long -term visual outcomes over a 7-year period with a single 
session of PDT17,99 or only a few anti -VEGF injections 
(Table 2).44,99,134,186,192 One of the 2 patients reported by Oishi and 
coworkers developed bilateral sequential MNV 8 years apart and 
received > 60 anti -VEGF injections over 13 years.137 Despite bi-
lateral anti -VEGF therapy, visual acuity declined to 20/100 and 
20/50 due to progressive atrophy.125,137 Bianco and coworkers20 
reported 2 of 19 patients (11% ) aged 46 and 47 years with mul -
tifocal pattern dystrophy to exhibit exudative MNV receiving 
only 6 and 2 anti -VEGF injections, respectively, to maintain a 
visual acuity of 20/20 and 20/25 over 4–5 years. OCTA may play a 
role in identifying asymptomatic type 1 MNV44 and monitoring 
for disease recurrence with a pro re nata treatment regimen.192 
Phenotypic risk factors for MNV formation in PRPH2 remain 
unknown as the current literature consists of only a small case 
series.68 Fig. 4 illustrates a case of stable type 1 MNV in PRPH2 - 
related retinal dystrophy after 1 year of anti -VEGF therapy.  
3.3.  Bestrophinopathies

showing hyperautofluorescent flecks in the macular and peripapillary region (A) and central atrophy that expanded 6 years 
later to involve the fovea (B). OCT imaging at presentation showed subfoveal type 1 macular neovascularization with 
subretinal hyperreflective material causing visual decline to 6/30 (C). At 1 month after the first injection, the fluid resolved 
with improved visual acuity to 6/15 (D). The macula remained dry at 16 weeks. E: OCT scans after a total of 28 injections at 6 
years showed no fluid (E). Note that the juxtafoveal atrophy encroaching into the fovea limited the visual acuity to only 6/19. 
OCT angiography at baseline showed no obvious flow signal at the site of the pigment epithelial detachment (PED) (F). Once 
fluid resolved, flow signals within the PED were better visualized showing a neovascular network.   9 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   dystrophy with multifocal vitelliform lesions, which may be 
accompanied by 1, 2, or 3 type MNV.72,84,124,165,196 These can 
be exudative (typically in the early stages, 2–3) or non -
exudative (usually in the late stages, 4–5). 21 
With clinical examination alone, MNV was found in only 
2%–9% of BVMD.37,122,127 Using spectral domain -OCT, a larger 
case series of recessive bestrophinopathies by Kim and cow -
orkers87 and Khan and coworkers31 showed 10% and 14% of 
patients, respectively, exhibiting features suspicious of MNV (i.e., 
pigment epithelial detachment with or without focal choroidal 
excavation ). OCTA has improved the detection of MNV144,168 
with Guduru and coworkers59 reporting 6 of 10 (60% ) patients 
and Battaglia Parodi and coworkers18 showing that 24 of 66 (36% ) 
eyes had MNV, most observed with stage 4 and 5 lesions. It is 
now recognized that MNV is no longer confined to stage 6 dis-
ease as once proposed.49 MNV can be observed in earlier stages 
potentially altering the natural course of vitelliform lesions.38,62 
For example, Han and coworkers showed that 63% of eyes with 
Gass stage 2 vitelliform lesions had OCTA evidence of MNV. A 
new classification was proposed, whereby MNV may form in 
stage 2 or 3 in response to impaired choroidal perfusion as de-
monstrated by Guduru and coworkers in their OCTA study.59 
Initially, the MNV was covered by intact RPE forming a type 1 
configuration with stable visual acuity. Loss of RPE integrity with 
or without a breakthrough of the MNV (type 2) leads to reabsorption of the subretinal deposit and collapse of the vi-
telliform lesion resulting in the visual loss (stage 4). Reversal to 
stage 2 or 3 with recovery of vision may occur when RPE integrity 
is restored through spontaneous or anti -VEGF -induced MNV re-
gression. Han and coworkers found 2 structural features to be 
associated with MNV: subretinal pillars and focal choroidal ex-
cavation.59 
In a retrospective review of 14 eyes from 12 patients (11 
with BVMD ), Khan and coworkers84 reported that MNV was 
typically active prior to stage 4, developing at a mean age of 
15.5 years (range: 6–72 ). Over a median follow -up period of 2.8 
years, they reported a high rate of spontaneous regression of 
BEST1 -related MNV although active treatment with in-
travitreal bevacizumab was associated with statistically 
better visual acuity outcomes (logMAR ) than observation 
alone (−0.46 versus 0.17, Table 3). Here, 7 eyes were treated 
with intravitreal bevacizumab, while 7 eyes underwent ob-
servation. Interestingly, most patients only required a single 
intravitreal injection (median 1, range: 1–10 ). Similarly, 
Miyagi and coworkers showed no significant visual gain with 
ranibizumab in patients with BVMD (Table 3).115 
In a retrospective case series of 27 unrelated recessive 
bestrophinopathy patients, Casalino and coworkers31 re-
ported SRF in 75% at presentation with almost 50% of the SRF 
located within the subfoveal region. Importantly, SRF did not

showed an asymptomatic subfoveal vitelliform lesion (C), which remained stable until age 63 when she presented with new 
onset distortion due to an acute increase in subfoveal hyperreflective material secondary to an exudative macular 
neovascularization (D). At 1 year, after receiving 10 anti-VEGF injections using a treat and extend regimen, her visual acuity 
was 6/7.5, and there was no macular fluid at 10 weeks posttreatment (E). Treatment was withheld and visual acuity was 
maintained at 6/7.5 for the following 4 years after cessation of anti-VEGF therapy. OCT angiography showed a flow signal 
within the shallow vascularized PED indicating the persistence of the nonexudative type 1 macular neovascularization (F).   10 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   Table 3 – Summary of Treatment Outcomes Bestrophinopathies and Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum.

and 1 with type 1 MNV. Type 3 MNV has been reported in 
recessive bestrophinopathy although the accompanying 
macular fluid was not responsive to anti -VEGF therapy. This 
suggests a disrupted blood -retina barrier or RPE pump dys-
function.196 Indications for treating MNV remain con -
troversial due to our evolving understanding of the life cycle 
of MNV in relation to the formation of a vitelliform lesion and 
the presence of SRF. Some advocate for a conservative ap-
proach guided by fluorescein leakage,141 while others re-
commend a trial of anti -VEGF when a transition from stage 2/ 
3 to stage 4 occurs. Here, the intent is to reconstitute SRF and 
the vitelliform lesion.62 Fig. 5 illustrates a case of fluctuating 
MNV activity in a recessive bestrophinopathy case observed 
over 10 years without treatment.  
3.4.  PXE 
Angioid streaks in PXE represent breaks in a calcified Bruch 
membrane, which predisposes to the formation of multifocal 
MNV in up to 86% of patients51,55 The natural history of un-
treated MNV in PXE is poor, with visual acuities declining to 
< 20/200 in the fourth decade to the fifth decade due to the 
development of a disciform scar and atrophy.54 
A literature review of 54 studies (> 160 cases ) using anti - 
VEGF therapy or PDT for PXE -related MNV showed a 6-line 
improvement in visual acuity with both treatment mod -
alities.54 While laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal lesions 
provided similar results to PDT, the authors cautioned against its use due to frequent MNV recurrences and laser - 
induced scotomas.160 There was no benefit in combining 
PDT with anti -VEGF therapy.54 More recent prospective 
interventional case series and randomized controlled trials 
support the safety and efficacy of anti -VEGF monotherapy 
across all 3 agents (bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibi -
zumab ),53,70,94,142,166 while long -term (> 4 years ) retrospective 
case series demonstrated that visual acuity can be main -
tained with close monitoring and retreatment for MNV re-
currences.160,166,183,184 A summary of the outcome data from 
these prospective and retrospective studies is summarized in  
Table 3. Fig. 6 illustrates a case of PXE with prompt response 
to 2 anti -VEGF injections with no recurrence after 2 years.  
4.  Centripetal diseases including choroidal 
dystrophies 
This group of disorders has a predilection for early peripheral 
retinal involvement with rod greater than cone system dys-
function on electrophysiology. The centripetal IRDs of most 
interest with respect to MNV are those associated with NR2E3 
(MIM#694485 ) or enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS ) and CHM 
(MIM#399389 ) or choroideremia.  
4.1.  ESCS or Goldmann -Favre syndrome 
Patients with ESCS typically manifest early onset nyctalopia 
with increased sensitivity to blue light. Visual acuity often 
remains stable, and electroretinography shows a slow 
Fig. 5 – Optos imaging of a 9-year-old boy with a genetically confirmed recessive bestrophinopathy showing extensive 
multifocal subretinal vitelliform lesions (A) that were hyperautofluorescent (B). Visual acuity declined from 6/15–6/19 during 
10 years of observation. This was associated with a reduction in the vitelliform lesions and subsequent formation of 
subfoveal fibrotic scar (C, D). OCT at baseline showed intraretinal cystoid changes with subretinal fluid and vitelliform 
deposits (E). At age 13, subretinal hyperreflective material was noted adjacent to the fovea (F). A month later, a well-defined 
PED was noted (G). Six months later, the PED collapsed, accompanied by the resolution of intraretinal and subretinal fluid (H). 
Intraretinal cystoid changes returned gradually and after 10 years, and there was cystoid cavitation in the macula (I). En face 
OCT angiography shows a neovascular network (J) that corresponded to the flow signal within the collapsed PED (K). This 
flow signal persisted with a recurrence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid 2 months later (L).   12 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   decline in parallel to age-related changes.30 Color funduscopy 
shows nummular pigmentary changes along the vascular 
arcades at the level of the RPE in 86%, yellow -white dots in 
57%, foveomacular schisis in 41%, torpedo -like lesion in 11%, 
and circumferential subretinal fibrosis in 7%.30 
In a recent large case series, Alsalamah and coworkers4 
reported subretinal fibrosis in 47% of their cohort and pro-
posed 2 types of stable subretinal fibrotic reactions: a central 
macular unifocal fibrotic nodule and circumferential sub-
retinal fibrosis. Nowilaty and coworkers hypothesized that 
the former is closely related to the formation and/or regres -
sion of type 3 MNV,106,136,195 as demonstrated by FA or OCTA. 
These 2 phenotypes of subretinal fibrosis do not coexist in 
the same eye. Retinochoroidal anastomosis has been ob-
served in children as young as 2 years of age. 
Active lesions demonstrating hemorrhage and exudation 
have been treated with anti -VEGF agents with limited struc -
tural and functional improvement. In all cases, the type 3 
MNV evolved into a central macular unifocal fibrotic nodule 
surrounded by a depigmented halo.4136 One patient in Now -
ilaty and coworkers’ series received a subretinal tissue 
plasminogen activator for the displacement of a massive 
subretinal hemorrhage associated with a type 3 MNV re-
sulting in marked visual improvement. These peculiar sub-
retinal fibrotic reactions within the central or paramacular 
region may lead to a misdiagnosis of inflammatory eye disease in a pediatric cohort.4135 Given the recent findings of 
type 3 MNV in ESCS, further OCTA investigations should be 
considered when re-examining previously published cases of 
choroidal neovascularization (i.e., type 1 or type 2 
MNV ).19,27,32,95,114,133,135,162 The role of anti -VEGF therapy in 
active type 3 MNV remains uncertain. However, a trial of anti - 
VEGF therapy may have a role in those with acute visual 
decline secondary to exudative and hemorrhagic type 3 MNV.  
Fig. 7 illustrates an unusual combination of central and cir-
cumferential multifocal subretinal fibrotic lesions in the 
same eye of a patient with ESCS. The central lesions were 
type 3 MNV based on OCTA.  
4.2.  Choroideremia and choroideremia carriers 
MNV is a known, but rare, complication seen in choroider -
emia and CHM carriers. Untreated MNV tends to result in 
subretinal fibrosis.41,148,159,163 Similarly, untreated MNV in 
CHM carriers results in poor visual outcomes, as shown in 2 
previous reports;41 however, Compos -Pavon and Torres - 
Pena29 reported spontaneous resolution of MNV in a 30-year - 
old man with choroideremia, who presented with a visual 
acuity 20/100 and an associated macular hemorrhage. By 
6 months, the MNV had resolved, and vision improved to 
20/25. 
Fig. 6 – Optos imaging of a 46-year-old woman with genetically confirmed pseudoxanthoma elasticum showing angioid 
streaks (A) and peripapillary hyperautofluorescent subretinal deposits (B). Two years later, she presented with new onset 
distortion in the left eye due to a subfoveal hemorrhage (C, D). En face OCTA at baseline showed a normal deep vascular 
plexus (E) and a subfoveal nonexudative vascularized PED as shown by the central flow signal (F) within the PED (G). Two 
years later, OCT imaging showed subretinal hyperreflective material from the bleed due to active type 1 macular 
neovascularization. This resolved after receiving 2 ranibizumab injections and visual acuity was maintained at 6/6 at 2 years 
after treatment.   13 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   Luttrell and Breazeale104 reported laser photocoagulation 
of an extrafoveal MNV in an 11-year -old boy with choroider -
emia, and vision improved from 20/200 to 20/30. Two reports 
of bevacizumab in 13-year -old boys with MNV showed that 
visual acuity could be maintained with 6 and 10 injections, 
respectively, over a 1-year period.34,139 Ranjan and coworkers 
reported that only 5 ranibizumab injections were required 
over a 3-year period to treat a 13-year -old male with subfoveal 
MNV secondary to choroideremia;156 however, Patel and 
coworkers144 reported a case of a 14-year -old boy with chor -
oideremia requiring bevacizumab injections every 4–8 weeks 
initially in the left eye. Over a period of 16 months, he re-
ceived a total of 13 injections, and his vision improved from 
20/200 to 20/50. At 24 months, no injection was administered, 
and his vision again dropped to 20/100 with an increase in 
SRF. OCTA in this case showed a persistent flow signal within 
the subretinal tissue unlike other reported cases where the 
MNV lesions resolved completely. Ang and coworkers6 de-
scribed a 44-year -old choroideremia carrier with a subfoveal 
MNV located at the edge of myopic chorioretinal atrophy. 
Macular fluid responded promptly to anti -VEGF injections, 
but recurrences over 2 years and 10 months required a total 
of 14 injections. Given the severe myopic chorioretinal 
atrophy and the location of the new vessel, it may be more     likely that the MNV was secondary to myopia. Fig. 8 illus -
trates a case of a female CHM carrier with type 2 MNV re-
sponding promptly to anti -VEGF treatment with no 
recurrence following 2 years of observation.  
4.3.  Other choroidal dystrophies and RP 
Three choroidal dystrophies have been associated with MNV: 
GA (MIM#258870 ), Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy 
(MIM#210370 ), and dominant RPE65 -related chorioretinal 
dystrophy (RP87, MIM#618697 ). Furthermore, 10 cases of ge-
netically uncharacterized RP have reported MNV. 
GA, caused by a deficiency in the vitamin B6-dependent 
mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine ketoacid amino -
transferase, has been associated with subfoveal MNV.112 
Chatziralli and coworkers33 reported a 35-year -old male with 
GA responding promptly to 3 ranibizumab injections with no 
recurrence of SRF at 6 months. His visual acuity improved 
from 6/60 to 6/48. Inanc and coworkers71 reported a 20-year - 
old man with bilateral MNV responding to a single dose of 
bevacizumab with no additional treatment required at 1 year. 
Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy is caused by 
biallelic mutations in CYP4V2 and results in altered fatty acid 
metabolism. Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy has

unusual co-occurrence of central bifocal (2 white arrows in insert) and circumferential multifocal nodular fibrotic lesions. 
There were peripapillary hyperautofluorescent subretinal deposits (B). Three years later, there was no significant change (C, 
D). OCT angiography of the deep vascular plexus shows dilated vessels feeding and draining the 2 central nodular fibrotic 
lesions (E), which had internal flow signals in the outer retina slab (F). Flow signals can be seen connecting the vascular 
structures within the 2 fibrotic nodules with the retinal vasculature (G, H), indicating a type 3 macular neovascularization 
(MNV). His visual acuity remained at 6/9.5 in the right eye with no anti-VEGF treatment.   14 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   been associated with peripapillary choroidal neovascular -
ization8 and MNV46,61,90,101,108,111,130,182,188 Several cases re-
ported the presence of subretinal fibrosis at presentation 
suggestive of a self-limiting natural history61,90 Other case 
reports demonstrated regression of MNV to a fibrotic scar 
with anti -VEGF therapy.46,108,130,182 Given the similar anato -
mical outcomes, it remains to be seen if anti -VEGF therapy is 
superior to observation. 
Dominant RPE65 -related chorioretinal dystrophy has been 
shown to develop MNV in 1 member of an Australian family 
harboring the RPE65 p.(Asp477Gly ) variant.140 The coin -
heritance of a BEST1 p.(Arg13Cys ) may have contributed to 
the formation of this stable MNV lesion over 4 years of ob-
servation. To date, only 10 cases of ungenotyped RP have 
been reported to develop MNV. Seven13,35,73,107,111 had type 2 
MNV, and 3 had type 3 MNV.2132,164 These cases were treated 
with laser photocoagulation,111 PDT,35 or anti -VEGF 
agents2,13,107,164 with variable visual outcomes. Type 2 MNV 
secondary to RP required between 1 and 5 injections during 
the first year,13,107 while type 3 MNV required 8–10 injec -
tions.3164 As previously discussed, MNV secondary to PRPH2 - related RP may require more intensive and ongoing use of 
anti -VEGF agents.125,137 Fig. 9 illustrates a case of dominant 
RP and an x-linked RP carrier with untreated MNV.  
4.4.  Iatrogenic MNV secondary to gene therapy 
Advancements in subretinal gene therapy hold promise for the 
stabilization and even reversal of some IRDs. Recent progress in 
clinical trials and regulatory approval of subretinal voretigene 
neparvovec gene therapy (Luxturna™ ) for RPE65 -associated re-
tinopathy requires clinicians to be aware of any potential com -
plications following these surgical procedures. Traumatic MNV 
has been reported with vitreoretinal surgery. Price and cow -
orkers150 documented a case of iatrogenic MNV developing 1 
month post Luxturna™ surgery. Intraoperatively, a small sub-
retinal hemorrhage was noted beneath the retinotomy site. 
Postoperatively, multimodal imaging was able to identify a break 
in Bruch membrane at the retinotomy site outside the macula 
region. Notably, the 16-year -old remained asymptomatic and the 
MNV regressed spontaneously without treatment. 
Fig. 8 – Optos imaging of a 58-year-old female choroideremia carrier showing diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (A) and large 
well-defined regions of RPE atrophy throughout the fundus (B). Near-infrared reflectance at baseline showed a central island 
of RPE remaining supporting a visual acuity of 6/7.5 (C). This small island reduced in size over 4 years (D) when she returned 
with a sudden reduction in vision to 6/15. OCT at baseline showed central preservation of the outer nuclear layers in the 
fovea (E). A subfoveal hyperreflective lesion developed 4 years later coinciding with acute vision loss (F). OCT angiography 
showed loss of the choriocapillaris outside the central RPE island (G) and a small speck of flow signal within the type 2 
macular neovascularization. This hyperreflective lesion resolved after 2 ranibizumab injections, and visual acuity was 
maintained at 6/12 without further injections for another 2 years.   15 SUR VEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY 69 (2023) 1–23   5.  Conclusions 
This review highlights the diverse phenotypic spectrum of 
IRD-related MNV and the clinical utility of multimodal ima -
ging including OCTA for the accurate diagnosis and mon -
itoring of treatment responses and documenting the natural 
history. To date, OCTA has enabled the detection, char -
acterization, and quantification of CNV size and facilitated an 
assessment of treatment responses in patients with IRDs 
despite their often distorted intraretinal and subretinal ar-
chitecture. Although the literature contains reports of spon -
taneous MNV regression, most have demonstrated the 
resolution of intraretinal fluid and SRF in response to in-
travitreal anti -VEGF treatment. Given the rarity of many IRDs, 
international collaboration is required to harness adequate 
sample sizes for randomized controlled trials examining structural and functional outcomes using well -defined treat -
ment protocols. Importantly, clinicians caring for IRD pa-
tients should consider the possibility of MNV development 
when patients present with acute visual loss and offer timely 
treatment with anti -VEGF to prevent irreversible changes.

Fig. 9 – Optos imaging of a 63-year-old male with genetically confirmed dominant retinitis pigmentosa characterized by bone 
spicules and white dots peripherally (A). Areas of hypoautofluorescent were seen in the mid-peripheral retina (B). OCT at 
baseline showed a PED with shallow subretinal fluid (C). Given the absence of recent visual decline, this was observed for 4 
years with stable visual acuity of 6/9.5. At the most recent visit, OCT angiography confirmed a stable type 1 macular 
neovascularization (MNV) (D) with normal deep retinal vascular plexus (E), a neovascular network within the outer retinal 
layer (F), and preserved choriocapillaris surrounding the type 1 MNV. Optos imaging of a 21-year-old female carrier with a 
history of x-linked retinitis pigmentosa showing subfoveal hemorrhage (H) and the typical tapetal-like reflex on fundus 
autofluorescence imaging (I). OCT at baseline showed thick subfoveal hyperreflective blood reducing visual acuity to 6/30. 
Angiography did not show leakage, and the patient returned 2 weeks later with OCT angiography showing a reduction in the 
submacular hemorrhage with no convincing flow signal within the nodular lesion arising from the RPE layer (K). After 7 
months of observation, the subretinal hemorrhage had resolved spontaneously but visual acuity only returned to 6/15
