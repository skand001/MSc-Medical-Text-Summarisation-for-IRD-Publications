Abstract: Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that include
retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and early-onset severe retinal
dystrophy (EO[S]RD), which differ in severity and age of onset. IRDs are caused by mutations in
>250 genes. Variants in the RPE65 gene account for 0.6–6% of RP and 3–16% of LCA/EORD cases.
Voretigene neparvovec is a gene therapy approved for the treatment of patients with an autosomal
recessive retinal dystrophy due to conﬁrmed biallelic RPE65 variants ( RPE65 -IRDs). Therefore,
the accurate molecular diagnosis of RPE65 -IRDs is crucial to identify ‘actionable’ genotypes—i.e.,
genotypes that may beneﬁt from the treatment—and is an integral part of patient management. To
date, hundreds of RPE65 variants have been identiﬁed, some of which are classiﬁed as pathogenic or
likely pathogenic, while the signiﬁcance of others is yet to be established. In this review, we provide
an overview of the genetic diagnostic workup needed to select patients that could be eligible for
voretigene neparvovec treatment. Careful clinical characterization of patients by multidisciplinary
teams of experts, combined with the availability of next-generation sequencing approaches, can
accelerate patients’ access to available therapeutic options.

1. Introduction
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of conditions that lead to a progressive
loss of vision and have a combined prevalence between 1:3000 and 1:4000 [ 1,2]. IRDs
are characterized by heterogeneity of genetic causes and phenotypic presentations [1,2].
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common IRDs [ 3]. In RP , the loss of photore-
ceptors, primarily in the peripheral retina, results in the appearance of pigment deposits
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22137207 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijmsInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 2 of 14
called bone spicules [ 4,5]. Depending on age at disease onset, severity, rate of progression
and presenting phenotype, the most common IRDs associated with severe visual impair-
ment in childhood are Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and early-onset severe retinal
dystrophy (EO[S]RD), characterized by severe visual loss from birth or early infancy, wan-
dering nystagmus, amaurotic pupils, and markedly reduced or non-recordable full-ﬁeld
electroretinograms [6,7].
Mutations in more than 250 different genes have been so far implicated as the cause
of IRDs [ 1,2,8]. Among the genes responsible for IRDs, RPE65 gene variants can cause RP
(RP20, OMIM # 613794) and LCA/EORD (LCA2, OMIM # 204100) [7,9,10].
The natural history of RPE65 -IRDs is variable, with a typical onset between birth and
ﬁve years of age [ 11,12]. Typically, patients with RPE65 -related IRD display a signiﬁcantly
altered visual behavior (light staring with profound nyctalopia, nystagmus) [ 7], severely re-
duced or nondetectable fundus autoﬂuorescence to 488 nanometers with relatively normal
fundus appearance [ 13], absent electroretinogram or a residual 30Hz ﬂicker response [ 14],
and a low hypermetropic or myopic refractive error [ 10]. While some patients have normal
or near-normal visual acuity (VA) at young ages, it becomes distinctly impaired in the
ﬁrst decade of life. VA then starts to deteriorate around 15–20 years of age, and declines
more quickly after the age of 20. In many patients, the VA worsens to the levels of legal
blindness (VA = 20/200) around the age of 16 years [ 12]. By the fourth decade, all patients
in this report are legally blind, and many have no light perception (complete loss of vision).
Milder disease phenotypes have been described in individuals with hypomorphic RPE65
alleles [ 15–18]. In particular, unusual phenotypic manifestations of biallelic RPE65 muta-
tions were detected in four families with fundus albipunctatus-like changes and in one
family with high hyperopia [19].
In the vast majority of cases, RPE65 -IRDs are autosomal recessive diseases. However,
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern has been proposed by some authors in a small
proportion of cases. [20–22].
In 2017, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna®, Spark Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA,
USA) gene therapy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of patients with conﬁrmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy
and viable retinal cells [ 23]. A year later, voretigene neparvovec was approved by the
European Medicines Agency for a similar indication: the treatment of adult and pediatric
patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by conﬁrmed biallelic
RPE65 variants and who have sufﬁcient viable retinal cells [24].
This article aims to review the evidence for the genetic basis of RPE65 -IRDs with a
particular focus on the most appropriate approaches to molecular testing of patients that
represent possible candidates for the RPE65 -gene supplementation therapy.
2. Epidemiology of RPE65 -IRDs
It is estimated that there are over 2.5 million individuals affected by IRDs world-
wide [ 25], with RP being the most common form. The prevalence of RP is approximately
1:4000 [ 3,26,27]. In particular, between 21% and 54% of IRD patients have RP [ 28,29]. On
the other hand, the prevalence of LCA/EORD ranges from 1:30,000 to 1:80,000 [ 10,30].
LCA/EORD accounts for approximately 5% of all IRDs, with reported numbers ranging
from 2.59% to 22% [28–30].
It is difﬁcult to accurately estimate RPE65 mutation prevalence rates, as previous
studies included different patient populations, initial diagnoses, or assessment methods,
and lack a common denominator (Table 1).Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 3 of 14

RPE65 variants are responsible for 0.8–1.5% of IRD cases [ 34,39,40]. In the US, the
frequency of people with RPE65 mutations was estimated to be 1:576,667, for a total
of 563 people with such variants at any given time, or seven new cases per year [ 32].
An analysis of genotype data from six major world populations predicted that there are
15,620 individuals with biallelic RPE65 mutations, and that more than 60% of these will be
from the African population [33].
RPE65 mutations account for approximately 0.6–6% of RP cases and for 3–16% of
LCA/EORD cases depending on the analyzed cohort [ 9,10,19,29,31,36–38,41,42]. The
largest European study on the epidemiology of IRDs, which analyzed the genetic land-
scape in a cohort of 6089 (4403 families) IRD patients in Spain, identiﬁed RPE65 mutations
in 3% of families with autosomal recessive RP [ 38]. One Italian study reported RPE65
variants in 8.4% of patients with LCA/EORD [ 31], which was higher than the published
prevalence of RPE65 mutations in patients with LCA/EORD from countries in Northwest-
ern Europe (1.7–6.1%) [ 6,43]. This could be because, in the Italian study, patients were
preselected for clinical characteristics of RPE65 -associated disease, namely the diagnosisInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 4 of 14
of LCA/EORD. Indeed, a later Italian study identiﬁed RPE65 mutations in 3.4% of IRD
patients [ 41], whilst the latest publication reported a 2% prevalence of RPE65 mutations
in patients with autosomal recessive RP [37]. According to the authors’ experience with a
vast collection of patients from across the country, biallelic RPE65 mutations account for
approximately 1–2% of all IRD patients referred for genetic testing in Italy, with 4–5 new
cases identiﬁed every year (unpublished data). Recently, the European Vision Institute
Clinical Research Network (EVICR.net) performed a multinational survey to understand,
amongst other issues, the distribution of RPE65 -IRDs in Europe. In this survey, three-
quarters of responding Italian centers reported following 1–5 patients with RPE65 -IRD and
one-quarter reported following a total of 6–10 patients [44].
3. Molecular Biology of RPE65
In humans, the RPE65 gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p31), spanning over
20 kb [26] .RPE65 includes 14 exons and encodes the retinal pigment epithelium-speciﬁc
65 kDa protein (RPE65) [ 45,46], denominated retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65 by the
current nomenclature. RPE65 consists of 533 amino acids [ 45]. It is a highly conserved
protein expressed at high levels exclusively in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [ 45].
There are two forms of RPE65, a membrane-bound form (mRPE65), a major form with
palmytoylation, and a soluble form (sRPE65) [ 45,47]. RPE65 is involved in the visual cycle,
a multi-step process through which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals
transmitted to the brain. When light reaches photosensitive pigments in the retina, it
converts 11- cis-retinal to all- trans -retinal. RPE65 is an isomerase that re-converts all- trans -
retinyl ester to 11- cis-retinol, ready for a new photoisomerisation event [ 45]. The absence
of RPE65 causes a decrease in 11- cis-retinol levels and the accumulation of retinyl esters in
the RPE [45].
4. Sequence Variants in the RPE65 Gene: An Overview
Only patients with biallelic mutations and viable photoreceptor cells are eligible
for gene therapy. Gene therapy procedure for RPE65 -IRDs involves bilateral vitrectomy
followed by subretinal injection [ 48]. Because of the risks associated with such a procedure,
it is important to establish the pathogenicity of the underlying mutations conclusively and
whether mutations are biallelic. Genetic diagnosis is critical to ensure that patients fulﬁl the
eligibility criteria for treatment [ 49]. A key scope of the genetic diagnostic workup in IRDs
is to identify which genotypes should be classiﬁed as pathogenic and, thus, ‘actionable’
(i.e., likely to respond to the approved gene supplementation therapy), a concept parallel to
that of ‘actionable’ mutations in cancer for which targeted therapies exist [ 50]. The presence
of many complex and uncertain variants underscores the importance of undertaking
exhaustive genetic screening.
4.1. Variants
RPE65 variants were ﬁrst linked to LCA/EORD in 1997 [ 51,52]. The heterogeneity
of variants encountered was immediately apparent with Gu et al. reporting ﬁve different
variations (a missense mutation [p.Pro363Thr], two point mutations affecting splicing and
two small re-arrangements [ 51]), and Marlhens and colleagues describing two mutations
(a single nucleotide deletion [c.1056delA] and missense mutation [p.Arg234*] [ 52]). Since
then, a myriad of variants has been discovered, the pathogenicity of which have not always
been established.
Parallel to variant discovery, variant classiﬁcation within the spectrum of clinical
signiﬁcance continues to evolve. In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics
and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology issued guidelines
that introduced standard terminology to group variants into ﬁve categories (“benign”,
“likely benign”, “uncertain signiﬁcance”, likely pathogenic”, “pathogenic”) and described
the process of category assignment based on the available evidence (e.g., population,
computational, functional, and segregation data) [53].Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 5 of 14
As of January 2021, more than 300 variations in the RPE65 gene are listed in the ClinVar
database [ 54], of which approximately 65 are considered pathogenic, 40 likely pathogenic,
and 100 of uncertain signiﬁcance. Most variations (>260) are single-nucleotide changes [ 54].
Of note, the sample represented in ClinVar may be biased in favor of pathogenic variations
since benign and likely benign variants are rarely reported in public databases. At the
same time, 206 RPE65 variations are listed in the Leiden Open Variation (LOV) Database,
102 of which classiﬁed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 29 as being of uncertain
signiﬁcance [ 55]. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) entry for RPE65 contains
120 synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 284 missense SNVs and 24 SNVs
marked as “putative loss-of-function” [56].
The variant prevalence and characteristics of RPE65 were evaluated in 2240 IRD
patients in a laboratory certiﬁed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments in the
USA [ 39]. Eighteen patients (0.8%) had RPE65 -associated disease, of which 12 (67%) had
at least one loss-of-function variant. Of the 35 variants identiﬁed in the study, two (5.7%)
copy number variants (CNV; one single exon deletion and one deletion of the entire RPE65
gene) were found [39].
While older studies reported no correlations between speciﬁc RPE65 genotypes and
phenotypes [ 57] or clinical course [ 58], a very recent study suggests that there is a rela-
tionship between mutation type and the age of disease onset [ 59]. Patients carrying two
missense alleles showed a later disease onset ( 1 year of age) than those with one or two
truncating variants (<1 year of age; Log Rank test p< 0.05) [59].
4.2. Variants of Uncertain Signiﬁcance Assessment
Variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) pose a serious challenge in determining the
eligibility to gene therapy in RPE65 -IRDs [ 48]. Nevertheless, Mahajan et al. reported no
correlation between variant subtype or ACMG classiﬁcation and treatment response. Seven
out of 29 patients from their series of patients with a conﬁrmed genetic diagnosis of biallelic
RPE65 gene variants had at least one VUS, and all of them, including three patients with
two VUSs, responded to gene supplementation therapy [60].
Different approaches can be deployed to assess the pathogenicity of a VUS in the
RPE65 gene. These include extended segregation studies, evaluation of the phenotype, in
silico tools to predict protein conservation and functionality, and in vitro functional studies.
Moreover, extended targeted or exome sequencing can be used to exclude the implication
of other IRD genes in disease etiology.
Segregation studies of all available relatives can be helpful in determining and re-
classifying the pathogenicity of VUSs. Extended segregation analysis showed that the
p.Phe83Leu and p.Gly187Glu VUS variants were found in families with IRDs: the former in
ﬁve LCA/EORD patients from four unrelated families and the latter in seven patients from
three unrelated families. Moreover, the two variants were more frequent in patients with
LCA/EORD than in patients with other IRDs. To further conﬁrm their pathogenicity, the
authors consulted eight gene variant databases and deployed 16 computational algorithms
to analyze the putative variant impact on protein functionality, 15 of which identiﬁed the
two variants as damaging. The overall classiﬁcation of p.Phe83Leu and p.Gly187Glu was
thus changed from VUS to likely pathogenic [61].
In the ACMG guidelines, a patient’s phenotype highly speciﬁc for the disease and a
ﬁtting family history in diseases with monogenic etiology was considered a supporting
criterion for classifying pathogenic variants (the PP4 criterion) [ 53]. The subsequent
guidelines published by the UK’s Association for Clinical Genomic Science state that in
some cases it may be appropriate to use PP4 at a moderate or strong level after excluding
that other genes are implicated [ 62]. In the case of RPE65 -IRDs, the identiﬁcation of a
compound heterozygous genotype with one VUS in a patient with a typical LCA/EORD
phenotype (as detailed in the Introduction) in the absence of any alternative genetic cause,
would be supportive of a VUS reclassiﬁcation to the ‘likely pathogenic’ category, especially,
in the presence of appropriate allele segregation and in silico prediction.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 6 of 14
In silico pathogenicity prediction tools are generally integrated into the bioinformatic
pipelines used for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic test-
ing. While useful, bioinformatic predictive methods (e.g., Polymorphism Phenotyping
v2 (PolyPhen2), Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), or Deleterious Annotation of
genetic variants using Neural Networks (DANN), to name just a few tools), and modeling
are not as signiﬁcant in clinical practice (for a detailed list of tools see Richards et al.,
2015 [ 53]). Philp and colleagues have developed and validated an algorithm termed “es-
timate of pathogenic probability” (EPP) that predicts the pathogenicity of VUS based on
its prevalence, segregation and predicted effects on protein structure [ 63]. In addition,
Iancu and colleagues have recently developed a strategy for the reclassiﬁcation of VUS
that considers ﬁve pathogenicity predictors, resulting in an algorithm able to correctly
reclassify approximately 70% of VUS as pathogenic in validation datasets [ 64]. The ACMG
algorithm has been updated to incorporate new evidence. Clearly, the classiﬁcation of VUS
is a dynamic process that will continue to change as new data are acquired, stressing the
importance of knowledge-sharing in the ﬁeld.
In vitro studies are only performed in a research setting because they are labor-
intensive and costly. They assess the consequences of mutations on protein abundance,
localization and function, as well as the impact of splice site variants. A minimal in vitro
visual cycle system in 293-F cells to assess the isomerization activity of RPE65 [65] com-
bined with in vitro mutagenesis was recently used to ascertain the pathogenicity of RPE65
VUSs prior to gene therapy. The results showed that the p.Gly104Val and p.Pro467Ser
protein VUSs were catalytically inactive; indeed, affected patients underwent treatment
and responded [ 48]. This example shows that enzymatic activity assessment in conjunction
with in vitro mutagenesis may be useful to determine the pathogenicity of VUSs.
4.3. Challenging RPE65-IRD Cases
Although RPE65 -IRDs are monogenic conditions, some authors have cautiously sug-
gested the possibility of a “double-hit” IRD etiology or a phenotype-modifying effect of
co-existing mutations [ 58]. More work is needed to conﬁrm or reject such a hypothesis and
to understand its impact on gene therapy eligibility.
To conﬁrm the phase of putative compound heterozygous variants, both for accurate
genetic counseling and, consequently, to conﬁrm eligibility for gene therapy, a segregation
analysis of proband’s parents is required. Some patients appear to have a homozygous
RPE65 mutation when ﬁrst tested. If the patient is homozygous for a known variant and
the phenotype points to an RPE65 etiology, the need for segregation may be, in principle,
less compelling. Nevertheless, segregation analysis of ‘homozygous’ variants is always
recommended for a comprehensive deﬁnition of the genotype. Apparent homozygosity
can be underlain by three scenarios: copy number variations leading to loss of heterozygos-
ity [39,66], uniparental isodisomy [ 67], or true homozygosity due to the existence of genetic
isolates, i.e., situations in which both parents carry the same mutation (more probable
in isolated locations with a degree of inbreeding or in consanguineous families such as
that described by [ 51]). Another possibility is that of encountering patients who carry
two variants in cisrather than in trans , i.e., on the same allele, with the other allele being
wild type. Such patients are not eligible for gene therapy for autosomal recessive diseases.
Segregation studies and haplotype resolutions using long reads are an approach of choice
to assign genetic variants to the homologous paternal and maternal chromosomes [68].
Clearly, the collaborative efforts of international networks of experts in IRD genetics
and the regular updating of public variant databases are highly recommended and will
signiﬁcantly contribute to VUS classiﬁcation and unsolved case interpretation.
5. Testing Strategy
Genetic testing is the only way to make an accurate diagnosis of RPE65 -IRD and
qualify the patient for gene therapy. The complexity of genetic testing can be addressed by
forming multidisciplinary teams of experts knowledgeable about IRD genetics and variantInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 7 of 14
interpretation to provide the best care for the patient. In Italy, and speciﬁcally in IRD genet-
ics expert laboratories, these teams commonly comprise molecular biologists, laboratory
technicians, and medical geneticists, and also include ophthalmologists, bioinformaticians,
molecular geneticists and genetic counsellors. In fact, to conﬁrm the pathogenic potential
of novel genes or variants, the diagnostic expert knowledge and basic science know-how
must be combined to resolve the genotype, even in the most complex cases. A genetic
diagnosis is necessary to fulﬁl the eligibility criteria as described in the recent consensus
paper by the Italian IRD Working Group [ 49]. The stepwise procedure we describe here
is a way of increasing genetic diagnostic sensitivity to assign a genetic diagnosis to most
patients as shown by Stone at al., 2017 [ 32]. Comprehensive genetic testing in rare eye
disorders (RED) is promoted by the ERN-EYE network, who emphasize the clinical need
and relevance of genetic testing in RED [69].
The choice of the testing strategy and the interpretation of variants are heavily in-
ﬂuenced by the information that the requesting clinician provides to the laboratory. The
clinician must communicate an accurate clinical diagnosis and pedigree information. Ide-
ally, the request for a genetic test should also be accompanied by the general anamnesis,
ocular anamnesis, including a description of retinal and extra-retinal clinical manifesta-
tions (indicative of a syndrome), the family pedigree showing affected family members
and pattern of inheritance, mention of consanguinity. This information will enable the
correct phenotype–genotype correlations to be made and will point towards syndromic or
non-syndromic disease.
Advances in technology allow for the detection of the underlying genetic cause in up
to 76% of patients with IRDs [ 32]. Genetic testing for RPE65 -IRDs can be performed by
Sanger sequencing, especially when NGS methodologies are not available. However, in
order to provide comprehensive testing, we believe it is necessary to include other IRD
genes [ 32]. This is particularly valid in patients with VUS or when assessing eligibility to
gene therapy [ 49]. In these cases, the extended panel sequencing is highly recommended.
Brieﬂy, targeted panel-based methods are fast and cheap, but, in the case of negative
ﬁndings, give no alternative genetic diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) allows
for the identiﬁcation of variants in all coding sequences and whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) anywhere in the genome, albeit they cost more and require longer and more difﬁcult
analysis than sequencing of a panel of genes.
In the clinical setting, a diagnostic laboratory must be certiﬁed, ﬁtted with the latest
equipment and experienced in state-of-art technologies (such as NGS, WES, multiplex
ligation probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA), or Sanger sequencing) to guarantee the quality of
diagnostic reports. The choice of test strategy also depends on the balance between cost,
turnaround time, coverage and data storage capacities. Most commonly, the frontline
technologies for accurate genetic diagnosis include an ocular NGS panel or clinical exome
sequencing (CES; also used to diagnose other conditions) followed by targeted in silico
analysis restricted to genes implicated in IRDs. The analysis of the remaining genes is
performed only when the “virtual ocular panel” yields no genetic diagnosis and has the
potential of discovering new genes responsible for the IRD phenotype. Such an approach
could even reduce the time needed for genetic testing, as there is no need to perform a new
sequencing but rather to re-analyze the already available data.
The standard turnaround time for targeted testing is around 3–4 months. In patients in
whom IRD-speciﬁc panels were used to no avail or in those with atypical phenotypes, the
strategy foresees the use of CES or WES [ 70], or CES followed by WES [ 71]. Instead, WGS
should be used in patients who have a phenotype that corresponds to a speciﬁc condition,
but in whom no mutations were detected in the genes previously identiﬁed as responsible
for that condition or those unresolved by WES [ 70,72]. For instance, in patients with a
single (‘monoallelic’) pathogenic variant in RPE65 and a convincing clinical picture (RP or
LCA/EORD), the sequencing of the entire gene is warranted to look for CNVs or complex
structural variants, SNVs in noncoding regions (UTRs, promoter and potential regulatory
elements), and deep-intronic (DI) variants. The number of cases with monoallelic RPE65Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 8 of 14
pathogenic variants is rather low, and this approach is mainly used in a research context.
On the contrary, DI variants constitute 2% of unique and 4% of all ABCA4 gene variants
implicated in the pathogenesis of another autosomal recessive IRD, Stargardt disease.
ABCA4 gene mutations being more common than those of RPE65 , it is not surprising that
the contribution of DI variants emerged more readily in the pathogenesis of Stargardt
disease [ 73]. As the costs and turnaround times of sequencing technologies decrease, and
if the capacity to interpret the functional consequences of noncoding variants increases,
the use of WGS in IRD diagnosis will become the method of choice in the clinical setting.
Results conﬁrmation is still performed by Sanger sequencing. The EVICR.net survey
shows that most responding centers in Europe use clinical-grade tests for diagnosing IRDs;
few combine clinical- and research-grade approaches. The most commonly deployed
methodologies were IRD-speciﬁc gene panels (67%), WES (49%) and diagnosis-directed
Sanger sequencing (41%). At present, 41–80% of the IRD patients are genetically solved in
69% of responding EVICR.net centers, and only 5% of the centers obtain a genetic diagnosis
in 81–100% of their IRD patients [74].
One drawback of NGS panels is that it is not usually possible to determine CNVs, for
which MLPA analysis should be used, particularly if extended segregation analysis is not
possible (e.g., the proband is an adopted single child). In a study of 677 individuals with
retinal dystrophy, indications of a deletion or duplication seen in NGS data were conﬁrmed
with MLPA, qPCR, or chromosome microarray [75].
Segregation analysis is a fundamental element of the genetic testing strategy as dis-
cussed in the section on Sequence variants. Therefore, it is important to acquire samples
from parents at the time of the proband’s genetic testing. Although up-front analysis
of three samples (trio analysis) rather than one increases the costs of testing, it may well
become a standard procedure as costs come down. Figure 1 summarizes a proposed genetic
diagnostic workup in RPE65 -IRDs.
With the advent of third-generation sequencing (TGS) based on the generation of
long reads, routine obtainment of reads of >10 kb became possible. Two technologies
play prominent roles on the market: single-molecule real-time sequencing known as
PacBio (Paciﬁc Biosciences) and nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Sequencing) [ 76].
While PacBio is based on recording ﬂuorescence events corresponding to single nucleotide
incorporation [ 77], nanopore sequencing measures ionic current changes when native
single-stranded nucleic acid molecule passes through a nanopore [ 78]. Long reads require
apposite analysis tools, a database of which has recently been created [ 76]. TGS is particu-
larly suitable for genome assembly studies and for the identiﬁcation of structural variants
(i.e., mutations that affect more than 50 base pairs), as reviewed in Xia and Zhou, 2020 [ 79]).
In the context of genetic testing in IRDs, TGS will contribute to the unravelling of orphan
cases (lack of segregation data) or in the above-mentioned cases of apparent homozygosity
to understanding the cis/trans allelic phase.
In the future, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) may speed up the genetic testing process,
improve the prediction of pathogenicity and the rate of resolved genetic diagnoses. AI
approaches in clinical genomics target tasks that are time-consuming and error-prone
using traditional methods. Accurate variant calling and classiﬁcation, genome annotation,
functional modelling, and phenotype-to-genotype correspondence—or perhaps future
genotype-to-phenotype prediction from genomic data alone—will increasingly be per-
formed using AI [ 80]. So far, deep neural networks have been used to successfully predict
the causative IRD gene in macular dystrophy caused by ABCA4 and RP1L1 gene aberration
compared with RP caused by EYS gene aberration and normal subjects from spectral
domain-optical coherence tomography data [ 34,81]. An increase in diagnostic yield will
ultimately improve the rates of patients’ inclusion in clinical trials that lead to the approval
of novel treatment options.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 9 of 14

6. Role of Genetic Counseling
Genetic counseling is deﬁned as “the process of helping people understand and
adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to
disease” [ 82]. Importantly, in addition to educating patients about the genetic aspects
of their condition, genetic counseling includes elements of psychotherapy [ 83]. Genetic
counseling appears to be effective in educating patients about their condition, providing a
greater sense of control and improving how patients assess and manage risk [84].Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 10 of 14
For patients with IRDs, genetic counseling beneﬁts from both experiences on eye
disorders and from an in-depth knowledge of genetic aspects. It is therefore highly rec-
ommended that genetic counsellors have experience in ocular genetics or work in multi-
disciplinary teams with expertise in the ﬁeld; in particular, counseling sessions conducted
jointly by an ophthalmologist and a medical geneticist should be advocated [74].
During genetic counseling scheduled prior to the test, patients have to grant informed
consent for testing upon acquiring in-depth knowledge on the range of possible outcomes,
the meaning and limitations of the test (such as the fact that in tests evaluating multiple
genes, not all variants have a unique interpretation and that testing can produce an uncer-
tain or unresolved outcome), logistical difﬁculties and waiting times. Also, implications for
the family must be explained, including inheritance pattern and the possibility of prenatal
diagnosis. Last but not least, counsellors have to address the issue of incidental ﬁndings,
especially when whole-exome/genome testing is planned. An in silico (virtual) NGS
panel approach excludes the possibility of incidental ﬁndings as only IRD genes are tested.
However, if WES or WGS sequencing is used and incidental ﬁndings are encountered, the
role of a genetic counsellor is crucial to address their consequences with patients and their
families. A number of factors may make patients resistant to genetic testing, including
ethical concerns, paternity issues, reluctance to involve family members and lack of infor-
mation. Some patients fear being told that there is no cure (not so in RPE65 -IRDs); there
may be irrational guilt in parents who feel responsible for passing on the disease, and fear
of a genetic disease and denial also play a role.
Communication with patients and their relatives is a delicate, albeit crucial, issue.
Healthcare professionals need to take adequate time for genetic counseling (an average
session lasts approximately 45 min) and patients have to feel free to talk about their ex-
pectations, voice their doubts and be able to contact the professional in case of necessity.
Sometimes several consultations are needed to enable patients to understand their condi-
tions, feel empowered and make informed decisions. As many RPE65 -IRD patients are
young children, talking to their parents/careers may prove harrowing for all participants
of a counseling session.
When test results are available, genetic counseling should concentrate on interpreting
the results obtained, such as variants relevant and not relevant to the phenotype, iden-
tiﬁcation of VUSs or unexpected diagnosis; in case of an uncertain result, the need for
further analysis and involving relatives may be described. Post-test genetic counseling also
discusses disease management (multidisciplinary care for syndromic patients) and thera-
peutic options, clinical trial inclusion, or the possibility of testing other family members. If
additional genetic workup is needed, the necessity of a further wait for a genetic diagnosis
must be raised. As segregation analysis is often a key element in molecular diagnosis,
patients with advanced IRDs and no family members for segregation analysis constitute a
particular challenge for both genetic testing and counseling.
7. Conclusions
Gene therapy is now available for the treatment of RPE65 -IRDs. Therapies speciﬁc
for other genotypes are being developed, and clinical trials of their safety and efﬁcacy
are underway [ 85]. Only patients with a sufﬁcient number of viable retinal cells can truly
beneﬁt from the therapy. Therefore, a timely and effective genetic testing strategy must be
implemented to identify patients eligible for gene therapy by adopting an exhaustive step-
wise procedure so that no patient is left without a genetic diagnosis. Furthermore, to ensure
the best outcomes for patients, genetic counseling programs should be implemented. As
phenotypes and genotypes frequently do not correlate, multidisciplinary teams involving
clinicians, geneticists, counsellors, diagnostic laboratories, and basic researchers should
form to study the relationships between them and to unravel the molecular/pathogenic
mechanisms of each variant to classify VUSs correctly. Frequent interaction, continuous
feedback, and collaboration will optimize patient management and maximize the beneﬁt
for patients from available treatments.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 7207 11 of 14
