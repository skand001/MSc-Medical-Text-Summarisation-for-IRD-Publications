Purpose: Current sequencing strategies can genetically solve
55–60% of inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) cases, despite
recent progress in sequencing. This can partially be attributed toelusive pathogenic variants (PVs) in known IRD genes, including
copy-number variations (CNVs), which have been shown as major
contributors to unsolved IRD cases.
Methods: Five hundred IRD patients were analyzed with targeted
next-generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS data were used todetect CNVs with ExomeDepth and gCNV and the results were
compared with CNV detection with a single-nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) array. Likely causal CNV predictions werevalidated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Results: Likely disease-causing single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)
and small indels were found in 55.6% of subjects. PVs in USH2A
(11.6%), RPGR (4%), and EYS(4%) were the most common. Likelycausal CNVs were found in an additional 8.8% of patients. Of the
three CNV detection methods, gCNV showed the highest accuracy.
Approximately 30% of unsolved subjects had a single likely PV in arecessive IRD gene.
Conclusion: CNV detection using NGS-based algorithms is a
reliable method that greatly increases the genetic diagnostic rate of
IRDs. Experimentally validating CNVs helps estimate the rate atwhich IRDs might be solved by a CNV plus a more elusive variant.

INTRODUCTION
Over 2 million people worldwide are affected by inherited
retinal degenerations (IRDs), a family of blinding diseasescharacterized by progressive death and dysfunction ofprimarily rod and cone photoreceptors.
1Pathogenic var-
iants (PVs) in over 270 genes have been associated withIRDs, many of which were discovered recently due toadvances in sequencing technologies.
2However, despite
substantial progress in genetic methodologies, current
strategies can genetically solve only about 55 –60% of IRD
cases.3–7The remaining missing diagnoses are in part due to
undiscovered IRD genes. However, PVs in each new diseasegene are rare,
2suggesting that the missing genetic causality
largely lies in the known IRD genes. Many of these elusivePVs are due to structural var iations (SVs) such as copy-
number variations (CNVs), or deep intronic variants thataffect splicing,
7–14which are not readily available from the
standard output of targeted next-generation sequencing
(NGS) pipelines.Our previous work analyzed 28 genetically unsolved
families with exome sequencin g (ES) and single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and/or c omparative genomic hybri-
dization (CGH) arrays, and showed that large deletions inknown IRD genes were responsible for disease in five of thefamilies.
14In this study we applied further bioinformatic
analyses that permit detection of CNVs on the panel-basedNGS Genetic Eye Disease (GEDi) diagnostic test thatinvolves sequencing the exons of all known IRD disease
genes.
3To assess the accuracy of CNV calling based on the
NGS read-depth we compared two algorithms, Exome-Depth
15and gCNV,16with the SNP array –based
approach.17A subset of the CNVs were subsequently
validated by quantitative poly merase chain reaction (qPCR).
In addition, we specifically searched for the Alu transpo-
sable element insertion in MAK , which is a common cause
of IRD in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.18,19Applying
these techniques improved the genetic diagnostic rate for
IRD patients by 10.2%.

Ethical guidelines
The study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Massachusetts Eye and Ear (Human Studies Committee,MEE, USA) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all individualson whom genetic testing and further molecular evaluations
were performed.
Clinical evaluation
Patients included in the study were recruited and clinically
examined at MEE. Ophthalmic examination included best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, dynamic Goldmann visualfield testing, dark adaptation testing, and full-field electro-retinographic (ERG) testing with assessment of 0.5 Hz ERG
amplitude and 30 Hz ERG amplitudes.
Genomic DNA extraction and targeted sequencing
DNA was extracted from venous blood using the DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All samplesunderwent Genetic Eye Disease test (GEDi) sequencing asdescribed previously.
3The GEDi version used in this study
included 266 genes known to be associated with monogenic
inherited retinal degenerations2,3(Supplementary Table S5).
The capture libraries were sequenced on MiSeq (9 samples perrun) or HiSeq (96 samples per run) NGS platforms (Illumina,San Diego, CA) as previously described.
3The NGS data were
analyzed using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) version 3(https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/ ) and annotated
using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool ( https://useast.
ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/ ) with additional annotations
taken from gnomAD Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling
(GERP), SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and retinal expression.
20Rare
variants were selected based on the minor allele frequency(MAF) in public databases of less than 0.3%. Dominantpathogenic variants were considered with MAF <0.01%.Variants were annotated based on the transcripts included inSupplementary Table S5.
Exon 15 of RPGR transcript NM_001034853 (called RPGR
ORF15) is not fully covered by the NGS and therefore it was
PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced with previouslyestablished protocols (Supplementary Methods).
CNV analysis
NGS read-depth analysis
Copy-number variation from NGS read-depth was inferred
using ExomeDepth15and gCNV from the GATK version 4.16
Samples from all MiSeq runs were processed together(193 samples), and HiSeq runs were analyzed separately(batches of 96 or 48 samples). For ExomeDepth, the sampleswere separated by gender; for gCNV, they were kept together.For gCNV, the GEDi-captured regions were padded by 250 bpon each side and run in COHORT mode without externalcontrol samples. CNVs present in more than 15% of sampleswere removed as they were considered to be either capture
artifacts or common CNVs that would not lead to a rareMendelian disorder. CNVs in the OPN1LW gene and the
OPN1MW gene were removed as they were likely artifacts of
poor NGS read mapping quality.
SNP array
Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples from probands wereanalyzed with whole-genome SNP microarray (Huma-
nOmni2.5 BeadChip, Illumina) according to the manufac-
turer ’s instructions. The hybridized SNP arrays were analyzed
using an array reader (iScan array scanner, Illumina) and theSNP calls were made with the genotyping module of the dataanalysis software (GenomeStudio, Illumina). Copy-numbervariation from the SNP array results was detected withPennCNV using default parameters and sex information.

CNV confirmation
Quantitative real-time PCR
Deletions were validated using quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR) on gDNA with primers specific to sequences inside thepresumed CNV and flanking the CNV (SupplementaryTable S1). The amplification was normalized to the ZNF80
reference gene. For each qPCR reaction 5 ng of gDNA, 200 nMof each primer and 10 µl of Fast SYBR Green master mix (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used. The amplification
was performed in a qPCR system (Stratagene Mx3000P ®,
Agilent Technologies) using the standard thermocyclingprogram: 95 °C for 3 minutes, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20seconds, 60 °C for 1 minute followed by a melting curve. Eachsample was assayed in triplicate. Relative changes in genomicsequence abundance were calculated using the 2
−ddC
Tmethod,
and error was calculated using standard propagation of errors.
Data was visualized using custom R scripts.

material.
RESULTS
A cohort of 500 unrelated IRD patients was sequenced with
the targeted NGS panel Genetic Eye Disease test (GEDi)3and
analyzed with a comprehensive approach, which included astandard NGS analysis pipeline detecting single-nucleotidevariants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels),
16
interrogation of sequence reads to detect the knownpathogenic MAK -Alu insertion,
21and application of NGS
read-depth algorithms (ExomeDepth15and gCNV16) to detect
larger deletions and duplications, or CNVs (Fig. 1). In this
study we define CNVs as deletions or duplications that range
from an average size of an exon ( ≈50–200 bp) and that are not
detectable by standard NGS pipelines, to megabases ofDNA.
22
The integrated analytical approach yielded pathogenic
SNVs/small indels likely leading to disease in 278 IRDsubjects (55.6% of the total cohort), where PVs in USH2A
(11.8%), RPGR (4%), and EYS (4%) were the most common
causes of disease (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2). InARTICLE ZAMPAGLIONE et al1234567890():,;
1080 Volume 22 |Number 6 |June 2020 |GENETICS in MEDICINEaddition, MAK-Alu insertion was detected in seven patients
by analyzing the NGS sequence reads.21
CNV predictions using NGS data
In our initial CNV analysis we focused only on CNVs thatwould contribute to solving the case genetically, that is (1)
homozygous CNVs in autosomal recessive (ar) genes, (2)
heterozygous CNVs in ar genes that are in trans with likely
causal SNVs or small indel in the same gene, (3) compoundheterozygous CNVs in ar genes, (4) heterozygous CNVs in ahaploinsufficiency gene, and (5) duplications in autosomaldominant genes, which could lead to gain-of-functionvariants. Applying these criteria resulted in 55 patients with65 potentially disease-causing CNVs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These CNVs were subsequently validated by qPCR using
gDNA from patients and healthy controls. qPCR confirmedthe likely CNV solutions for a total of 46 CNVs in 44 patients(8.8% of the total cohort). Thirty-two of them carriedheterozygous deletions, four carried homozygous deletions,three hemizygous deletions, and five carried heterozygousduplications. Only one of the patients carrying a homozygousdeletion (OGI2860_004445) was reported to be from a
consanguineous marriage. CNVs in PRPF31 (10), EYS (9),
andUSH2A (8) were the most common (Fig. 2b, Supple-
mentary Table S3).
CNV case highlights
Most of the CNVs detected in this project were easilyinterpretable as they were either homozygous deletions,heterozygous deletions coupled with a deleterious allele in trans ,
or heterozygous deletions in the known haploinsufficiency genePRPF31 .

CNV contributions to disease e tiology, which we highlight
below.
In two patients we detected two nonconsecutive hetero-
zygous deletions, which are thought to be due to deletions intrans (e.g., EYS deletions in subject 121 –182 [simplex RP], or
PCDH15 deletions in subject OGI635_001299 [Usher syn-
drome], Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S1). Unfortunately,due to lack of samples from family members and a largedistance between the deletions (0.86 and 0.51 Mb), the phaseof these deletions could not be confirmed.
Subject OGI655_001331 carried a heterozygous deletion of
almost the entire ABCA4 gene (exons 1 –40). On closer
examination, it was revealed that the same subject also carried
a common hypomorphic missense change p.Asn1868Ile,
which due to its high allele frequency (AF =0.042 in
gnomAD) was overlooked during the initial analysis. Thep.Asn1868Ile missense in trans with a deleterious missense
variant or loss-of-function allele was shown to lead to a lateonset macular degeneration,
24which corresponds to the
disease presentation in OGI655_001331, diagnosed withinherited macular degeneration/Stargardt disease at age 42.
We identified five duplications (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Table S3). We were able to confirm the breakpoints of twotandem duplications in OFD1 andADGRV1 (Fig. 3, Table S3),
and tandem duplication in RPGRIP1 was confirmed pre-
viously.
25Tandem duplications in ADGRV1 and RPGRIP1
will lead to frameshifts and loss-of-function alleles. However,a tandem duplication of exons 6 –15 in OFD1 in a male subject
OGI2829_004414 will likely lead to an inframe duplication of
1242 internal coding bases (414 amino acid residues), with

Subject OGI2829_004414 presented with a ciliopathy pheno-type (retinal degeneration, history of kidney disease, andpossible cognitive dysfunction).
Despite multiple attempts we were not able to confirm the
breakpoints of duplications in EYS and JAG1 , therefore
considering them as tandem duplications is an assumption.
Subject OGI2839_004424 carried a heterozygous duplication
of exons 1 –25 (3199 coding base-pairs) in JAG1 gene, which is
predicted to cause a frameshift leading to a loss-of-functionallele. Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in JAG1 are
known to lead to Alagille syndrome through haploinsuffi-ciency of this gene.
27The major clinical features of Alagille
syndrome are abnormalities in bile ducts leading to liverdamage and accompanying features are congenital heart
defects, vertebrae anomalies, and ocular defects including
pigmentary retinopathy and optic disc drusen.
28Investigation
of the clinical notes revealed that subject OGI2839_004424was seen in the ophthalmic clinic for the retinopathy, but inaddition was previously diagnosed with Alagille syndrome,therefore we consider the JAG1 duplication as the likely cause
of the disease.
Comparison of NGS-based CNV predictions versus SNP
array –based CNV predictions
To determine if SNP array –based detection of CNVs could
replicate the findings from our NGS-based CNV analysis, weanalyzed a subset of our cohort with the Illumina Omni 2.5SNP array using the PennCNV algorithm.
17Of the 500 sam-
ples from the NGS cohort, 144 were chosen for SNP arrayanalysis. In these 144 samples, there were 61 predicted solving
CNVs by gCNV and ExomeDepth in 52 patients (three of thesamples from the initial NGS-based CNV analysis were not
analyzed by the SNP array, thus not included in thecomparison). The remaining 92 patients were chosen fromthe pool of samples that did not have likely solving NGS-based CNV or SNV predictions. These samples were chosento see if there were any potentially solving CNVs predictedby the SNP array that were missed by NGS-based methods. Inthese 144 samples, gCNV predicted 52 potentially solving
CNVs, ExomeDepth predicted 52 potentially solving CNVs,
and SA predicted 31 potentially solving CNVs, including fourCNVs in three patients that were not predicted by NGS-basedmethods. All predicted solving CNVs were then tested byqPCR to determine if they were confirmed true positives(Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig. S1A, B). Of the three methods
used, gCNV showed the best performance with 44 of 52predictions that validated compared with ExomeDepth (37/
52) and SNP array (25/31). The gCNV algorithm alone
predicted all of the true positive CNVs detected in this study(Fig. 4a). False positive rate was the highest (29%) in
ExomeDepth (Fig. 2b).
Depending on the technique used, the predicted sizes of the
validated CNVs ranged from 59 bp to 249 kb (ExomeDepth),619 bp to 249 kb (gCNV), and 2.2 kb to1.6 Mb (SNP array)(Fig. 4c). Since NGS-based methods only investigate regions
covered by the capture kit (i.e., IRD gene exons), and the SNP
array covers the genome in a more uniform fashion, the sizesof large CNVs predicted are probably more accuratelyrepresented by the SNP array. This is because with NGS-based methods, any CNV that overlaps coding regions, butstarts or ends in a noncoding region, can only be reported asthe size of the coding regions plus any intervening introns. Inthis study, we did not attempt to map all the CNV
breakpoints; however, we validated the CNVs with multiple

thus chromosome coordinates of reported CNVs should beconsidered minimum estimates of the CNV size (Supplemen-tary Fig. S1).
Further, we wanted to investigate why the SNP array failed
to detect 19 true CNVs that were predicted by gCNV. Themost plausible reason is that the CNV is not covered by asufficient number of SNPs on the array because it is too small
or it is in a region that is poorly represented on the array.
First, we compared the sizes of the CNVs predicted by gCNVthat were validated by the SNP array (SA +ve) and that were
not validated by the SNP array (SNP-ve) (Fig. 4d). As
expected CNVs that were not predicted by the SNP array wereon average smaller (median =772 bp, mean =6.5 kb) than
the CNVs that were also validated by the array (median =17
kb, mean =49 kb). None of the 12 CNVs that were below 1 kb
had sufficient number of SNPs (at least three) on the Omni2.5array to be detected by this method. Of the remaining seven
larger CNVs (~7 –44 kb) that were not detected by the SNP
array, most had sufficient number of SNPs in the interval(Supplementary Table S3), therefore, failure to detect them bythe SNP array was due to other undetermined experimental oranalytical reasons.
Assessment of gCNV prediction scores
In the original analysis of the gCNV output we did not applyany quality filters, as the primary constraint on the data waswhether a CNV fulfilled our “potentially solving ”criteria.
Considering only gCNV predictions, there were 55 CNVs thatwe attempted to validate by qPCR. Of the 46 CNVs that didvalidate, we noticed that some of them had low qualitymetrics. However, an agnostic search for true positive CNVsrequires quality filters to remove false predictions, even at the
expense of throwing out true positives. Therefore, we

GENETICS in MEDICINE |Volume 22 |Number 6 |June 2020 1083reanalyzed all CNVs in the cohort without the constraint of
needing to be “potentially solving ”, in order to look for CNVs
that may be true structural variants that are not primarycontributors to disease, or potential single hit disease-causing
CNVs in genes that should be investigated further. This
resulted in 3811 predicted CNVs in 500 patients, before anythresholds were applied. As an initial quality filter, weremoved CNV predictions that were present in greater than15% of samples and CNVs from the opsin gene locus onchromosome X, which due to poor NGS mapping qualitygenerated a high rate of likely false positive CNVs. Thisreduced the number of predicted CNVs in the cohort to 759,
and still included all 55 CNVs investigated by qPCR. By
plotting the distribution of quality score metrics of these 759CNVs, and highlighting the qPCR validated CNVs, wecompared the different quality score metrics generated bygCNV (Fig. 5) to choose one for a quality score cutoff. We
settled on using the score of QA >30.
16This cutoff reduced
the number of CNVs in the entire cohort to 179 CNVs in 117patients, which included 3 of 9 falsely predicted CNVs and
missed 3 of 46 true positive predictions (Fig. 5).Assessment of frequency of patients with single likely
pathogenic alleles in a recessive IRD gene
To assess how likely it is that the remaining genetically
unsolved patients carry elusive pathogenic variants in alreadyknown IRD genes, we first evaluated how many unsolvedpatients have known pathogenic variants or new loss-of-function variants in recessive IRD disease genes, includingCNVs. Of the 171 unsolved subjects, 44 carried stop,
frameshift, essential splice-site variants or likely pathogenic
CNVs and four subjects carried known pathogenic missensealleles (Supplementary Table S4). Altogether, we estimatedthat at least 28% of the unsolved patients (9.6% of the overallcohort) carried a single likely pathogenic allele in a recessiveIRD gene.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that CNVs contribute significantly to thegenetic causality of IRDs, and that NGS-based CNV detectionmethods outperform SNP array –based CNV detection. Of the
500 unrelated patients whose genetic cause of disease wasinvestigated by panel-based NGS testing (GEDi),
3likely
disease-causing CNVs were identified in 8.8% of cases. In55.6% of cases the disease could be explained by the likelypathogenic SNVs and small indels detected by the standard
NGS analysis pipeline.

Fig. 5 Distribution of gCNV quality metrics for rare, nonopsin copy-
number variations (CNVs). The gCNV algorithm provides four quality
metrics for every predicted CNV: QA, QS, QSE, and QSS. QA is the com-
plementary Phred-scaled probability that all points (i.e., targets or bins) inthe segment agree with the segment copy-number call. QS is the com-
plementary Phred-scaled probability that at least one point (i.e., target or
bin) in the segment agrees with the segment copy-number call. QSE is thecomplementary Phred-scaled probability that the segment end position is agenuine copy-number changepoint. QSS is the complementary Phred-
scaled probability that the segment start position is a genuine copy-number
changepoint. Violin plots show the relative probability density of the dis-tribution of each quality metric, while internal box plots show the 25th,median, and 75th percentile of distribution. The red and black data points
represent CNVs within the distribution that were experimentally determined
to be either true positives (black) or false positives (red) by quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validation.ARTICLE ZAMPAGLIONE et al

MAK ,18,19,21which was present in 1.4% of cases, agreeing
closely with the previously reported frequency of 1.2%.18
The majority of the CNVs were heterozygous or homo-
zygous deletions, ranging from single-exon to whole-genedeletions. Three large deletions in two genes ( MERTK and
TRPM1 ) were in regions prone to the nonallelic homologous
recombination (NAHR), which is the most likely mechanism
of their occurrence.
14Analysis of all CNVs reported in IRD
genes performed by Van Schil and colleagues indicated thatgene size, followed by the number of LINE and LTR repeats isthe biggest predictor for a gene to be prone to CNVs.
29This
analysis correlates well with our findings, where the largestIRD gene EYS and the third largest IRD gene USH2A , had
nine and eight causal CNVs respectively. However, in the
present study the most common gene to harbor CNVs was
PRPF31 , which is known to cause a dominant form of IRD
through haploinsufficiency.
23Even though PRPF31 is known
to be prone to CNVs, their contribution to IRD causality islikely still underestimated. A literature search by Van Schiland colleagues revealed that causal CNVs in PRPF31 have
been reported in 14 families, and the Human Gene MutationDatabase (HGMD) reports 35 SVs of the total of 196 variants
(18%). In this study we detected likely causal CNVs in 10 of
22 (45%) probands with PRPF31 -related disease, demonstrat-
ing a higher than previously reported CNV rate in this gene.The reasons for such high frequency of CNVs in PRPF31 is
unclear, since this gene is neither large (~16.3 kb genomiclength) nor does it have a high density of long interspersed-nuclear elements (LINE) and long terminal repeat (LTR)elements (ranked 191 of 245 genes by Van Schil and
colleagues).
29
Our study highlights the importance of parallel SNV and
CNV analyses, as certain variants may falsely appear ashomozygous when in fact they are in trans with a large
deletion. This distinction is particularly important when ahypomorphic variant is involved, as in the case ofp.Asn1868Ile in ABCA4 discovered in trans with a large
deletion in subject OGI655_001331. The p.Asn1868Ile variant
in a homozygous state is not considered pathogenic; however,
when paired in trans with a severe pathogenic variant it has
been shown to be causal.
24This finding also demonstrates the
importance of evaluating every variant, rather than prema-turely discarding variants based on certain criteria. This isbecoming more feasible with the emergence of software thatcan rank variants, based on human-designed or machinelearning algorithms.
Of 44 patients with CNVs, only five carried likely causal
duplications, which may be an underestimate, as duplicationsare more difficult to detect, interpret, and validate. All but oneof the duplications are thought to result in a loss-of-functionallele. Duplication of OFD1 exons 6 –15 is predicted to
duplicate 414 internal amino acids of the protein and lead to apartially functioning OFD1 protein, resulting in a decreasedspectrum of disease in subject OGI2829_004414, who apart
from retinal disease has a history of renal failure. Variants inOFD1 may lead to a spectrum of phenotypes from an
X-linked dominant oral –facial –digital type 1 syndrome, with
ciliopathy phenotype in females and embryonic lethal inmales, X-linked recessive Joubert syndrome to nonsyndromicIRD, depending on where the variant is located;
8,26,30
however, to our knowledge no causal duplications in OFD1
have been reported to date.
NGS-based CNV prediction with the gCNV algorithm
showed considerable advantage over more traditional SNParray –based prediction. This is largely because NGS-based
algorithms could detect smaller CNVs as they were notrestricted by the availability of SNPs. In our study, allvalidated CNVs detected by the SNP array were also detectedby gCNV, therefore this method is an adequate replacementof the SNP array –based CNV predictions. Another accurate
method of CNV detection is a customizable microarray-based
comparative genomic hybridization, e.g., IRD genes array(arrEYE).
11However, this method requires an additional wet-
lab assay to be applied to the samples that had alreadyundergone NGS, which may be unnecessary if the CNVs canbe detected by a robust NGS-based algorithm. In this study weused qPCR on gDNA as a validation of the CNVs, as this is acost-effective and easily accessible method widely applied in
many labs; however, other assays such as targeted locus
amplification
29or genome sequencing can be applied with an
added benefit of mapping CNV breakpoints.31
In a genetic diagnostic setting, filtering based on CNV
prevalence in the cohort, CNV frequency per sample, andgCNV quality scores will aid in assessing the likelihood of agiven CNV being true positive. In this study, we usedexperimental results to establish thresholds on gCNV
predictions to reduce predicted CNVs to a subset with a
higher probability of being true genetic variants. In futurestudies, more sophisticated methods can be used, such ascreating a scoring method that considers multiple factors,similar to the guidelines recommended for sequence variantcuration from the American College of Medical Genetics andGenomics (ACMG).
32Taking into account the population-
level frequency of CNVs using publicly available data sets will
also be crucial in establishing the pathogenicity of the CNVs
(e.g., gnomadSV, Collins et al., bioRXiv preprint).
In conclusion, our rate of discovery for likely solving
variants in IRD patients has increased from 55.6% to 65.8% byincluding information from CNVs and MAK -Alu insertions.
This represents a significant improvement in solving geneticcases, consistent with or higher than in previous stu-dies.
11,12,33–35Additional analysis found 9.6% of the cohort
had a single potentially pathogenic SNV or CNV in a known
autosomal recessive IRD gene. Although this does notconstitute enough evidence to identify that gene as disease-causing, it indicates a high chance that an elusive pathogenicvariant resides on the second allele, as demonstrated beforefor the RPGRIP1 gene.
25Searching for these elusive variants is
critical for improving the discovery rate of disease causation.For example, this study did not investigate other SVs such as
inversions. translocations, and other complex rearrangementsZAMPAGLIONE et al ARTICLE
GENETICS in MEDICINE |Volume 22 |Number 6 |June 2020 1085including mobile element insertions, which may play an
important role in IRDs.36,37There are also examples of deep
intronic variants leading to splicing aberration and untrans-lated region (UTR) variants contributing to retinal dis-ease.
8,9,25,38,39The development of assays that can confirm
pathogenic contributions from such variants, and theirinclusion into variant analysis pipelines, will be important
for better understanding the genetic contributions not just to
IRDs, but to Mendelian disorders in general.
