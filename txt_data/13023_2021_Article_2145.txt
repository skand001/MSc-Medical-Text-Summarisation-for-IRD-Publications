Abstract 
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a diverse group of degenerative diseases of the retina that can lead to significant 
reduction in vision and blindness. Because of the considerable phenotypic overlap among IRDs, genetic testing is a 
critical step in obtaining a definitive diagnosis for affected individuals and enabling access to emerging gene ther -
apy–based treatments and ongoing clinical studies. While advances in molecular diagnostic technologies have signifi-
cantly improved the understanding of IRDs and identification of disease-causing variants, training in genetic diagnos-
tics among ophthalmologists is limited. In this review, we will provide ophthalmologists with an overview of genetic 
testing for IRDs, including the types of available testing, variant interpretation, and genetic counseling. Additionally, 
we will discuss the clinical applications of genetic testing in the molecular diagnosis of IRDs through case studies.

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogenous 
group of visually debilitating diseases caused by patho -
genic variation in proteins critical to retinal function. The 
majority of IRDs are characterized by retinal degenera -
tion, which can lead to significant vision impairment and 
blindness [1–4]. Collectively, IRDs are estimated to affect 
more than 2 million people worldwide [5, 6]. Because of 
the phenotypic overlap of several IRDs, establishing a 
definitive clinical diagnosis may be difficult [7]. There -
fore, molecular genetic testing has become an important 
strategy to complement clinical findings and confirm or 
clarify a diagnosis.
With an increased understanding of the human 
genome and the wide scope of genetic variants identi -
fied to be associated with IRDs (> 250 causative genes) 
[8], emerging genetic testing technologies such as next-
generation sequencing are allowing clinicians to better diagnose IRDs [9–11]. The advent of these sophisticated 
testing technologies for genetic disorders has highlighted 
the need for broader awareness of human genetics and its 
relevance to personalized medicine in IRDs.
The American Academy of Ophthalmology Task Force 
on Genetic Testing and the European Reference Network 
for Rare Eye Diseases recommend genetic testing for all 
individuals with presumed or suspected IRDs for which 
a causative gene or genes have been identified [12, 13]. 
However, most clinical ophthalmologists are unfamil -
iar with genomic diagnostics. In a retrospective analysis 
of genetic testing utilization for individuals with IRDs 
within a large, university-based health system conducted 
from 2008 to 2018, providers felt that genetic testing was 
useful in IRD management [14]. However, the analy -
sis found that genetic testing was infrequently utilized, 
with only 1.5% of 207 individuals with IRDs undergoing 
genetic testing ordered from an ophthalmologist’s office 
[14].
Historically, genetic testing has been ordered and inter -
preted by IRD specialists and ocular genetic counselors 
at large academic research centers [12]. However, this 
structure does not adequately meet patient demand for Open Access

3 major reasons. First, there are not enough IRD spe -
cialists and ocular genetic counselors at academic medi -
cal centers to meet patient demand for genetic testing. 
While there are currently close to 5000 certified genetic 
counselors in the United States, < 1% of them have exper -
tise in ophthalmology [15]. Second, many individuals 
with IRDs are geographically isolated from those cent -
ers and unable or unwilling to travel. It is important for 
affected individuals to be evaluated by a retina special -
ist who is familiar with IRDs and has the expertise to 
make a provisional clinical diagnosis. Community-based 
retina specialists have successfully incorporated genetics 
into their practice by ordering testing themselves; how -
ever, the importance of both pre- and post-test genetic 
counseling should be recognized. Particularly in the 
United States, telemedicine-based genetic counseling 
services are becoming more widely available to support 
geographically or economically disadvantaged individu -
als in accessing specialists in ocular genetics [16]. This 
allows community-based retina specialists to partner 
with telephone-based genetic counselors to help disclose 
results to individuals and manage conversations regard -
ing complex results and risks to family members. Lastly, 
the global use of genetic testing is limited because of 
the challenge for the budgets and structure of regional 
healthcare systems to cover the cost of genetic testing, 
particularly in countries with low resources [13].
Early and accurate diagnosis is necessary for individu -
als with IRDs to enable patient decision-making, to iden -
tify suitable clinical studies or treatment opportunities, 
and to improve patient outcomes. The objective of this 
review is to provide a general understanding of genetic 
testing and its clinical applications for IRDs through case 
studies.
Genetic testing
Genetic testing is the analysis of an individual’s DNA to 
detect genetic changes or variants that could lead to dis -
ease [17]. With the application of improved molecular 
testing technology, the likelihood of identifying a causa -
tive variant in individuals with IRDs has increased [10, 
11, 18–20]. Identifying the disease-causing variant can 
not only illuminate or confirm a diagnosis but can also 
improve medical management by informing progno -
sis, reducing the need for additional electrophysiologic 
testing, clarifying guidance in ocular surveillance, and 
advising appropriate changes in therapies and/or supple -
mentation [19]. Genetic testing also allows for accurate 
identification of inheritance pattern, thereby improv -
ing genetic counseling for affected individuals and their 
families [19]. Additionally, with an approved retinal gene 
therapy for biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated reti -
nal dystrophy,  Luxturna® (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) [21, 22], and several ocular gene therapy clinical studies 
in progress [23–25], confirming a molecular diagnosis 
through genetic testing may help individuals access the 
latest treatment options or qualify for study participation 
[2, 7].
When a person has been clinically diagnosed with a 
presumed IRD, diagnostic genetic testing is indicated. At 
this time, genetic testing should not be used to rule out 
an IRD, since a negative result from large panel genetic 
tests could reflect the limits of the panel’s design and not 
the comprehensive spectrum of potential genetic can -
didates [12]. In many cases, diagnostic testing is recom -
mended on the basis of physical symptoms or findings 
from clinical examination. If an individual is asympto -
matic but a disease-causing molecular variant has previ -
ously been confirmed in a family member, genetic testing 
can be used for predictive testing or carrier testing [26]. 
Predictive testing is used to detect genetic mutations in 
individuals before they present with symptoms to assess 
future risk of disease [12, 26]. When no therapeutic inter -
vention exists, predictive testing should be approached 
with caution, particularly in children. For many IRDs, 
reduced penetrance or a wide degree of variability in clin -
ical symptoms is known to occur and can complicate the 
interpretation of results for asymptomatic individuals. 
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genom -
ics and the American Academy of Pediatrics explicitly 
discourage the routine testing of at-risk minors for adult-
onset conditions with no available therapy or change in 
management [27]. Carrier testing is used to identify indi -
viduals who carry a single pathogenic variant in a reces -
sive or X-linked disease gene that, when present with 
another pathogenic variant, can cause genetic disease. 
Carrier testing may be performed on individuals who do 
not present with symptoms but may be at risk for passing 
a genetic disease on to their children [26].
Genetic tests can assess single genes or, more com -
monly, panels of genes associated with a group of genetic 
diseases [2]. Previously, genetic testing was primarily per -
formed on a single-gene basis, where the small number 
of genes tested were those determined to be most likely 
associated with disease on the basis of clinical assessment 
[7, 19, 28]. This often produced a low diagnostic yield [7]. 
While traditional single-gene sequencing may be suffi -
cient for diagnosing IRDs with mostly only one disease-
associated gene identified, such as congenital anirdia 
(PAX6 gene), systematic testing of single genes may be 
inefficient for diagnosing more complex IRDs that have a 
high degree of genetic heterogeneity, such as retinitis pig -
mentosa (> 100 identified causative genes) [2, 7, 8, 12, 19, 
29]. With the introduction of next-generation sequenc -
ing, testing multiple genes in a single assay has become 
possible [9]. Next-generation sequencing sequences Page 3 of 9

millions of DNA fragments in parallel and matches them 
to a reference genome using bioinformatics to detect var -
iants [30, 31]. Next-generation sequencing can be used to 
completely sequence an individual’s DNA (whole genome 
sequencing) or to sequence just the protein-coding 
regions (whole exome sequencing) [30–32]. In the clini -
cal assessment of IRDs, next-generation sequencing can 
also be used to constrain sequencing to just the coding 
regions of genes known to cause retinal diseases using a 
targeted multigene panel [30, 31].
In the processing of genetic test results, identified vari -
ants are analyzed to determine their potential association 
with an IRD phenotype. Not all identified variants cause 
disease [33]. Genetic variant interpretation, as defined 
by the American College of Medical Genetics, is clas -
sified using a 5-class system (Table  1) [33, 34]. Variants 
may be classified as benign on the basis of several crite -
ria, including well-established functional data showing 
no damaging effect of the variant on protein function 
or splicing, lack of segregation in affected members of a family, and variant frequency in the general population 
[34]. Variants classified as “likely benign” are those with 
an estimated > 90% certainty of being benign [34]. Patho -
genic variants are disease-causing mutations [34]. Vari -
ants classified as “likely pathogenic” are those with an 
estimated > 90% certainty of causing disease [34]. If a var -
iant does not fulfill benign or pathogenic criteria, or if the 
evidence for benign and pathogenic are contradictory, 
the variant defaults to being classified as uncertain sig -
nificance [34]. Variants of uncertain significance should 
be reported with caution, and additional testing or itera -
tive clinical investigations may be required to assess the 
effects of these variants [34]. Processing of genetic find -
ings should always be done in the context of the clinical 
phenotype [35].
Case study 1
A 60-year-old healthy male with progressive night visual 
impairment and peripheral visual loss for many years 
and a diagnosis of choroideremia was referred for eval -
uation as a participant for a choroideremia natural his -
tory study. Family history was negative. Best-corrected 
visual acuity was 20/50 in each eye. Funduscopic find -
ings showed areas of well-demarcated chorioretinal atro -
phy, with small islands of retained functional area, in the 
macula of each eye (Fig.  1). The working diagnosis was 
choroideremia; the genetic testing with next-generation 
sequencing panel showed the individual was negative 
for pathogenic mutations of the CHM  gene and posi -
tive for 2 novel heterozygous mutations of the C2orf71 
gene, namely, p.Arg1202Ter (nonsense mutation) and 
p.Ser134ArgfsTer47 (frameshift mutation). Mutations of Table 1 Summary of reported variant classification and

the C2orf71 gene cause autosomal recessive retinitis pig -
mentosa; the 2 novel C2orf71 genetic variants found were 
considered likely positive. The individual was counseled 
regarding the hereditary pattern and the prognosis of his 
C2orf71-associated IRD and will be considered a candi -
date for future C2orf71 clinical trials.
Pedigree analyses are an important complement to 
molecular assessment of IRDs [36, 37]. These analyses 
can support the results of clinical phenotyping, inform 
reproductive risks, and help guide genetic testing [38]. 
However, it is important to consider that some IRDs 
can be difficult to predict on the basis of family history 
alone. For example, approximately 50% of individuals 
with retinitis pigmentosa have no known family history 
of the disease [31, 39], and although most will have auto -
somal recessive inheritance, up to 10% may have X-linked 
inheritance and approximately 24% will have dominant 
inheritance with no known affected family members as 
the result of reduced penetrance or a de novo genetic 
variant [39]. Therefore, different patterns of inheritance 
and associated causative genes should not be ruled out 
without molecular confirmation.
Case study 2
A 7-year-old male suspected of difficulty with night 
vision was found to have 20/20 vision bilaterally with 
normal appearing maculas (Fig.  2). He reported no 
vision problems and has 2 brothers who were asympto -
matic. The individual’s next-generation sequencing panel 
genetic testing showed a hemizygous pathogenic muta -
tion in the ORF15 region of the RPGR gene on the X 
chromosome (c.2270_2271delAG; p.Glu757GlyfsTer12; 
this means a deletion of nucleotides A and G at positions 
2270 and 2271 in the exon leading to a complete change in amino acid sequence starting at the change of position 
757 from glutamic acid to glycine until an early termi -
nation after 12 changed amino acids; see https:// varno 
men. hgvs. org/ recom menda  tions/ prote in/ varia nt/ frame  
shift/ for description of mutation nomenclature). Subse -
quent testing of his siblings showed a similar genotype. 
The genetic testing revealed that all 3 siblings actually 
had X-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to homozygous 
mutations in the RPGR gene. After 16 years, at the age of 
23 years, the individual had a vision of 20/40 bilaterally 
with significant constricted visual fields and was enrolled 
into a clinical trial for RPGR gene therapy.
Genetic counseling
Prior to coordination of genetic testing, a provider famil -
iar with the genetics of retinal diseases (often an IRD spe -
cialist or an ocular genetic counselor) should outline the 
benefits, limitations, and potential implications of genetic 
testing with affected individuals and their caregivers 
[37, 40]. For example, individuals should be made aware 
that targeted genetic testing may miss some differential 
diagnoses because of phenotypic overlap among various 
IRDs [7, 41]. Conversely, it should also be considered that 
broader testing strategies may increase the likelihood of 
unexpected or unclear results and that conditions that 
seem isolated may actually be syndromic [7]. It is impor -
tant for individuals to understand that receiving genetic 
testing does not guarantee that they will receive a molec -
ular diagnosis for their IRD, and a positive genetic test 
result will not necessarily qualify them for a clinical trial 
or therapy [37]. As not all of the genes and variants asso -
ciated with IRDs have been identified, testing may not 
detect the disease-causing variant for all individuals [37]. 
After the pretest consultation with the counselor, indi -
viduals must indicate informed consent to proceed with 
genetic testing [36].
Case study 3
A 59-year-old female was referred for genetic counseling 
of her IRD. She noticed significant night blindness at age 
17 and was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at age 28. 
Further, at the age of 28, she was diagnosed with poly -
cystic kidney disease and underwent a unilateral kidney 
transplant 2  days later. Genetic testing with a limited 
panel of 31 genes implicated in early onset retinal disease 
was ordered before referral for genetic counseling and 
indicated that she was positive for a heterozygous path -
ogenic variant in the RPE65 gene (c.11 + 5G > A). The 
ordering provider incorrectly interpreted the positive test 
result as diagnostic of RPE65-related IRD, changed the 
diagnosis to Leber congenital amaurosis, and advised her 
that she would likely qualify for treatment with Luxturna.

diagnosis of RPGR-mutated X-linked retinitis pigmentosaPage 5 of 9
 Lam et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:514 
 
During the genetic counseling appointment, the indi -
vidual disclosed that she had 2 brothers who died of 
kidney disease in late childhood. Subsequent additional 
genetic testing revealed a complete deletion of the 
NPHP1 gene (interpreted as pathogenic) in the homozy -
gous state. The individual’s retinal disease, kidney dis -
ease, and family history are consistent with a syndromic 
form of retinal dystrophy due to the NPHP1 gene. The 
presence of a pathogenic variant in the RPE65 gene indi -
cates that she is additionally a carrier of recessively inher -
ited RPE65-related retinal dystrophy, a state that does not 
qualify her for Luxturna gene therapy.
Post-test genetic counseling is also important for 
interpreting and discussing genetic test results in light 
of patient history [19, 37]. Accurate interpretation of 
genetic test results is very important and helps health 
care providers advise individuals about their progno -
sis and provide more clarity about how an eye disease 
is inherited [12]. As the number of genes commercially 
available for sequencing increases and the use of genetic 
sequencing processes becomes more widespread, accu -
rate interpretation of the results from these tests is criti -
cal [34]. On the basis of findings from the genetic test, 
counselors will also advise on the implications of results 
for at-risk family members, offer appropriate screening 
or preventative strategies, and educate on other poten -
tial health or lifestyle effects [37, 40]. As previously dis -
cussed, results from genetic testing can help providers 
direct individuals to available targeted therapies and/or 
establish eligibility for participation in applicable ongoing 
clinical studies [19].
Case study 4
A female with progressive impairment of night vision 
from late childhood, legal blindness by age 16, and a diag -
nosis of severe nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa was 
referred for evaluation. Genetic testing showed that she 
was positive for 2 heterozygous mutations of the BBS1 
gene, p.Met390Arg (pathogenic) and p.Glu224Lys (likely 
pathogenic), resulting in a diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syn -
drome. This condition is associated with multiple risks of 
other health conditions, requiring significant medical fol -
low-up. The genetic counselor provided medical manage -
ment guidelines established for Bardet–Biedl syndrome 
to the patient, the referring retina specialist, and the pri -
mary care physician. These include regular ophthalmic 
evaluations, body mass index calculations, diabetes test -
ing, and lipid profiling.
Barriers to genetic testing remain a challenge for 
individuals with IRDs and health care professionals. 
One significant challenge for the widespread imple -
mentation of genetic testing is the varied payment/reimbursement mechanisms across countries [42, 
43]. In some countries, there is limited coverage of 
genetic testing costs [1 , 42]. Insurance companies and 
other funding agencies may be reluctant to pay for 
genetic testing unless there is clear evidence that the 
results will affect medical management [31]. Another 
significant barrier is limited patient access to expert 
providers and genetic testing services, especially in 
underserved and remote areas [44]. Without guidance 
from an IRD or genetics expert, ordering and interpre -
tation of genetic tests can be complex. Because of the 
functional limitations associated with having an IRD, 
affected individuals may need a caregiver to facilitate 
access to genetic testing services and appointments 
with genetic counselors or IRD specialists. This could 
result in loss of workdays or working time for both the 
affected individual and caregiver [45]. Another chal -
lenge is ophthalmologists’ generally limited knowledge 
of genetic services, genetic conditions, and patient risk 
factors [44]. This lack of knowledge can lead to insuf -
ficient referrals from ophthalmologists to IRD experts 
and appropriate genetic services. Inadequate comple -
tion of family history analysis can also impede genetic 
testing efforts [44]. While a thorough family history 
can aid decision-making and inform genetic testing 
approaches, incomplete assessment may delay testing 
or lessen the likelihood of identifying a causative muta -
tion. Finally, difficulties consolidating genetic data into 
public databases can also be a hurdle for genetic testing 
[1, 46, 47]. While large databases are commonly used 
by diagnostic laboratories, entries may not be complete 
or up to date [46, 47]. Variant data may be stored in 
local or specialized databases and not collated in a mul -
ticenter database that can be easily accessed or shared 
[46, 47].
Despite the complexity of genetic tests and their 
practical limitations, it is necessary to overcome these 
barriers to ensure that the best medical care is pro -
vided for individuals affected by IRDs. Some potential 
approaches to overcome these barriers and improve 
the patient’s experience include expanding education 
of health care professionals about IRDs and genetic 
testing options, creating tools to connect affected 
individuals with experts in IRDs [48], and improving 
data sharing via strategies to support streamlined and 
secure distribution of genomic variant data from clini -
cal laboratories [1 ]. A valuable service that has trans -
formed health care in recent years is telemedicine [16]. 
Telemedicine can facilitate medical education, e-health 
patient monitoring, and patient consultation through 
which ocular genetic counselors can provide remote 
counseling to overcome geographical constraints and 
expand access to patient care [16, 49].Page 6 of 9 Lam et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:514 
Genetic testing recommendations for individuals 
with IRDS
To enhance genetic disease management, a decision tree 
algorithm may be useful for easy reference in clinical 
practice to help determine the indications for molecular 
diagnosis in individuals with IRDs (Fig.  3). The Ameri -
can Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations for 
the genetic testing of IRDs state that whenever clinical 
findings suggest the possibility for an IRD for which a 
causative gene or genes have been identified, the treat -
ing ophthalmologist should either discuss the value of 
genetic testing and order an appropriate test (if avail -
able) or refer the individual to an IRD specialist or ocular genetic counselor with expertise in the selection 
and interpretation of molecular tests [12].
Retina specialists or ocular genetic counselors will 
review the individual’s clinical, ocular, and family history 
[37]. In some cases, additional clinical assessments may 
be advised. If evaluation supports the diagnosis of an IRD 
and genetic testing is considered appropriate after pre -
test counseling, a genetic test will be ordered. If a patho -
genic variant is identified, the specialist or counselor will 
assess the result in the context of the individual’s family 
and clinical history to confirm diagnosis and will provide 
actionable recommendations including medical manage -
ment strategies. Ideally, individuals with IRDs should be 
Fig. 3 Decision tree for case scenarios. IRD, inherited retinal diseasePage 7 of 9
 Lam et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2021) 16:514 
 
assessed annually for associated, treatable findings such 
as cataracts and cystoid macular edema. Individuals with 
IRDs are also advised to return for follow-up expedi -
tiously if there is an acute change in vision.
If testing reveals a variant of uncertain significance, 
additional clinical data may be collected or family 
members may be tested; however, this does not always 
help to elucidate the effect of the variant [34]. Vari -
ants of uncertain significance are almost always found 
with next-generation sequencing panel testing or whole 
exome sequencing, with or without applied filters. Family 
member testing can be pursued for parental or segrega -
tion analysis if additional family members are available 
to test. The absence of a genetic variant in both parents 
of a child can prove de novo inheritance, which pro -
vides strong evidence of pathogenicity. In dominant and 
X-linked conditions, if unequivocal co-segregation of a 
clinical phenotype with a variant is established in at least 
3 generations, then a variant of uncertain significance 
is highly likely to be pathogenic and reclassification of a 
Class 3 (variant of uncertain significance) to Class 4 or 
5 (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) is warranted. Fur -
ther, identification of gene-specific phenotype features 
(e.g., flat electro-oculography in a patient with vitelliform 
dystrophy and a BEST1 variant) can also support vari -
ant interpretation. If phenotypic clinical findings suggest 
more than one specific genotype, the variant of unknown 
significance can sometimes be reassessed on the basis of 
the effect on gene and protein structure and function to 
determine potential pathogenicity. Direct assays may be 
useful in cases in which variants are thought to alter RNA 
splicing; however, functional assessments may be time-
consuming and expensive. Structural assessments such as 
in silico analysis may be valuable; however, they should 
generally only be used to support other lines of evidence.
If test results are negative for pathogenic variants, this 
could either indicate that the individual does not have 
a genetic cause of their disease [50] or, more often the 
case, that the molecular cause of the disease has not been 
identified. It is possible that individuals receiving a nega -
tive genetic test result may harbor variants in currently 
unknown IRD genes or in regions of known genes not 
currently identified using current testing methodologies. Genetic reevaluation may be valuable and, because new 
pathogenic genetic variants are continually being identi -
fied, may be considered every 2–5  years. Retesting may 
be dependent on the mode of genetic analysis initially 
utilized. Reanalysis of existing data (e.g., in cases in which 
patients have had whole exome or whole genome analy -
sis) may be simpler and cost less than a complete reevalu -
ation. In cases in which a new genetic test is conducted, it 
is important to assess whether it will be substantially dif -
ferent than previous analyses, as diagnostic tests may not 
be updated regularly. In all cases, coordination between 
the primary provider and retina specialist, and/or genetic 
counselor, is critical to facilitate genetic testing and guide 
appropriate care for individuals with IRDs. Table  2 pro -
vides some useful websites regarding basic management 
of genetic disorders, as well as genetic counseling, genetic 
testing, and available supportive services.
Conclusions
Inherited retinal diseases present challenges in molecu -
lar diagnostics because of their high genetic heterogene -
ity, overlapping clinical presentations, and variability in 
inheritance patterns. Currently, ophthalmologists who 
come across individuals experiencing symptoms con -
sistent with an IRD may benefit from the expertise of an 
ocular genetic counselor or IRD specialist. With the com -
plexity of IRDs, collaboration with specialists may allow 
for improved decision-making regarding the most appro -
priate genetic test panel, pre- and post-test counseling, 
and accurate interpretation of the test findings in the 
context of the clinical diagnosis. While adequate genetic 
testing resources and specialty providers may be unavail -
able in many regions, improved understanding of the 
genetics within ophthalmic subspecialties and increased 
use of telemedicine-based options may help meet the 
needs of individuals to fully understand their diagnosis.
