IntroductIon
Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of rare ocular 
diseases caused by the gradual degeneration of photoreceptors, 
retinal pigment epithelium, and other retinal neurons leading 
to progressive vision loss and eventually blindness. Up to now, 
more than 300 genes have already been identified for inherited 
retinal diseases.1,2The prevalence of IRDs is about 1 in 2000–3000 individuals, 
and it is estimated that over one million people may be 
affected worldwide. Epidemiologic studies show that the 
variation of IRDs diseases’ prevalence directly depends on 
various demographic characteristics, including consanguinity, 
ethnicity, age, and the living area.3,4 In this regard, retinitis 
pigmentosa (RP) and Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) Abstract
Purpose:  To evaluate the effect of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) on vision‑related quality of life (VRQoL) among IRDs’ patients in Iran.
Methods:  This cross‑sectional study was conducted on 192 patients with different types of IRDs who were randomly selected from 
registered patients in the Iranian National Registry for Inherited Retinal Dystrophy (IRDReg®). All ophthalmic findings were collected 
based on the recorded data in IRDReg®. Moreover, the eligible participants were interviewed to fill out the National Eye Institute Visual 
Functioning Questionnaire‑25 (NEI VFQ‑25) to assess their VRQoL. Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the possible 
association of the different clinical and nonclinical factors such as demographic information, socioeconomic status, and visual function 
with VRQoL.
Results:  The overall mean of a composite score of VRQoL was 45. All subscales obtained from the NEI VFQ‑25 questionnaire except general 
health, mental health, and ocular pain had a significant negative correlation with logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCV A) and near visual 
acuity variables. There was a statistically significant relationship between VRQoL and factors like age  (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.87–0.94), employment status (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.05–4.74), logMAR BCV A  (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19–0.49) and normal 
color vision (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.74–5.01).
Conclusion:  The VRQoL of patients with IRDs in this study was low. BCV A could be an indicator to show VRQoL.

in 4000 and 1 in 50,000–100,000 individuals, respectively.5,6
IRDs are reported as one of the leading causes of irreversible 
blindness which RP as the most prevalent type of IRDs is 
the leading cause of hereditary blindness in people younger 
than 60 years old.5,7 IRDs are chronic and incurable, and they 
may affect both quality of life (QoL) and health economics 
by affecting physical well‑being, psychological state, and 
productivity.8,9
In this regard, vision‑related QoL  (VRQoL) is defined as the 
patients’ subjective perception, daily activities related to the 
visual ability, as well as social and emotional aspects of life 
related to the visual status.10 Visual problems due to the IRDs 
resulted in decreased vision and the restriction of the visual 
field (VF), which directly affect the individual daily activities.11
The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire‑25 
(NEI VFQ‑25) was developed recently from the NEI VFQ‑51 
to test the psychometric effects of visual impairment.12 The best 
instrument to assess VRQoL is NEI VFQ‑25. It is even more 
suitable than NEI VFQ‑55 based on the length of the test and 
its feasibility while keeping the same comprehensiveness.13 
This questionnaire with 25 questions was reported to provide 
reliable and valid scores from patients with various eye 
diseases.14‑16
There is no comprehensive information regarding VRQoL 
among Iranian patients who suffer from different types of 
IRDs. Only one study was performed on patients with RP 
that showed that mean NEI VFQ‑25 scores were low in 35 RP 
patients, and decreased visual acuity (V A) has a great impact 
on the QoL.17 However, in other countries, more extensive 
studies were performed on these patients. For instance, a 
qualitative study of IRDs’ patients in the United States, 
Germany, and France showed that night blindness, reduced 
peripheral vision, and problems with color vision were the 
most frequent problems in these patients, and severity of 
limitations vary based on lighting conditions and familiarity 
of environment. These problems affect health‑related QoL.18 
Prokofyeva et al. conducted a study on IRDs patients and 
showed that IRDs affect VRQoL.19 Therefore, we proposed 
to do a national study of the VRQoL among these patients 
who lived in Iran. We also desired to investigate the relation 
of VRQoL in these patients with demographic, socioeconomic 
factors, and visual functions.
Methods
This is a retrospective study. The study population was the 
patients who suffered from different types of IRDs and were 
registered into the Iranian National Registry for Inherited 
Retinal Diseases (IRDReg®)20 from January 2016 to December 
2020. Information about ophthalmic tests, demographics 
variables, age of onset of IRD, and family history were 
extracted from the IRDReg®, and information about the QoL, 
and socioeconomic status (SES) were collected at the time of the study. All patients registered in the IRDReg routinely visit 
clinics for examinations every 6  months, and their information 
about best corrected visual acuity (BCV A), near V A, color 
vision, and ophthalmic examinations are updated.
A sample size of 192 was calculated, but it was planned to 
be increased to 225 individuals with consideration to the 
attrition rate of 15%. These patients were randomly selected 
from IRDReg®.
The ethics committee approved all Shahid Beheshti University 
of Medical Sciences study procedures via the approval number 
of IR.SBMU.PHNS.REC.1399.055. Informed consent was 
obtained from all study participants, and we assured the 
confidentiality of their information.
Only patients with a definite clinical diagnosis of IRDs by 
a retina subspecialist were included. We only interviewed 
patients with IRD aged over 15 years who were able to present 
a valid response. Patients with other ocular pathologies and/or 
systemic disabilities were not investigated in our analysis. In 
the patients with Usher syndrome who had hearing difficulty, 
data collection was conducted with the help of their family 
members or caregivers.
First, a list of all registered patients who were diagnosed 
with IRDs was received from IRDReg®. The list was sorted 
by file number, and patients who were registered more than 
once and individuals under 15 years old were deleted. Then 
using the RND function in Excel software, 225 people were 
selected by simple random sampling until reaching the sample 
size (192 people). Patients were contacted by telephone, 
and NEI VFQ‑25 questionnaire was completed. The data of 
ophthalmic tests, demographics variables, age at symptom 
onset, duration of disease and family history were extracted 
from patients’ documents in the IRDReg®, and information 
about VRQoL and SES were collected at the time of study 
by telephone. Finally, the data were merged and prepared 
for analysis.
Data were collected using a structured questionnaire translated 
into Persian, which consisted of questions for demographic 
factors and SES; VRQoL of participants with IRDs. NEI 
VFQ‑25 including 12 subscales: General health, general 
vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social 
functioning, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, 
driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The values were 
recorded on a 0–100 scale and averaged to generate scores 
for each subscale. The composite score was calculated as the 
average of all questions except general health (2 questions). 
Demographic factors and SES included age, sex, marital 
status, education, occupation, income, residency condition 
(rural or urban), floor area per capita, ethnicity, consanguinity, 
and age of symptom onset. NEI VFQ‑25 questionnaire was 
assessed for reliability and validity by Asgari et al., and it 
was shown to accurately measure VRQoL in Iranian people.21
All IRDs patients underwent a comprehensive clinical 
examination, including assessing the corrected distance Shojaei, et al.: VRQoL in IRDs’ patients82  Journal of Current Ophthalmology | Volume 34 | Issue 1 | January-March 2022visual acuity (CDV A) using Snellen E‑chart. For the 
measurement of V A in this group of patients, we initially 
presented the vision chart to the patient at a distance of 
3 m. Then the chart was moved to the patients upon the 
patient reporting to see the line. Distance reduction was 
carried out for one meter in each step up to the distance 
of 50 cm near the patient, and the V A was recorded based 
on the standard calculation. Afterward, we checked the 
qualitative assessment of counting finger, hand motion, 
and light perception only in cases that were not able to see 
the chart. Furthermore, color vision testing was performed 
using the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic 38‑plates, and 
the evaluation of anterior and posterior segments was 
done by the biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscope, 
respectively. All clinical information was completed based 
on the registered data in the IRDReg® database registry.
The composite score of VRQoL was set at 0–100 points in 
which 0 represented the worst and 100 represented the highest 
QoL. This composite score was converted to an ordinal variable 
(4 levels) based on quartile, which was assigned a score of 
0–24.9, 25–49.9, 50–74.9, and 75–100.
V A classification was considered as presented in the 
International Classification of Diseases 11, so that IRDs 
patients with CDV A worse than 6/12–6/18 were classified 
as mild low vision, and those with CDV A in the range from 
6/18–6/60 and 6/60–3/60 were considered as moderate and 
severe low vision, respectively. Furthermore, patients with 
CDV A worse than 3/60 were defined as blind.22,23 Moreover, 
the color vision status was recorded as normal in patients who 
were able to respond to eight plates correctly. Otherwise, they 
were considered color vision deficient.24 The test results in the 
patients with no perception of demo plate were also recorded 
as not applicable (NA).
Demographic and socioeconomic variables used in this 
study were collected face-to-face or by telephone interview 
along with NEI VFQ‑25 questionnaires. Demographic and 
SES variables, including age, incidence age, duration of 
illness, sex (male, female), marital status (single, married), 
level of education (under diploma, diploma, academic), 
occupation status (unemployed, employed), level of parental 
consanguinity, residency condition  (urban, rural), income 
status (average income per month), and floor area per 
capita (meter) were also recorded.
Statistical analysis
NEI VFQ‑25 subscales, composite score, and continuous 
variables were summarized by the mean and standard 
deviation (SD), and qualitative variables by frequency and 
percentages. To reduce the socioeconomic factors (occupation, 
education, income, residency status, and floor area per capita 
variables) to one composite factor used through Polychoric 
Principal Component Analysis method. Ordinal logistic 
regression was used to examine related factors such as 
demographic, SES, and visual function with VRQoL. All 
variables were evaluated by univariate analysis first, and then variables with  P < 0.25 such as age, disease duration, 
education, occupation, consanguinity, SES, BCV A, color 
vision, and VF were candidates to enter the regression models. 
Pearson correlation was used to evaluate the correlation 
between VRQoL subscales and other variables. All tests 
of association were considered statistically significant at  
P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using the  statistical 
software package STATA Statistical Software version 15.0 
(StataCorp).
results
A total of 225 patients with different types of IRDs were 
randomly selected from 1000 registered patients in the 
IRDReg® database registry. Finally, 192 individuals (response 
rate: 85%) were included. Among study participants, 
86 (44.8%) were males. The mean ± SD of age (year), 
disease duration  (year), and the age at symptom onset (year) 
of the participants were 36.62 ± 13.19, 17.97 ± 12.56, and 
18.50 ± 13.94, respectively. Other demographic characteristics 
are illustrated in Table 1. The frequency distribution of study 
participants was RP in 40.62% (n = 78), cone‑rod dystrophy 
in 14.06% (n = 27), Usher syndrome in 11.46% (n = 22),

cone dystrophy in 5.73% (n = 11) individuals. Furthermore, 
other types of IRDs such as Bestrophinopathy, Choroideremia, 
Gyrate dystrophy, X‑Linked retinoschisis, syndromic RP, 
Goldmann Favre syndrome, fundus flavimaculatus, congenital 
stationary night blindness, central areolar dystrophy, and 
best disease were identified in 13.55% (n = 33) of the study 
participants.
Patients were also evaluated for visual function, and the results 
present that mean ± SD BCV A, present glasses visual acuity, 
and near V A of the participants were 1.28 ± 1.07, 1.29 ± 1.07, 
and 1.15 ± 1.18 logMAR, respectively. Sixty‑six (34.55%) 
patients had color vision deficiency (CVD), 48 (25.13%) had a 
normal color vision, and 77 (40.31%) were not able to respond 
to the Ishihara test due to their severe vision loss (NA).
The mean ± SD of the NEI VFQ‑25 composite score was 
obtained 45.0 ± 23.6. Twelve calculated subscales are 
represented in Table 2 .
All subscales which were obtained from the NEI VFQ‑25 
questionnaire, with the exception of general health, mental 
health, and ocular pain had a significant negative correlation 
with logMAR BCV A and near V A  [Table 3 ]. The highest 
significant negative correlations were between subscales of 
near activities ( r = −0.74), distance activities (r = −0.71), 
social functioning ( r = −0.68), and color vision (r = −0.61) 
with logMar BCV A.
The results of ordinal logistic regression analysis showed 
significant associations between VRQoL and age, occupational 
status, logMAR BCV A, and color vision. The odds of 
increasing the level of VRQoL decreases by 9% with an 
increase in age (per year) with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.91 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–0.94). The odds of employed patients increasing the level of VRQoL was 1.37 (95% CI: 
1.05–4.74) times that of unemployed patients. For each unit 
decrease in score of logMAR BCV A, the odds of increasing 
the level of VRQoL was 69% (OR = 0.31, CI: 0.19–0.49). 
The odds of increasing the level of VRQoL in patients 
with normal color vision increased 92% (OR = 1.92, CI: 
1.74–5.01), and in blind patients (NA to do Ishihara test) 
decreased 64% (OR = 0.64, CI: 0.25–0.87) compare to those 
have CVD [ Table 4 ].
dIscussIon
The finding of this study showed that VRQoL among Iranian 
patients with IRD was low. There was a statistically significant 
relationship between VRQoL with age, employment, logMAR 
BCV A, and color vision.
The overall VRQoL score in the studied patients was 45. This 
score was reported to be 68.4, 52.4, 59.0, 58.1, and 52.7 among 
IRD patients with subtypes of the disease in Japan, Sweden, 
Germany, France, and South Korea, respectively.7,16,19,25,26 The 
VRQoL score obtained in this study was the lowest among 
similar studies, which is consistent with the result of a study 
conducted by Azizi et al. on RP patients in Shiraz (47.6).17 
This difference observed in Iran with developed and European 
countries can be due to the low level of health, treatment, and 
rehabilitation status, lower SES, and diagnosis of the disease at 
the advanced stages in Iran. It means that the different VRQoL 
scores are not necessarily due to ophthalmic disorder and can 
depend on socioeconomic conditions, lifestyle, and other issues 
that are not matched in the present study.
Among VRQoL subscales in the studied patients, the lowest 
score was obtained for the mental health and general vision 
subscales. The highest score was also related to the ocular

the results of other studies.16,19,25‑28 Considering that in all 
similar studies, the lowest score belonged to the mental 
health subscale, it can be concluded that IRDs had the most 
destructive effect on patients’ mental health.The mean logMAR BCV A score is 1.28 in the present 
study, which is higher than the same score obtained in 
other studies in Greece (0.74), France (0.63), Japan (0.66), 
and South Korea (0.63),7,25,28,29 which in turn indicates that 
Iranian patients suffer from more severe visual impairment 
than those in other countries, which are often the developed 
ones. A  previous study on RP patients in Iran reported a mean 
logMAR BCV A score of 1.1,17 which is roughly similar to 
the present study. The lower the V A, the lower QoL will be. 
Moreover, according to studies, V A can somehow be a proxy 
of VRQoL.7,12 Other previous studies that have examined 
visual function with VRQoL indices have also reported a 
significant relationship between VRQoL with improved V A as 
well as VF.16,19,28,30‑32 The present study showed no statistically 
significant relationship between VRQoL and VF, probably 
because this study VF was investigated by asking a question 
from the patient (“Do you have VF disorder or not?”), but 
other studies used the standard test of VF.
The present study showed a significant inverse relationship 
between age and QoL, consistent with other studies.33‑36 
However, in a study, Hahm et al. found no significant 
relationship between VRQoL and age, as well as age with 
the onset of symptoms.16 Considering the chronic and 
progressive nature of this disease and the gradual visual loss, 
V A decreases with increasing age, and such decrease will, 
in turn, affects a person’s performance and daily activities

and write, loss of job, and dependence on others to walk. 
Furthermore, ultimately leading to a decrease in QoL in these 
patients. Moreover, considering the positive and significant 
relationship between the age of onset of symptoms and 
QoL, this relationship can be explained by the fact that the 
higher the age of onset of symptoms, the fewer years lived 
with visual impairment will be; therefore, it will have less 
impact on a person’s QoL.
The results of this study showed that QoL is affected by 
modifiable and nonmodifiable factors such as age, duration 
of disease, and V A. Considering most of the determinants of 
QoL of IRD patients are nonmodifiable, health managers and 
policymakers are advised to enhance the welfare and QoL of 
these patients by considering the modifiable variables such 
as employment, level of education, SES, access to insurance 
services, placing these patients in the classification of special 
patients, providing welfare facilities in urban service centers 
and public environments such as the installation of fluorescence 
on stairs, sidewalks, and special passages (given that most 
patients suffer from night blindness, and commuting from the 
stairs as well as night walking is a problem for most of these 
patients, it is important to create employment opportunities, 
increase the number of associations, and allow patients to 
participate in meetings where other patients with the same 
disease are present to improve their morale, and to allocate 
funds for visual aids, access to services). In addition to the 
aforementioned, age is regarded as an important variable 
in the incidence of disease complications; therefore, the 
codification of rules on genetic counseling for couples, if 
possible, and screening and early detection of disease cases can 
be used as a preventive measure in the primary and secondary 
preventions, respectively. However, considering the current 
situation and absence of an accurate and efficient system for 
timely diagnosis and treatment, using symptomatic therapies 
and rehabilitation services in the form of tertiary prevention 
can also be beneficial.
In conclusion, this study shows an overview of the current 
VRQoL of IRD patients with suggestions to other researchers 
on other types of QoL, especially in the mental dimension. It is 
also recommended to carry out further intervention studies on 
the impact of factors such as counseling, behavioral therapy, 
coping strategies, strategies to improve V A, and the impact 
of exercise on VRQoL of these patients. In addition, these 
patients need psychological counseling to adapt themselves 
to the disease and new skills training to bring them back to 
normal life.
