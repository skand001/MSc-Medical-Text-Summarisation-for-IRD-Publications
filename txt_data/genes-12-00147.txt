Abstract: Inherited optic neuropathies, including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)
and Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA), are monogenetic diseases with a ﬁnal common pathway of
mitochondrial dysfunction leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and ultimately loss of vision.
They are, therefore, excellent models with which to investigate this ubiquitous disease process—
implicated in both common polygenetic ocular diseases (e.g., Glaucoma) and late-onset central
nervous system neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson disease). In recent years, cellular and
animal models of LHON and DOA have matured in parallel with techniques (such as RNA-seq) to
determine and analyze the transcriptomes of affected cells. This conﬂuence leaves us at a particularly
exciting time with the potential for the identiﬁcation of novel pathogenic players and therapeutic
targets. Here, we present a discussion of the importance of inherited optic neuropathies and how
transcriptomic techniques can be exploited in the development of novel mutation-independent,
neuroprotective therapies.

1. Introduction
1.1. Optic Neuropathies
Optic neuropathies are among the most common causes of blindness in the working
age population [ 1], with inherited forms (including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropa-
thy (LHON) [ 2] and Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA)) affecting about 1 in 10,000 of the
population [ 3–5]. In this review, we will present a brief introduction to these conditions
and how the availability of powerful emerging techniques, including transcriptomics, are
quickly revolutionizing both diagnosis and development of novel therapies with potential
applications beyond the eye.
Vision is ultimately lost in both LHON and DOA as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
die secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 6]. This speciﬁc susceptibility of RGCs to
such dysfunction is not completely understood. However, the relatively large metabolic
demand for these specialized cells and their unique anatomy are thought to be important
contributory factors. RGCs have long axonal segments which lack myelin throughout
their intraocular course but gain a myelin sheath on exiting the eye beyond the lamina
cribosa [ 7,8]. As the only nervous tissue visible in vivo and with increasingly sophisticated
cell culture techniques [ 9,10], RGCs present a powerful system in which to interrogate
mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathways that ultimately lead to cell loss and disease

development. Such dysfunction has been implicated in major neurodegenerative diseases,
such as Parkinson’s disease [ 11], Alzheimer’s disease [ 12], and other forms of demen-
tia [13], but the polygenetic inheritance and environmental contribution to these common
conditions are particularly challenging when investigating their pathogenesis.
As monogenetic conditions where mitochondrial function is disturbed, both LHON and
DOA can mitigate some of these challenges and act as useful model diseases of more complex
neurodegenerative disease processes. LHON is a primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
disorder, with the majority of cases caused by one of three point mutations—namely,
m.3460G>A in the MT-ND1 gene, m.11778G>A in the MT-ND4 gene, and m.14484T>C in
theMT-ND6 gene—all of which encode for essential subunits of mitochondrial complex
I [3,7,14–16]. LHON is additionally interesting due to its predilection to manifest in males
and its marked incomplete penetrance—both of which could perhaps have origins in
transcriptomic differences.
In comparison, DOA is nuclear-encoded mitochondrial optic neuropathy caused
by mutations in the OPA1 gene (3q28-q29), which encodes for a multimeric dynamin
GTPase protein located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. OPA1 subserves a
number of functions, including the regulation of mitochondrial fusion, the stability of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial biogenesis, the sequestration
of pro-apoptotic cytochrome cwithin the mitochondrial cristae, and mitochondrial turnover
(mitophagy) [4,17–20].
1.2. “-Omics” Technologies as Applied to Inherited Optic Neuropathies
Our understanding of mitochondrial biology and disease has advanced greatly over
recent years, not least due to the development and maturation of “-omics” technologies.
These can be deﬁned as “high-throughput technologies capable of detecting differences
in a multitude of molecular constituents in organisms [ 21]”, with those that represent the
three strata of central biological dogma (gen omics , transcript omics , and prote omics ) being
prominent. These ﬁelds deal with the detection of differences in DNA sequences, gene tran-
scription, and proteins within tissue. Additionally, particularly relevant to mitochondrial
disease is the developing ﬁeld of metabol omics (centered on the comparison of levels of
products of metabolism) [22,23] and lipid omics [24].
Whilst these disciplines are linked by their comparative nature—experimental plans
often involve the contrast of different conditions (e.g., control and “diseased” states, or be-
tween different cell types)—the emerging ﬁeld of multi-omics (or vertical - omics ) focuses on
complimentary comparisons across domains (Figure 1). For example, highlighting changes
replicated across the transcriptome, the proteome and metabolome will carry particular
signiﬁcance [ 24,25], and this approach is already being used in mitochondrial research [ 26].
As these technologies and their complementary bioinformatic analysis techniques develop,
the power of “- omics ” investigations is likely to increase.
1.3. Transcriptomics
Speciﬁcally, “the transcriptome” refers to the RNA transcribed within a cell, or group
of cells, often with a particular focus on mRNA (both coding and non-coding). Several
methods to quantify mRNA have been developed (see below) and are applied to genetic
eye diseases. For example, assessing transcribed features in a particular sample can be used
to compare changes in gene expression either over time or between control and diseased
states (such as optic neuropathies) [ 27]. Features showing differential expression may be
implicated in the disease process, highlighting areas for further investigation to uncover
aetiologic pathways, novel biomarkers, and therapeutic targets.Genes 2021 ,12, 147 3 of 15
Figure 1. A schematic representing the processes of modeling and investigating inherited optic neuropathies using
“-omics” methods. ( A) Model diseases such as DOA and LHON can be powerful tools in which to investigate the
effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. The study of patients with inherited optic neuropathies is often a two-way process:
in one direction, the characterization of their phenotype and genotype allows the development of useful disease models
(for example, cell -and animal-based). These provide an efﬁcient environment in which to increase our understanding of
underlying disease processes as well as a testing ground for novel therapies before their return in the opposite direction,
back into patients. ( B) Tissues from model systems can be investigated using used in multiple “-omics” techniques—in some
cases, these can be performed simultaneously and analyzed in vertical “multi-omics” experiments (see text). ATACseq—
Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin—a method for assessing which areas of the chromatin superstructure are
open and so likely available for active in transcription, is an example of the rapidly expanding ﬁeld of epigenomics .
(C) Multiple transcriptomic techniques are available and have particular strength in different experimental situations.
“Novel”: Novel techniques are emerging that will further the resolution of these techniquesm including those with
abilities to sequence longer transcripts in one read and those that integrate temporal and spatial information regarding
transcripts (see text). RNA-seq—RNA-sequencing; scRNA-seq—single-cell RNAseq; snRNAseq—single nucleus RNAseq.
(D) Transcriptomic techniques gain power from the large quantity of data that they produce. This necessitates adequately
designed bioinformatic pipelines that are tailored to the exact scientiﬁc question being asked in order to produce a list of
candidate genes for further investigation back in model systems. ( E) Model systems of diseases can include those based on
cultured patient cells or be animals carrying pathogenic variants, leading to phenocopies of human disease. Samples from
these models used in transcriptomic analysis can include tissue (such as retinas) or cell cultures. As many transcriptomic
experiments compare expression between conditions (e.g., disease and control) to produce lists of differentially expressed
genes, the further technical and functional validation of these can be performed back in model systems in preparation for
therapeutic translation in patients (see text).Genes 2021 ,12, 147 4 of 15
2. Transcriptomics in Inherited Optic Neuropathies
2.1. Applications of Transcriptomics in Optic Neuropathies
Several factors make transcriptomics a particularly suitable methodology for the
investigation of optic neuropathies. Whilst the anatomy and physiology of the retina
and optic nerve are relatively well understood compared with other areas of the central
nervous system [ 28], our understanding of pathophysiology in these structures can be less
comprehensive. This is particularly true for inherited optic neuropathies such as LHON
and DOA, where the genomic determinant of the disease in many patients is readily
identiﬁable as a single gene (monogenic disorder) [ 14,18,19]. However, less is known
regarding how this translates into the clinical phenotype of RGC death as well as other as
yet unexplained facets of these model diseases (such as the incomplete penetrance in LHON
when the pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation is present in the homoplastic state
in both affected patients and carriers). Thus, this presents an unmet need to identify the
novel pathways and genes involved to which comparative transcriptomics is particularly
suited. Whilst direct access to RGCs and patient tissues is limited, cellular and mouse
model systems [ 7,29,30] have developed in recent years into powerful platforms with
which to perform transcriptomic studies (and, more importantly, validate and investigate
their ﬁndings). For example, in vivo neuro-retinal tissue can easily be visualized (if not
directly sampled) at the cellular level with techniques such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT), and there are well deﬁned metrics of RGC function at the behavioral (acuity) [ 31],
reﬂex (pupillary) [ 32], and electrophysiological levels [ 33]. To compliment this, induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) RGC models derived from LHON and DOA patient tissues
have proved invaluable for molecular investigations [7]
2.2. Disadvantages of Transcriptomics in Optic Neuropathies
Despite the suitability of inherited optic neuropathy investigations, the limitations of
transcriptomics must be borne in mind when considering data from such studies. In iso-
lation, transcriptomics gives us no direct information on protein dynamics. The mRNA
expression level of a particular gene may correspond to increased protein levels, increased
protein turnover, or indeed changes to post translational protein modiﬁcations. Therefore,
the validation of transcriptomic ﬁndings at the protein or functional level is required if
conclusions are to be drawn regarding the downstream effects of mRNA changes. Planning
this can present further challenges—for example, when comparing transcriptomes in con-
ditions (such as optic neuropathies) with changes dramatic enough to lead to cell death,
large numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are likely. Therefore, methods to
prioritize which DEG to validate while minimizing bias have been developed, and these
are discussed further below and reviewed elsewhere [34].
Whilst preparing tissue for transcriptomic studies, careful tissue handling is equally
important in reducing bias, and indices of extracted RNA quality (such as RNA Integrity
Number “RIN” [ 35]) can be used to assess this. Additionally, and especially in a highly
cellular, complex tissue such as the retina, it is essential to ensure that the identity of
cells undergoing processing is known (for example, photoreceptors and bipolar cells
have an interdigitated synapse that can make them difﬁcult to dissociate and isolate [ 36].
Additionally, the cells isolated must be viable. It is well established that the dissection
of retina from mouse models requires the cutting of the optic nerve (and therefore the
transection of RGC axons), so processing should be as expedient as possible to minimize
the stress response recorded. Indeed, many of these limitations have been addressed as
isolation methods have been developed.Genes 2021 ,12, 147 5 of 15
3. Transcriptomic Methodologies
3.1. Tissue Selection and Sample Preparation
One methodological aspect that has been particularly reﬁned is that of tissue selec-
tion and preparation. Earlier studies made use of tissues dissected by hand from animal
models [ 37] and dissociated into suspension or collected from cultured cells [ 38] in bulk.
This has the advantage of providing a large quantity of RNA for further processing. In ad-
dition, the processing of tissue in this way is relatively easy and expedient, reducing
postmortem alterations in expression—particularly relevant to RGCs following the trun-
cation of their axon during enucleation. Indeed, while improvements have been made
to tissue preparation processes (see below), the basic processes remain constant: RNA is
extracted, isolated, and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) representing
alibrary of the transcripts present [ 27]. Libraries are sequenced after undergoing ampliﬁca-
tion [ 39] or enrichment steps for a particular form of RNA—for example, selecting for the
poly-adenosine tail of transcribed mRNA (of either nuclear or mitochondrial origin) [ 40]
or depleting ribosomal RNA before reverse transcription [ 41] in order to focus on protein
coding mRNA.
3.2. Quantifying Expression
3.2.1. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Once the library has been prepared, it is necessary to quantify the expression of tran-
scripts. In the most basic form, qRT-PCR is an accurate technique to interrogate a small
number of genes [ 42,43]; however, it is limited by its need for oligo-primers requiring the a
priori selection of candidate genes. This technique remains in use as a conﬁrmatory tool
(for example, to conﬁrm sample purity) due to its ease, ubiquity, and economy. However,
the inherent ampliﬁcation of error in the technique [ 44,45] and the concurrent improve-
ment in the technical reliability of microarray and RNA-seq techniques has seen it widely
replaced by other assays in validation experiments.
3.2.2. RNA-Seq
Whilst the development of microarray assays [ 46] represented a paradigm shift and
the beginning of high-throughput transcriptomics, their requirement to deﬁne which genes
to investigate a priori , as well as technical limitations [ 47,48], have led to their replacement
in most applications by RNA-seq techniques. RNA-seq refers to techniques where cDNA is
directly sequenced using high-throughput sequencing techniques [ 27]. The superior ﬂexi-
bility and unbiased nature of this approach (not requiring the a priori deﬁnition of probes)
has seen it supersede microarrays in many areas—particularly comparative transcriptomics.
Indeed, due to these advantages RNAseq has become an integral technique in clinical and
laboratory science and is the the gold standard in multiple disciplines, most notably in
oncology [49] but also more generally (reviewed elegantly here [50]).
Several modiﬁcations of this technique are particularly relevant to the study of RGCs
and optic neuropathies. Given the diversity of RGC cell types [ 51–53] and their differential
response to disease [ 54], techniques that are able to prepare libraries from and sequence
the transcriptomes of individual cells (single cell "scRNA-seq” [ 55,56] or single-nuclei
snRNA-seq [ 57]), are particularly useful. These techniques overcome difﬁculties with “ bulk”
RNAseq techniques in resolving changes in gene expression between subpopulations of
cells. This is achieved by labelling individual transcripts as being from a particularly
labelled cell: this vastly increases resolution by allowing analysis at the level of individual
cells, but concurrently increases the complexity of analysis and the resources required.
In such methods, single cells are isolated (for example, using a microwell plate or
in individual droplets using microﬂuidics) and combined with reaction substrate and a
barcoded bead (see [ 58] for a review of individual methods). This allows library preparation
and sequencing on a cell by cell basis, potentially uncovering changes masked by techniques
dealing with bulk batches of cells [ 59]. Single-cell sequencing has also been useful when
used with clustering techniques to group similar single-cell transcriptomes from individualGenes 2021 ,12, 147 6 of 15
RGCs in the search for novel molecular markers correlating with anatomical and functional
characteristics for subpopulations of RGCs [53].
3.2.3. Future Directions in Quantifying Expression
This characterization of RGC subpopulations and their role in optic neuropathies is
likely to particularly beneﬁt from rapidly developing new technologies within RNA-seq.
Improvements in the resolution of the single-cell “long read” sequencing [ 60] (as opposed to
short reads focusing on the 30end of transcripts) and RNA timestamping [ 61] (which details
temporal changes in mRNA transcripts) have enhanced our ability to understand how
differing transcripts interact and turn over. At the tissue level, the emergence of technology
to allow single-cell multiomics simultaneously on the same cells [ 62] will further increase
the resolution of our understanding of these cells in optic neuropathies.
Perhaps most excitingly, however, is the emerging technique of spatial transcrip-
tomics [ 63], in which the molecular labelling of individually sequenced cells can preserve
information regarding their anatomical location. If this can be developed in conjunction
with multiple electrode array neurophysiology [ 64], which similarly preserves retinal
topology, there is potential for a technique to obtain both single-cell transcriptomic and
single-cell functional data from the same cells, allowing direct validation.
3.3. Analysis of RNA-Seq Data
As RNA-seq techniques have developed over the past few years, so too have the
bioinformatic approaches required to make sense of the often vast quantities of data pro-
duced. Indeed, there is no “gold-standard” pipeline or set of processes for either bulk [ 65]
or scRNA-seq [ 66] analysis, and the approaches have to be tailored to the individual exper-
iment and the scientiﬁc question being addressed by a particular study. However, general
stages of processing do tend to be applied, even if their details vary (Figure 1, and reviewed
here [ 27,55,67–69]). This variability and the great pace of advancement in bioinformatic
methodologies make it essential to precisely document software versions and the settings,
as these can greatly alter results [ 55]. Indeed, replicating notable results using different
software packages may add to the power of conclusions.
4. Clinical and Research Applications of Transcriptomics
4.1. Diagnostic
Mirroring this rapid advancement in data analysis and software techniques in RNA-
seq has been a concurrent improvement in our diagnostic capabilities in genetic disease.
In recent years, approaches to attaining molecular diagnoses in optic neuropathies and in
genetic disease more generally have changed with the continually improving technologies.
The traditional approach of testing for a particular pathogenic variant in a single gene
based on a characteristic clinical presentation has been extended with the testing of “panels”
of genes associated with a particular phenotype (optic atrophy, for example). This has the
advantage of combining clinical prior probability to provide a high diagnostic conﬁdence
when positive, but limits diagnoses to those pre-determined variants tested for on the
panels. While whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have increased
diagnostic yields up to as much as 50% of cases [ 70] by allowing the identiﬁcation of novel
variants, one of their disadvantages is not providing direct information on the pathogenicity
of variants [71].
In this situation, sequencing transcribed RNA (RNA-seq) can be hugely useful in
indicating the downstream effects of variants—for example, by detecting expression levels
outside the normal physiological range (up or down), splicing-related errors, posttranscrip-
tional modiﬁcations, or mono-allelic expression [ 72]. This is especially useful where little
is known regarding a gene, its role in the target tissue, or variants in non-coding regions.
In combination with WGS, RNA-seq has been used to characterize novel disease-causing
genes in mitochondrial disease [73].Genes 2021 ,12, 147 7 of 15
One potential drawback to diagnostic RNA-seq in optic neuropathies lies in its need
to be performed on biopsied disease tissues where the target genes are expressed, which is
not feasible for the optic nerve. A muscle biopsy has proven to be a useful surrogate in
mitochondrial disease, given its high energy demand [ 74]. However, it is emerging that
many genes can be investigated using less invasive techniques, such as blood sampling [ 74].
With the licensing of gene replacement therapies, the need for molecular diagnosis is more
important than ever for individual patients in order to select the most appropriate gene
therapy as these options emerge. To this end, RNA-seq is an important addition to our
armamentarium by expanding our diagnostic ability.
4.2. Disease Mechanisms
4.2.1. Exploring Disease Mechanisms Using Transcriptomics
As discussed above, transcriptomics is invaluable to the identiﬁcation of differentially
expressed genes between samples, in particular the comparison of healthy and diseased
tissues. This has great potential for inherited optic neuropathies (see Table 1) where the
mechanisms connecting pathogenic genomic variants and eventual RGC death are poorly
understood. Genes expressed at signiﬁcantly higher or lower levels in diseased tissues
compared to healthy tissues are obvious candidate players involved in the underlying
disease process [ 37]. However, with the scale of transcriptomic data, this list can extend
to many hundreds of genes, and processes are required to prioritize the most biologically
plausible candidates for further investigation.
A fruitful approach to this has been to interrogate lists of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) for connected sets of genes. With the development of microarray and RNA-seq
technology [ 75], increasingly sophisticated methods, both those relying on the intrinsic
properties of DEG data sets (“unbiased”) and those drawing from databases of gene and
protein function and interactions [ 76–79] (introducing “biological insight”) have been
developed. These include overrepresentation analysis, where lists of DEGs are compared
to annotated databases (such as Gene Ontology [ 80] categories) to highlight ontologies
that are seen particularly often in the list [ 76]. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [ 81]
provides another strategy where lists of DEG are interrogated for the overrepresentation of
groups of genes that are connected to particular biological functions. Ultimately, however,
the decision on which DEGs to further investigate in order to best answer their individual
research question lies with the investigator, armed with the objective prioritization that
these techniques allow (Figure 1).
4.2.2. Technical Validation
Having prioritized candidate DEGs for further investigation, initial investigations
are needed to validate the transcriptomic ﬁndings at the technical level [ 90]. This can
involve techniques to conﬁrm sample purity, such as the qRT-PCR of genes that are known
to be expressed (or not) in the sampled tissue. For example, in a sample of RGCs this
involves checking that known RGC-speciﬁc genes (such as THY1 ) are expressed and those
known to be speciﬁc to other, potentially contaminating, cell types (such as RHO from
rods) are absent [ 36,44,45]. In addition, conﬁrming that proteins relating to candidate genes
are present in target tissues (for example, by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting,
or similar) is a helpful approach to relate ﬁndings at the transcriptomic to the effector
(protein) level if the appropriate a priori knowledge is available.Genes 2021 ,12, 147 8 of 15

4.2.3. Functional Validation
When investigating potential disease mechanisms in optic neuropathies, the validation
of the functional role of DEGs is paramount. Do changes identiﬁed at the transcriptomic
level result in an alteration in cellular function relative to disease progression which could
represent a therapeutic target? As direct access to retinal and optic nerve tissues fromGenes 2021 ,12, 147 9 of 15
patients with inherited optic neuropathies is not practical, such work has relied heavily
on preclinical models. These have been established from patient-derived cells (blood cells,
ﬁbroblasts, lymphoblasts, and cybrid cell lines) which allow the faithful replication of
some cellular disease processes found in mutation-carrying cells, but outside of the RGCs
themselves (extensively reviewed elsewhere [ 10]). Over the last decade, technological ad-
vances have allowed the generation of RGC cell lines [ 9] engineered from patient ﬁbroblasts
(via induced pluripotent stem cell technology) and animal disease models [ 7] that faithfully
replicate the environment of the RGC in the diseased human retina (reviewed in [7]).
Within model systems, the overexpression or inhibition of candidate genes can be
fruitful approaches to validation. In the context of a promising therapeutic target, the ma-
nipulation of levels of gene expression in the model should lead to in changes in the metrics
of the disease process (as in [ 59]). For an inherited optic neuropathy, the parameters can
be anatomical, such as the rate of RGC survival, or relate to a known pathological process
contributing to disease (e.g., mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or reactive oxygen
species turnover [91]).
The increasing variety and sophistication of in vitro and in vivo disease models for
inherited optic neuropathies offer differing advantages that could be effectively harnessed
in future transcriptomic studies to form a hierarchical validation pathway. For example,
a large number of prioritized DEGs could be screened in relatively inexpensive and efﬁcient
traditional cell lines. Promising candidates from this work could then be investigated in
more complex iPSC-RGC models to identify a small number of candidates for valida-
tion in animal models with a view towards translation. Furthermore, by using clinically
demonstrated vectors (such as the adeno-associated virus [ 92]) candidate genes could be
manipulated in vivo , with the advantage of being able to investigate meaningful effects at
an organism level—for example, by quantifying visual acuity [ 93] or electrophysiological
measures [33].
4.3. Therapeutic Development
4.3.1. Personalized Medicine
The clinical application of transcriptomic techniques has increased our ability to pro-
vide a conﬁrmed molecular diagnosis to patients with a suspected inherited optic neuropa-
thy. In recent years, this has become particularly important as gene replacement therapies
have advanced to human clinical trials, as in LHON [ 94,95]. Clinical transcriptomics are
already in use to personalize therapy regimes in areas such as oncology [ 96], and its future
application to inherited optic neuropathies represents an exciting development in the ﬁeld.
4.3.2. Transferable Neuroprotective Strategies
Transcriptomics has the great potential to identify targets for generalizable , mutation-
independent neuroprotective strategies for inherited optic neuropathies. These paradigms
of mitochondrial disease can provide a platform from which to identify and develop novel
therapeutics for other ocular and neurodegenerative diseases in which mitochondrial
dysfunction has been implicated. This is particularly timely, given not only the ongoing
maturation of models with which to functionally validate transcriptomic ﬁndings in optic
neuropathy, but also the concurrent explosion in innovative ocular gene therapy approaches
and viral vector delivery [ 97–99]. Such techniques which are already licensed for clinical
use in other conditions could be used to quickly develop therapies based on in vitro work to
directly manipulate the intended therapeutic targets [ 92]. For example, “gene replacement”
therapy has been successfully used to express wild-type copies of genes with homozygous
null or haploinsufﬁcient heterozygous pathogenic variants in vivo [92,100,101], with similar
techniques also used to express neuroprotective genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) in animal models [ 98]. Additionally, techniques to downregulate genes with
a dominant negative effect have also been developed and successfully applied to various
inherited retinal disorders [102–105].Genes 2021 ,12, 147 10 of 15
One of the reasons that in vivo ocular gene therapy has been so successful is the acces-
sibility of the target cells, with RGCs being the ﬁrst cell type encountered by therapeutic
agents injected intravitreally (be it a viral vector, small molecule compound [ 106], or other
biologic therapy [ 97,107,108]). Clearly, the extrapolation of potential neuroprotective strate-
gies from an ocular model to more generalized central nervous system disorders will pose
additional challenges. Here, direct access to tissue will not be as straightforward and
much larger vector doses may be required, with an increased risk of adverse off-target
effects [109], which will require close monitoring.
5. Conclusions
In this review, we have critically appraised how powerful transcriptomic techniques
have the potential to facilitate the diagnosis of patients with inherited optic neuropathies
and, crucially, achieve a better understanding of the pathological processes that contribute
to RGC loss. The insight gained can then be exploited to develop targeted therapies to
enhance RGC survival, which could have much broader relevance for other neurode-
generative diseases characterized by disturbed mitochondrial function. Presently, an un-
precedented conﬂuent maturation of complementary techniques is occurring in single-cell
transcriptomics, bioinformatics, relevant disease models, and clinically translatable effector
techniques. The potential for therapeutic advances in the eye, and beyond, is an exciting
proposition for the coming decade.
