•P U R P O S E :  To examine  the genetic  and clinical  features  
and the natural  history  of RBP3  -associated  retinopathy.  
•D E S I G N :  Multi-center  international,  retrospective,  case 
series of adults and children,  with moleculraly  confirmed  
RBP3  -asociated  retinopathy.  
• METHODS:  The genetic,  clinical,  and retinal  imaging  
findings,  including  optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT)  
and fundus  autofluorescence  (FAF),  were investigated  
both cross-sectionally  and longitudinally.  The results  
of international  standard  full-field  electroretinography  
(ERG)  and pattern  electroretinography  (PERG)  were re- 
viewed.  
• RESULTS:  We ascertained  12 patients  (5 female  and 7 
male) from 10 families  (4 patients  previously  reported).  
Ten novel disease-causing  RBP3  variants  were identified.  
Ten patients  were homozygous.  The mean age ( ±SD, 
range)  of the group was 21.4 years ( ±19.1, 2.9-60.5  
years)  at baseline  evaluation.  All 12 patients  were highly  
myopic,  with a mean spherical  equivalent  of –16.0D  
(range,  –7.0D  to –33.0D).  Visual  acuity  was not sig- 
nificantly  different  between  eyes, and no significant  ani- 
sometropia  was observed.  Mean best-corrected  visual acu- 
ity (BCVA)  was 0.48 logMAR  (SD, ±0.29; range,  0.2- 
1.35 logMAR);  at baseline.  Eleven  patients  had longi- 
tudinal  BCVA  assessment,  with a mean BCVA  of 0.46 
logMAR  after a mean follow-up  of 12.6 years. All pa-

by the age of 7 years old. All patients  had myopic  fundi 
and features  in keeping  with high myopia  on OCT, in- 
cluding  choroidal  thinning.  The 4 youngest  patients  had 
no fundus  pigmentary  changes,  with the rest of the pa- 
tients presenting  with a variable  degree  of mid-peripheral  
pigmentation  and macular  changes.  FAF showed  variable  
phenotypes,  ranging  from areas of increased  signal to ad- 
vanced  atrophy  in older patients.  OCT showed  cystoid  
macular  edema  at presentation  in 3 patients,  which  per- 
sisted during  follow-up  in 2 patients  and resolved  to atro- 
phy in the third patient.  The ERGs were abnormal  in 9 
of 9 cases, revealing  variable  relative  involvement  of rod 
and cone photoreceptors  with additional  milder  dysfunc-  
tion post-phototransduction  in some. All but 1 patient  
had PERG  evidence  of macular  dysfunction,  which  was 
severe  in most cases. 
• CONCLUSIONS:  This study details  the clinical  and 
functional  phenotype  of RBP3  -retinopathy  in the largest  
cohort  reported  to date. RBP3  -retinopathy  is a dis- 
ease characterized  by early onset, slow progression  over 
decades,  and high myopia.  The phenotypic  spectrum  
and natural  history  as described  herein  has prognostic  
and counseling  implications.  RBP3  -related  disease  should  
be considered  in children  with high myopia  and reti- 
nal dystrophy.  (Am J Ophthalmol  2024;258:  119–

large, 135-kDa  secreted  protein  that binds and trans- 
ports cis / trans retinols  between  photoreceptors  and RPE. 4 
The irbp–/–knock-out  (KO) mouse  shows abnormalities  
of photoreceptor  morphology  and significantly  reduced  
photoreceptor  survival  and electroretinogram  (ERG)  re- 
sponses,  with slow progression  over time. 5 Exaggerated  eye 
growth  has been reported  in IRBP-deficient  mice in early 
development.  6 
RBP3 -retinopathy  has been reported  in only 3 families,  
with a total of 8 affected  members.  den Hollander  et al re- 
ported  4 adult siblings  from a consanguineous  Italian  family 
with autosomal  recessive  retinitis  pigmentosa  (arRP)  and 
RBP3 -variants.  7 In the second  report of RBP3 variants  caus- 
ing human  disease,  Arno et al reported  the clinical  pheno-  
types in 4 children  from 2 families,  with homozygous  non- 
sense variants,  with generalized  rod and cone dysfunction  
and unremarkable  fundus  appearance.  8 All 8 children  had 
high myopia,  highlighting  RBP3 -variants  as a rare cause of 
retinal  dystrophy  and high myopia.  7 , 8 
The natural  history  and visual prognosis  of RBP3 - 
retinopathy  is poorly  understood,  and informed  patient  
management  is limited  by the rarity of the disease  and re- 
lated literature.  Herein  we examine  the clinical  character-  
istics along with the structural  and functional  outcomes  
in the largest  RBP3 cohort  reported  to date, consisting  of 
12 molecularly  confirmed  children  and adults.  We describe  
their genetic,  clinical,  and electrophysiologic  features;  in- 
vestigate  genotype–phenotype  correlations;  and establish  
longitudinal  clinical  correlations  among  best-corrected  vi- 
sual acuity (BCVA)  and age, optical  coherence  tomography  
(OCT)  characteristics,  and fundus  autofluorescence  (FAF)  
features.  
METHODS  
This retrospective  case series study adhered  to the tenets of 
the Declaration  of Helsinki.  Each subject  (and a parent  for 
subjects  < 18 years of age) gave written  informed  consent  
before genetic  testing.  The study is in agreement  with local 
institutional  ethics committees.  
• SUBJECTS:  Adults  and children  with RBP3 -retinopathy  
who were examined  in the retinal  genetics  service  in 3 ter- 
tiary centers  (Moorfields  Eye Hospital,  London,  UK; Ed- 
ward S. Harkness  Eye Institute,  New York–Presbyterian  
Hospital,  New York, NY, USA; and National  Hospital  Or- 
ganization  Tokyo Medical  Center,  Tokyo,  Japan),  were re- 
cruited.  RBP3 -retinopathy  diagnosis  was based on clinical  
findings  and family history,  and was confirmed  by genetic  
testing  in all patients.  
•RBP3 GENETIC  ANALYSIS:  A combination  of direct 
Sanger  sequencing  and next generation  sequencing,  in- cluding  panels  of retinal  dystrophy  genes, whole exome  se- 
quencing  (WES),  and whole genome  sequencing  (WGS),  
was used to identify  variants  in RBP3 . All recruited  pa- 
tients were reassessed  for their detected  RBP3 variants,  as 
described  in the Supplemental  Material  (Methods).  
•O C U L A R  EXAMINATION  AND BCVA:  Review  of clinical  
records,  including  medical  and ocular histories,  slitlamp  
biomicroscopy,  and dilated  funduscopic  examination  was 
performed.  Age of onset was defined  as the age at the first re- 
ported  symptoms.  BCVA  was measured  using Snellen  charts 
and converted  into logarithm  of the minimum  angle of res- 
olution  (logMAR)  units for statistical  analysis.  BCVA  of 
the best-seeing  eye was used to categorize  patients  into 1 of 
4 groups  based on the World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  
visual impairment  criteria,  which defines  a person  with no 
or mild visual impairment  when presenting  VA is ≤0.48 
logMAR,  moderate  impairment  when VA is 0.48 to 1 log- 
MAR,  severe if it is 1 to 1.3 logMAR,  and blindness  if it 
is > 1.3 logMAR.  Low vision corresponds  to patients  with 
moderate  and severe impairment.  
•R E T I N A L  IMAGING:  Fundus  photography  (Optos  ultra 
widefield  camera;  Optos or Topcon),  infrared  reflectance  
(IR), spectral  domain  (SD)–OCT  and short-wavelength  
(488-nm)  FAF were performed  longitudinally  for most of 
the patients.  Analysis  was performed  using all available  
data. Not all modalities  or tests were available  at all vis- 
its, and different  baseline  and last follow-up  were used to 
maximize  follow-up  time for all the studied  parameters.  The 
mean age and follow-up  time are reported  individually  for 
each parameter.  The presence  of complications  due to high 
myopia  were also reviewed.  Qualitative  and quantitative  
imaging  analysis  were attempted  for FAF and OCT scans. 
• ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL  TESTING:  Full-field  elec- 
troretinograpy  (ERG)  and pattern  electroretinograpy  
(PERG)  testing  were performed,  incorporating  the stan- 
dards of the International  Society  for Clinical  Electro-  
physiology  of Vision  (ISCEV).  9 , 10 PERG  P50 was used as 
an objective  measure  of macular  function  and the dark- 
adapted  (DA) and light-adapted  (LA) full-field  ERGs used 
to assess generalized  rod and cone system  function.  The 
ERG data were compared  with a reference  range from a 
group of healthy  subjects  (age range, 10-79 years).  11 , 12 The 
amplitudes  of the main full-field  ERG components  were 
plotted  as a percentage  of the age-matched  lower limit of 
normal  (defined  as the 5th percentile),  whilst peak times 
were plotted  as the difference  from the age-matched  upper 
peak time limit (95th percentile),  including  the DA 10 
ERG a-wave,  and the LA 3 single flash ERG b-wave  and 
the LA 30-Hz ERG. 
• STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS:  Statistical  analysis  was carried  
out using SPSS Statistics  for Windows  (version  22.0; IBM 
Corp.).  Significance  for all statistical  tests was set at P <

RESULTS  
• DEMOGRAPHIC  DATA:  We ascertained  12 patients  (5 fe- 
male and 7 male),  from 10 families.  Four patients  (P1-P4)  
were previously  reported.  8 Clinical  data and BCVA  were 
available  at 1 or more visits for all patients.  The mean age 
( ±SD, range)  of the group was 21.4 years ( ±19.1, 2.9-60.5  
years) at first evaluation.  The baseline  age and the follow-  
up time is indicated  below for each individual  assessment.  
Table 1 summarizes  the demographics,  age at first examina-  
tion, follow-up  time, and BCVA  for each patient.  
• GENETIC  ANALYSIS:  All recruited  patients  had likely 
pathogenic  variants  or variants  of uncertain  significance  in 
the RBP3 gene. A total of 12 variants  were identified,  with 
only 2 of them previously  reported.  8 Ten patients  were ho- 
mozygous  for the identified  variants.  Table 2 summarizes  the 
genetics  of all patients,  and Figure 1 presents  the localiza-  
tion of the identified  variants  in the gene domains.  Eight 
patients  were not previously  reported  ( Table 2 ). The Sup- 
plemental  Table presents  all sequence  variants,  based on 
their HGVS  nomenclature  (ID: NM_002900.3)  and their 
predicted  effect, pathogenicity  assessment  based on the 
American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  
(ACMG)  guidelines,  allele frequency,  coverage,  general  
and functional  prediction  scores,  and conservation  scores.  
•D I S E A S E  ONSET,  SIGNS,  AND SYMPTOMS:  All patients  
were symptomatic  with reduced  VA and myopia  by the age 
of 7 years. Four patients  were symptomatic  at birth, with 
1 patient  having  congenital  nystagmus  (P08),  and 4 pa- 
tients (33%)  lifelong  nyctalopia  (age range, 16-56 years).  All 12 patients  were highly  myopic,  with a mean spherical  
equivalent  of right and left eye at last refraction  of –16.0D  
(range,  –7.0 diopters  [D] to –33.0 D). No significant  ani- 
sometropia  was observed.  Strabismus  was documented  in 6 
patients  (50%),  with 2 patients  undergoing  surgery.  One pa- 
tient had clear lens exchange  in both eyes before the age of 
30 years, and 2 patients  had early cataract  extraction  and 
intraocular  lens implants  before the age of 60 years. Other-  
wise, the visual axis was clear in all patients.  
All patients  had myopic  fundi and features  in keeping  
with high myopia,  including  retinal  and choroidal  thin- 
ning, and prominent  choroidal  vessels.  The fundus  find- 
ings were symmetric  between  the left and right eyes in 
all cases, and at all visits ( Figure 2 ). The four youngest  
patients  had no fundus  pigmentary  changes  ( Figure 2 , A- 
C), with the rest presenting  with a variable  degree  of mid- 
peripheral  intraretinal  pigmentation  ( Figure 2 , D-F) and/or  
macular  atrophic  changes  ( Figure 2 , F-H). All 4 patients  
with nyctalopia  had pigmentary  fundi changes.  No patient  
had documented  choroidal  neovascularization  or retinal  de- 
tachment  due to high myopia.  One patient  had periph-  
eral punched-out  chorioretinal  atrophy  (P5) arranged  in 
multiple  curvilinear  streaks  (Schlaegel-like  lines) bilater-  
ally ( Figure 2 , F), which was observed  over 6 years, with 
increasing  pigmentation  over time. 
• NON-OCULAR  MANIFESTATIONS:  No non-ocular  man- 
ifestations  were identified.  However,  ascertainment  bias 
cannot  be excluded,  as the vast majority  of patients  were 
recruited  from a stand-alone  eye hospital  (Moorfields  Eye 
Hospital).  
•V I S U A L  ACUITY:  BCVA  was assessed  cross-sectionally  
and longitudinally.  Baseline  BCVA  was highly  variable  
among  patients,  but there was no significant  interocular  dif- 
ference  (W = 10, Wilcoxon  signed  rank test). Mean BCVA  
of the right and left eyes was 0.48 logMAR  (SD, ±0.29;

no patient  was blind. In total, 4 patients  (33%)  had low vi- 
sion. Figure 3 B, depicts  the age distribution  for each class 
of visual impairment  at the initial and latest visit. 
• FUNDUS  AUTOFLUORESCENCE:  FAF was available  for 
all 12 patients  for cross-sectional  assessment  (mean  age 
±SD, 27.0 ±18.6 years; range, 4.7-61.3  years).  FAF showed  
variable  phenotypes,  ranging  from areas of increased  sig- 
nal to advanced  atrophy  in older patients  ( Figure 4 ). The 
younger  patients  with relatively  normal  fundus  appearance  
showed  areas of increased  signal on FAF ( Figure 4 , A-B). 
All patients  after the third decade  of life showed  areas of atrophy  within  the temporal  vascular  arcades  ( Figure 4 , E- 
I). Patients  after the fourth decade  developed  extensive  pe- 
ripheral  atrophic  changes  ( Figure 4 , G-I). FAF findings  were 
symmetric  between  eyes. Eleven  patients  had longitudinal  
FAF assessment,  with a mean follow-up  of 6.4 years (range,  
0.4-11.9  years).  Three patients  (age range, 21-38 years) had 
progressive  FAF abnormalities  over a mean follow-up  of 8.2 
years. 
•O P T I C A L  COHERENCE  TOMOGRAPHY:  OCT was avail- 
able for all patients  at a mean age of 27 years (range,  4.7-

over follow-up.  Patient  7 (G) had CME at baseline,  which resolved  during follow-up  with worsening  atrophic  changes  and retinal 
thinning.  Patients  8 and 9 (H and I) had EZ disruption,  which worsened  during follow-up  centrally  and peripherally,  respectively.

mean follow-up  of 6.8 years (range,  0.5-11.9  years).  All pa- 
tients had increased  reflectivity  of the RPE and choroidal  
thinning.  OCT showed  cystoid  macular  edema  (CME)  at 
presentation  in 5 eyes of 3 patients  ( Figure 5 , F-G), which 
persisted  during  follow-up  in 3 eyes ( Figure 5 , F) and re- 
solved  in 2 eyes ( Figure 5 , G). Five patients  (mean  age, 10.2 years; range, 4.7-14.04  years) showed  a continuous  ellipsoid  
zone (EZ) that remained  stable over a mean follow-up  pe- 
riod of 9.2 years. The length  of the preserved  EZ was not 
quantified  because  of the variable  imaging  systems  and the 
lack of correction  for axial length,  given also the high my- 
opia of the cohort.  Four patients  with a mean age of 40.3

DA10 ERG a-wave  amplitude,  with exception  of baseline  data in P4 (included  to compare  with follow-up  data in the same subject).  
Note that ERGs were undetectable  in P8. Patients  are identified  along the abscissa  (age at time of testing in parentheses).  
years (range,  21.1-60.6  years) had atrophic  changes,  with 
2 worsening  over a follow-up  of 10.3 years. Three patients  
(mean  age, 37.9 years; range, 17-57 years) had EZ disrup-  
tion, either centrally  or peripherally,  that worsened  over 
time. A variable  degree  and extent  of epiretinal  membrane  
(ERM)  was observed  in 9 patients  (75%).  Examples  of lon- 
gitudinal  OCT assessment  are presented  in Figure 5 . 
• ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  Nine patients  (age range 5-37 
years; median  17 years) underwent  ERG and PERG  test- 
ing incorporating  the ISCEV  standard  protocols  and were 
recorded  with gold foil corneal  electrodes.  There was a high 
degree  of interocular  ERG symmetry  based on amplitudes  
of the DA 0.01, DA 10 a- and b-waves,  the LA3 a- and 
b-waves,  and LA 30 Hz ERGs (slope = 0.99, r2 = 0.97). 
The full-field  ERG findings  in right eyes are summarized  in 
Figure 6 , including  baseline  and follow up data from P4. 
The DA and LA ERGs were undetectable  in 1 case (P8; 
17 years of age), consistent  with a severe photoreceptor  
dystrophy.  In others,  baseline  recordings  revealed  either a 
similar  degree  of generalized  rod and cone system  dysfunc-  
tion (n = 4) or evidence  of a rod–cone  pattern  of dysfunc-  
tion (n = 3; P2, P4, and P6). In addition  to DA10 ERG 
a-wave  reduction  in all cases, indicating  rod photoreceptor  
dysfunction,  the DA ERG b:a ratio was subnormal  in 3 cases 
(P3, P5, and P7) and in 7 of 8 the LA3 ERG b:a ratio was 
subnormal  (n = 3; P3, P5, and P6) or borderline  (n = 4; 
equal to or minimally  lower than the 5th percentile;  P1, P2, 
P4, and P9). In case P5, with markedly  subnormal  DA10 ERG a-wave  and additional  b:a ratio reduction,  the b-wave  
was additionally  of short peak time, and the waveform  was 
likely mediated  by dark adapted  cones (see Discussion).  
There was no significant  correlation  or consistent  trend be- 
tween decreasing  refractive  error and DA10 ERG b:a ra- 
tios (RE: y = –0.011x,  r2 = 0.14; LE y = 0.026, r2 = 0.22) 
or LA3 ERG b:a ratios (RE; y = –0.0054,  r2 = 0.026; LE 
y = 0.011, r2 = 0.035).  
The LA30 Hz ERGs were delayed  in 8 of 8 cases (by 3 to 
12 milliseconds),  with a strong positive  association  between  
age and LA 30Hz peak time delay ( r2 = 0.85). PERG  P50 
was undetectable  in most (n = 5), showed  significant  reduc-  
tion (n = 2; P1 and P6, 10 and 18 years of age, respectively)  
and was normal  in 2 cases (P3 and P4; 7 and 5 years of age, 
respectively),  consistent  with sparing  of macular  function.  
Subject  P4 was initially  tested at the age of 5 years and un- 
derwent  follow-up  recordings  at the age of 12 years (ERG 
amplitudes  are quantified  and compared  in Figure 6 ). There 
was initial evidence  of a rod–cone  dystrophy  with normal  
PERG  in keeping  with preserved  macular  function,  but 7 
years later the ERGs showed  more marked  worsening  of 
LA than DA ERGs (including  an increase  in LA30Hz  peak 
times from 31 to 35 milliseconds)  and a transition  from a 
rod–cone  to similar  severity  of rod and cone dysfunction,  
with PERG  P50 abolition  indicating  severe worsening  of 
macular  function.  
• GENOTYPE–PHENOTYPE  CORRELATIONS:  Genotype–
phenotype  assessment  was limited  by the relatively  small 
126 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY FEBRUARY 2024number  of cases. Half of the patients  with milder  fundus  
changes,  better BCVA,  and best preserved  rod function  
(P1-P4;  5-10 years of age at the time of ERG) were homozy-  
gous for null variants  (P03-P04),  and half were homozygous  
for non-null  variants  (P01-P02).  These included  3 of the 4 
patients  with a normal  (P3, P4) or detectable  (P1) PERG  
consistent  with normal  or relatively  spared  macular  func- 
tion ( Figure 6 ). Three patients  with 2 non-null  variants  
(P07, P08, and P11) had more severe disease,  including  the 
only patient  with undetectable  ERGs (P8; tested at the age 
of 17 years) and another  case with a severe ERG phenotype  
(P7; age 34 years).  P11 with non-null  variants  was the 
oldest in the cohort,  with the most advanced  atrophic  
changes  and the worst vision (ERG not performed).  The 
data, based on few cases, suggest  that there is a lack of 
genotype–phenotype  correlation  and that age may be a 
more important  determinant  of disease  severity.  
DISCUSSION  
The current  study describes  the genetic,  clinical,  and 
imaging  characteristics  of 12 patients  with molecularly  
confirmed  RBP3 -retinopathy,  including  cross-sectional  and 
longitudinal  analysis.  It represents  the largest  cohort  to 
date to undergo  detailed  investigation,  including  multi- 
modal imaging,  international  standard  electrophysiology,  
and genotype–phenotype  assessment.  Our results  provide  
insights  into the retinal  phenotype  and natural  history,  over 
a wide range of ages. Eight novel sequence  variants  are re- 
ported.  
The natural  history  of the disease  is characterized  by 
slowly progressive  retinal  degeneration  affecting  both the 
periphery  and the fovea in older individuals.  The disor- 
der is characterized  by variable  relative  dysfunction  of rod 
and cone photoreceptors,  with a high incidence  of milder  
dysfunction  that might be post-phototransduction  or inner 
retinal.  The 4 young patients  previously  reported  by our 
group and included  in the current  study (P1-P4)  had rel- 
atively  mild disease  compared  with older individuals,  sug- 
gesting  a strong association  between  age and disease  sever- 
ity. However,  despite  1 case (P4) showing  worsening  cone 
function  over 7 years, these individuals  showed  no imag- 
ing evidence  of progressive  retinal  degeneration  , despite  
nullizygous  variants,  suggesting  wide phenotypic  variability  
and the possibility  of less progressive  disease.  In the current  
study, 3 patients  had progressive  FAF changes  with macular  
involvement  during  their follow-up  period.  Patients  with 
nyctalopia  had mid-peripheral  pigmentary  changes.  Less 
pigment  migration  is consistent  with RBP3 preferential  role 
in RPE. 13 Older patients  had advanced  atrophic  changes  
and vision loss. The lack of genotype–phenotype  correla-  
tion and disease  variability  highlights  the need for com- 
prehensive  phenotyping.  Longitudinal  studies  over longer  follow-up  will be required  to establish  the variability  in later 
life. 
Full-field  ERGs revealed  similar  severity  of rod and cone 
system  dysfunction  in most cases, with marked  macular  dys- 
function  similar  to that seen in forms of cone–rod  dys- 
trophy,  although  there were exceptions  including  1 case 
with a normal  PERG.  Three patients  had greater  rod than 
cone involvement,  including  2 patients  with relatively  pre- 
served  macular  function,  in keeping  with common  forms of 
rod–cone  dystrophy.  It is highlighted,  however,  that base- 
line ERGs in one of these cases (P4) at the age of 5 years 
progressed  over 7 years, revealing  a transition  to more of 
a cone–rod  functional  phenotype  ( Figure 6 ). Other RBP3 
cases that present  with a rod–cone  pattern  of dysfunction  
may evolve  similarly.  One case with a rod–cone  dystrophy  
showed  DA10 ERG a-wave  reduction  and a low b:a ra- 
tio but with shortening  of b-wave  peak time and with the 
waveform  likely representing  a dark-adapted  cone system  
contribution  exposed  in the absence  of rod function,  as in 
some other predominant  rod photoreceptor  disorders.  14-17 
In addition  to primary  photoreceptor  dysfunction,  most 
cases showed  a low or reduced  ERG b:a ratio consistent  
with additional  but milder  inner retinal  dysfunction.  The 
cause is uncertain,  but similar  findings  have been reported  
in other photoreceptor  and cone–rod  dystrophies,  18-22 in- 
cluding  those related  to CRX variants.  23-25 RBP3 is transac-  
tivated  by CRX; however,  unlike  CRX cases, RBP3 -related  
retinal  disease  is associated  with high myopia.  Axial lengths  
were not available  for the current  RBP3 cohort,  but there 
was no evidence  that refractive  index influenced  the ERG 
b:a ratios, broadly  in keeping  with previous  ERG studies  
showing  a preserved  b:a ratio across a wide range of myopic  
patients.  26-30 
Twelve  RBP3 variants  were identified  in the current  
study, including  4 missense  (non-null),  4 nonsense  (null),  
2 truncating  variants  that may escape  nonsense-mediated  
mRNA  decay (NMD;  non-null),  1 frameshift  (null),  and 1 
in-frame  deletion  (non-null).  Presumably,  loss of function  
is the genetic  mechanism  of RBP3 -retinopathy,  given the 
confirmed  autosomal  recessive  inheritance  and the pheno-  
typic features  of irbp−/−KO mouse  (photoreceptor  abnor-  
mality)  and irbp−/ + heterozygote  mouse  (no changes).  5 The 
presence  of non-null  variants  may suggest  hypomorphic  or 
milder  clinical  effects;  however,  the genotype–phenotype  
correlation  based on the presence  of null variants  was not 
revealed  in the current  study. In a previous  experimen-  
tal report,  D1080N  stopped  the secretion  of IRBP, creat- 
ing large insoluble  complexes  through  disulfide  bonds,  then 
caused  stress within  the endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER) and 
protein  misfolding.  31 These suggest  both loss of function  
and gain of a harmful  function,  which may occur in RBP3 - 
retinopathy.  Although  this hypothesis  cannot  fully support  
the pathogenicity  of the detected  missense  variants  in the 
current  study, further  knowledge  of clinical  and experimen-  
tal studies  could clarify the exact clinical  effect of each 
detected  variant.  Seven of 12 variants  were classified  into 
VOL. 258 N ATURAL HISTORY OF RBP3-R ETINOPATHY 127variants  of uncertain  significance  according  to the ACMG  
guideline.  The assessment  results  are inconclusive,  as ad- 
ditional  factors  could be met in future studies  or by accu- 
mulating  knowledge;  PS3, PP1, and PP4. Reassessing  these 
variants  with further  clinical  and experimental  evidence  
could enrich  the pathogenicity  evaluation  of the detected  
variants  in such a rare disorder.  The multiple  roles of RBP3 
in the retina are poorly  understood.  Elevated  expression  of 
photoreceptor-secreted  RBP3 may have a role in protection  
against  the progression  of diabetic  retinopathy  due to hyper-  
glycemia  by inhibiting  glucose  uptake  via GLUT1  and de- 
creasing  the expression  of inflammatory  cytokines  and vas- 
cular endothelial  growth  factor (VEGF).  32 The irbp−/−KO 
mouse  shows photoreceptor  degeneration,  and markedly  re- 
duced rod and cone responses  measured  by ERG by 1 month  
of age. However,  there is only slow deterioration  in rod 
function  thereafter.  Decreased  secretion  of RBP3,  result-  
ing in increased  expression  of inflammatory  cytokines  and 
VEGF,  may be related  to the persistent  CME and the high 
prevalence  of ERM in patients  in this series. All reported  
RBP3 patients  also are highly  myopic.  In the irbp−/−KO 
mouse,  axial length  is significantly  increased  with a cor- 
responding  marked  myopic  shift. Collectively,  these data 
support  the role of IRBP in normal  eye growth  and reti- 
nal development.  High myopia  appears  to be a hallmark  
of the RBP3-  retinal  degeneration,  and targeted  screening  
of this gene may be considered  in patients  with high my- 
opia and retinal  dystrophy,  if not already  included  in panel 
screening.  • FUTURE  DIRECTIONS:  In total, only 16 patients  in 3 
studies  from 4 centers  have been reported  in the literature.  
The disease  is likely rare; however,  the nonspecific  find- 
ings in younger  patients,  such as high myopia  and normal  
fundus,  may lead to under-diagnosis  of the disease.  RBP3 
screening  in young patients  with pathologic  myopia,  with 
or without  retinal  dystrophy,  may further  help to estimate  
the prevalence  of the disease,  as well as contribute  to im- 
proved  understanding  of the disease  phenotype  and natural  
history  by identifying  more affected  individuals.  
• LIMITATIONS:  The main limitations  of our study are the 
retrospective  design,  the lack of a control  group.  and the 
variable  follow-up  duration.  Visual field data are lacking.  
Despite  these limitations,  this study provides  the most com- 
prehensive  analysis  to date of the genetic,  structural,  func- 
tional,  and clinical  characteristics  RBP3-  retinopathy,  in- 
cluding  insight  into natural  history.  
• CONCLUSIONS:  This study details  the clinical  and elec- 
trophysiological  phenotype  of RBP3 retinopathy  in the 
largest  cohort  reported  to date. RBP3 -retinopathy  is a dis- 
ease characterized  by early onset, slow progression  over 
decades,  high myopia,  and a variable  retinal  function  phe- 
notype.  The phenotypic  spectrum  and natural  history  as 
described  herein  have prognostic  and counseling  implica-  
tions. RBP3 -related  disease  should  be considered  in adults 
and children  with high myopia  and retinal  dystrophy,  with 
or without  nyctalopia.
