Abstract
Ocular manifestations are observed in approximately one third of all inherited metabolic 
disorders (IMDs). Although ocular involvement is not life-threatening, it can result in severe 
vision loss, thereby leading to an additional burden for the patient. Retinal degeneration with 
or without optic atrophy is the most frequent phenotype, followed by oculomotor problems, 
involvement of the cornea and lens, and refractive errors. These phenotypes can provide valuable 
clues that contribute to its diagnosis. In this issue we found 577 relevant IMDs leading to 
ophthalmologic manifestations. This article is the seventh of a series attempting to create and 
maintain a comprehensive list of clinical and metabolic differential diagnoses according to system 
involvement.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript1. Introduction
With this series of articles, we provide a comprehensive list of inherited metabolic disorders 
(IMDs) associated with specific organ involvement. The previous six issues are associated 
with movement disorders [ 1], metabolic liver disorders [ 2], psychiatric presentations [ 3], 
cardiovascular diseases [ 4], cerebral palsy [ 5] and skin manifestations [ 6]. This article is the 
seventh in this series and focuses on ocular phenotypes.
The list follows the classification in the knowledgebase of IMDs (IEMbase) [ 7], the 
proposed nosology of IMDs [ 8] and the international classification of IMDs (ICIMD) [ 9]. 
Data source is the IEMbase ( http://www.iembase.org ).
2. The eye
The eye is the window to the world around us. Vision enables us to be able to read, 
distinguish products at the supermarket, or recognize faces or emotions. Several studies have 
shown that about one third of IMD cohorts had ophthalmological abnormalities [ 10,11], 
resulting in partial or even total vision loss. These manifestations vary extremely and can 
be congenital or “acquired”, appearing as the first symptom of an IMD or in the advanced/
late stages of disease [ 12]. Some IMDs even present with an isolated ocular phenotype, 
i.e., without developing clinically significant manifestations in other organs. Thus, detailed 
clinical evaluation and targeted diagnostics are crucial to identify the metabolic disease, its 
prognosis and possible treatment.
The eye is located in the orbit and surrounded by the extraocular muscles that control the 
movement of the eye itself as well as the eyelids. The anatomy of the eye is well-defined 
and contains distinguishable structures (Figure 1). The anterior segment is the part of the eye 
with the cornea on the most external side. The cornea is a transparent avascular tissue that 
provides the strongest focusing power, and at the same time plays a role in protecting the 
inner eye from the external environment [ 13]. The crystalline lens additionally contributes to 
the focusing power of the eye. The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye [ 14]. 
Behind the lens, we find the vitreous chamber filled with a clear and acellular gel called 
the vitreous humor. The overall function of this compartment is to maintain the spherical 
shape of the eye. In addition, it allows the light to pass without refraction and suspends the 
lens, therefore playing an indirect role in focusing the light on the retina, which is located in 
the posterior part of the eye. The retina is a complex and specialized multilayered neuronal 
tissue consists of many subtypes of cells. In brief, the photosensitive cells (photoreceptors) 
capture the light and transform it into chemical and electrical signals that travel through 
the other layers of the retina until reaching the ganglion cells. Once there, those signals 
travel to the brain through the optic nerve, which is formed by the axons of the ganglion 
cells. Finally, the brain processes these signals and generates an image [ 15]. The pigmented 
cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) protects the photosensitive cells from 
overexposure to light as well as detoxifies and recycles certain proteins or compounds 
derived from the visual cycle and photoreceptor function [ 15]. These cells together with the 
retinal vascular endothelium form the blood-retinal barrier. All these different structures may 
be affected in IMDs.Garanto et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptOf all the IMDs with ocular phenotypes tabulated in the IEMbase (n=577, Supplemental 
Table 1), approximately 30% show involvement of the frontal part of the eye (cornea 
and lens) and around 50% of the neuroretina, with or without optic nerve involvement. 
Oculomotor manifestations appear in about 200 IMDs (~40%). The major IMDs associated 
with eye abnormalities are those related to lipid, carbohydrate, protein and metal 
metabolism. In addition, all enzymes involved in the visual cycle lead to isolated retinal 
abnormalities when mutated, despite the discrepancies between databases regarding their 
inclusion as IMDs. Overall, these ocular defects have symmetrical bilateral involvement 
[16,17]. Below we discuss some of the ocular phenotypes for a few IMDs.
3. Signs and symptoms
3.1. Extraocular structures: eyelids
Manifestations in the anterior part of the eye are frequently visible and detectable by 
external examination of the eye and the ocular adnexa. Ptosis  is the dropping of the 
eyelid. This can be caused by either damage of the nerves or the extraocular muscles. 
This sign is a common feature and despite being often overlooked it can lead to the 
identification of a severe disorder when observed during childhood [ 18]. This common 
feature is observed at all ages and can be unilateral or bilateral. Congenital ptosis of eyelid 
has been associated with neuromuscular and mitochondrial diseases [ 19]. In addition, ptosis 
has a higher prevalence in infantile cases of Pompe disease (a glycogen storage disease 
caused by pathogenic variants in GAA ), in which bilateral involvement has been observed in 
almost all cases as reported previously [ 20].
3.2. Anterior segment: cornea, iris, pupil and lens
Anterior segment manifestations can be readily detected on cursory eye examination using a 
slit lamp microscope. Frequently, the ophthalmic phenotypes are associated with opacity or 
clouding of the cornea or lens.
IMDs often present corneal opacities  or clouding. In this condition, the cornea loses its 
transparency and may even develop a cloudy/whitish appearance with advance disease. 
As a result, they can cause irritation, blurry vision, photophobia (sensitivity to light) or 
vision loss. Gaucher disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1,  in which 
all parts of the eye can be affected, but the white corneal opacities are most frequently 
reported, probably due to the accumulation of deposits of glucocerebroside [ 21]. Corneal 
opacities are also common to other lysosomal storage diseases. In fact, this distinctive 
trait is a key player in early detection and diagnosis of X-linked Fabry disease ( GLA ), 
since >70% of patients present with this symptom (cornea verticilata) [ 22]. Amongst the 
majority of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), congenital yellowish-grey color deposits of 
glycosaminoglycans progressively accumulate in all the layers of the cornea thereby leading 
to loss of visual acuity. This feature is often reported in type I, IV and VI MPS, but rarely 
in type II, and also not detected in type III MPS [ 23]. The accumulation of lipids causing 
corneal clouding is also found in patients with mucolipidoses [ 24]. In Wilson disease, a 
defect in copper metabolism, a ring consisting of copper deposits can be observed in the 
Descemet’s membrane and eventually encircling the cornea of both eyes in 65–95% of Garanto et al. Page 3
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpatients [ 25]. This manifestation is known as Kayser-Fleischer rings . A second ophthalmic 
sign caused by the deposition of copper in the anterior capsule of the lens, called sunflower 
cataract, is observed in this disease. However, it is postulated that this manifestation is not 
a pathognomonic sign of the disease [ 26]. Cystine crystals in the periphery of the cornea 
appear as of 16 month and extend with the disease progression in all forms of cystinosis 
[27–29].
Coloboma  constitutes a tissue defect of the eye, that may affect the iris, retina, choroid 
and/or optic disc. This condition occurs during eye development and can affect one 
or both eyes, but not necessarily affecting the same region. A coloboma of the iris 
is the most common type and mildest form of coloboma in IMDs. However, severe 
colobomas can also be present and they virtually affect all ocular structures causing severe 
visual dysfunction. Coloboma is frequently observed in patients suffering from congenital 
disorders of glycosylation (CDG), such as SRD5A3-CDG [ 30,31]. This phenotype has also 
been reported in uncontrolled maternal phenylketonuria and sporadic patients with other 
CDGs such as ALG2-CDG, ALG3-CDG and PIGL-CDG (CHIME syndrome) [ 32,33,24].
The iris is also affected by several IMDs. For instance, in albinism the iris is nearly 
translucent due to lack of pigmentation. This iris transillumination, however, is not exclusive 
to albinism, and is associated with other non-metabolic diseases. Albinism is caused by 
mutations in 15 genes and besides the iris transillumination, patients also present refractive 
errors like myopia, nystagmus and strabismus (see section 3.3), photophobia (sensitivity to 
light) and poor vision amongst other symptoms [ 34]. Aniridia  is a congenital condition in 
which the iris is not present. This phenotype has been reported in a large consanguineous 
Italian family suffering from hyperprolinemia type I [ 35]. This study was published in 1976 
and the gene associated with aniridia ( PAX6 ) was identified by positional cloning in 1991. 
Therefore, it is plausible that eventually pathogenic variants in PAX6  were segregating 
within the family, explaining this isolated case of a metabolic disease in combination with 
aniridia. A diminished pupillary reflex  can be observed in several IMD. In a normal 
situation, the pupil contracts in the presence of bright light to regulate the amount of light 
entering the eye, and the opposite occurs in dim light conditions. This process is regulated 
by a small group of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and examples are described in 
section 3.3.
Cataract  is an opacification of the crystalline lens, leading to decreased vision. Although 
they are commonly associated with ageing in the general population, in IMDs they may 
already present congenitally, neonatally or at different ages in life as a consequence of the 
biochemical defect.
Several IMDs manifest congenital cataract in the majority of patients: peroxisomal 
biogenesis disorders [ 36] and Lowe syndrome [ 37]. These can be initial signs that can 
contribute to the identification of the IMD. Galactosemia is an inherited recessive disease 
affecting galactose metabolism. In classical galactosemia, a significant percentage of 
patients develop bilateral cataracts in the newborn period. The cause of opacities in the 
lens is the accumulation of galactitol [ 38]. The type of cataract may be indicative of the 
underlaying IMD: e.g. galactosemia patients typically show an ‘oil droplet’ aspect of the Garanto et al. Page 4
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcataract in the nucleus of the lens [ 39]. This is one of the few symptoms that can be reversed 
upon dietary galactose restriction if initiated early [ 40]. The number of IMDs including 
cataract development in infancy and later stages increases compared to the congenital and 
neonatal stages. Nevertheless, for some IMDs this manifestation can differentially help to 
identify the metabolic cause. Some examples are sialidosis, alpha-mannosidosis, mevalonic 
aciduria, Wilson disease (see above) or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a 
rare disease affecting the breakdown of cholesterol. Patients suffering from CTX present 
early-onset cataract and chronic diarrhea. Remarkably, the ocular symptoms may precede 
other neurological and systemic manifestations [ 41].
Dislocation of the lens , also called ectopia lentis,  is another possible manifestation in IMDs. 
Classical homocystinuria is an inherited autosomal recessive disease caused by pathogenic 
variants in the CBS  gene. Lens dislocation is noticed in 35% of patients at 5 years of 
age. This number dramatically increases to 90% at the age of 25 years [ 42]. In another 
study, it was reported that 86% of patients were found to have ectopia lentis  [43]. Thus, 
classical homocystinuria should be included in the differential diagnosis of lens dislocation 
[44,45]. Due to weakness of the lens zonules, the lens of homocystinuria patients is typically 
subluxated inferiorly, in contrast to patients with Marfan syndrome, in which the lens is 
subluxated superiorly [ 46]. Similarly, lens dislocation is observed during the first year of life 
in sulfite oxidase deficiency and molybdenum cofactor-deficient patients [ 47]. Other IMDs 
can, in a very small percentage of patients, show lens dislocation. For example, ~5% of a 
cohort of 58 patients with aminoacidopathies developed this condition [ 11].
In some cases, these features may not be obvious during a general inspection due to the 
discrete involvement. Therefore, more specialized examinations may be required to rule out 
or identify mild corneal opacities, cataract or other anterior segment anomalies.
3.3. Posterior segment: retina and optic nerve
Involvement of the posterior eye relies more on the symptomatology described by the patient 
(e.g., night blindness, tunnel vision, etc.) and in-depth ophthalmic evaluation by examining 
the fundus of the eye.
3.3.1. The Retina— Retinal degeneration , especially retinal dystrophy due to 
monogenic inherited disorders, is often characterized by early-onset photoreceptor cell death 
leading to progressive loss of vision. There are multiple subtypes of retinal dystrophy and 
they are classified based on the first involved cell type in the pathology, the progression, 
or the genetic cause. For instance, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common 
retinal degeneration associated with IMDs. RP consists of the degeneration of rods, 
followed by the death of cones. This leads to night blindness, and progressive loss of 
peripheral vision (also called tunnel vision) that can ultimately result in total blindness. 
At the ophthalmologic level, RP is characterized by abnormal dark pigment in the fundus, 
decreased electrical activity of the photoreceptors (as measured by electroretinography), 
progressive reduction in the peripheral visual field, and eventually central vision loss in 
advanced disease. However, other subtypes of retinal degenerations can also be observed in 
IMDs: The retina is a highly metabolically active tissue; thus, defects in energy metabolism Garanto et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcan have a dramatically detrimental effect. Isolated retinal diseases are often caused by 
pathogenic variants in genes that affect exclusively the function of the retina. For example, 
IMDs with isolated ocular manifestations can be caused by deficiency of the enzymes 
involved in vitamin A metabolism, and therefore the visual cycle (i.e., RPE65, LRAT, 
RDH12,  etc.). Pathogenic variants in these genes lead to Leber congenital amaurosis 
(LCA), a congenital and severe form of retinal disease. Another example of IMD with a 
predominant eye phenotype is ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency, which affects 
the retina and secondarily the choroid in the form of gyrate atrophy . This condition 
leads to progressive night blindness and peripheral vision loss from the first decade of 
life onwards. Central vision and macular structure are usually preserved up to the fifth 
decade of life, after which the macula can also become affected with consequent severe 
vision loss [ 48,49]. Although the pathophysiology of the gyrate atrophy is not yet well 
understood, several hypotheses have been postulated: direct toxic effect due to ornithine 
accumulation or one of its metabolites; impairment of creatine biosynthesis due to high 
levels of ornithine; or reduction of proline levels [ 50]. Regardless of the mechanism, 
treatment with creatine supplementation did not halt progression of the disease [ 51]. 
Dietary treatment, however, has been shown to slow down disease progression to varying 
degrees, but is not preventative [ 49]. Remarkably, in hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-
homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, also characterized by high ornithine levels, no retinal 
phenotype has been reported. Conversely, similar fundus characteristics in the presence of 
normal ornithine levels are associated with iminoglycinuria. Iminoglycinuria is an autosomal 
recessive metabolic disease caused by pathogenic variants in either SLC36A2, SLC6A20  or 
SLC6A19,  which affects the renal reabsorption of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline. It is 
a condition observed in newborns whose clinical features can subside after about 6 months 
[52]. It is usually a benign disorder, though in some cases it can lead to gyrate atrophy 
[53,54].
In syndromic diseases, the eye can also be affected if the enzyme conducts a crucial 
function in the retina. As highlighted before, RP is often the most commonly observed 
retinal degeneration in many, but not all multisystemic IMDs. This is for example the 
case of several CDG. Furthermore, it is known that photoreceptors require lipids to form 
their outer segment discs, in which the visual phototransduction is initiated and the basis 
of vision lies [ 46]. Ten percent of these discs are recycled every day; therefore, it is 
expected that disruption of lipid metabolism would have a big impact on the retina. In fact, 
complex lipid disorders like Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) show skin, brain, and eye 
involvement. SLS patients present abnormal macular morphology and pigmentation with 
early onset. Intraretinal crystals detected as hyperreflective dots are visible in the retinal 
nerve fiber layer, inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer of both eyes [ 55]. With 
the progression of the disease, the central part of the retina is damaged, leading to RPE 
atrophy followed in some cases by neovascularization [ 55]. Pathogenic variants in the very 
long-chain fatty acid elongase 4 ( ELOVL4 ) have been associated with retinal phenotypes. 
Other hypothesized sphingolipid-related genes have been associated with RP. This is the 
case of CERKL . Initially, it was believed that CERKL was a ceramide kinase [ 56] and 
it was shown that its downregulation affected the levels of several sphingolipid species in Garanto et al. Page 6
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe mouse retina [ 57]. More recently, it has been shown that the CERKL protein regulates 
mitochondrial function [ 58].
Cherry-red spot  is a fundoscopic finding consisting of a small red circular shape in the 
macula that can be a key finding when diagnosing an IMD. This aspect is the result of 
a retinal edema caused by a central retinal artery occlusion or traumatic retinal ischemia. 
A cherry-red spot appearance is common in Tay-Sachs disease, acid sphingomyelinase 
deficiency, Sandhoff disease or galactosialidoses, and can be occasionally observed in 
other sphingolipidoses/lipid storage diseases such as Gaucher, Farber or Krabbe diseases 
[24,17,12,59]. In the latter case, retinal degeneration and optic atrophy are observed and can 
lead to blindness in the late stages of the disease [ 60], although optic nerve enlargement 
from globoid cell accumulation can also be seen.
Another group of IMDs which often presents with retinal degeneration is neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis. For instance, patients suffering of CLN3 disease develop early ocular 
symptoms that range from loss of visual acuity, color vision or peripheral vision that 
can be accompanied by nyctalopia, nystagmus and photophobia. With progression of the 
disease, the eyes remain normal except for the retina and optic nerve which degenerate [ 61]. 
Another subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, CLN7 caused by pathogenic variants 
in MFSD8 , is also characterized by progressive loss of vision due to retinal changes 
described as “salt and pepper” appearance. However, the first symptoms in those patients 
are generalized seizures (around 5 years of age) and within 2–3 years (around age 8) 
visual impairment is observed [ 62]. Furthermore, in the case of MFSD8- associated retinal 
phenotypes, the severity of the variant determines the degree of involvement ranging from 
isolated degeneration of the macula to a syndromic neurological disease [ 63,64].
Other diseases in which the retina is affected are errors in mitochondrial energy metabolism 
(e.g. Kearns-Sayre syndrome), copper metabolism or cobalamin C deficiency, or some 
congenital disorders of glycosylation, as well as albinism.
3.3.2. The optic nerve— Optic atrophy  is a manifestation of the degeneration of the 
optic nerve caused by multiple factors. It can result from damage of the optic nerve either 
at the retinal ganglion cells, whose axons form the optic nerve, or in the path to the brain. 
Other factors that can lead to optic atrophy are glaucoma, physical pressure on the optic 
nerve or congenital malformation of the optic nerve. Often, this degeneration leads to 
irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of optic atrophy due 
to abnormally high pressure in the eye. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is caused by pathogenic 
variants in the genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism ( SAMHD1, TREX1, RNASEH2A, 
RNASEH2B  and RNASEH2C ) and can present with congenital glaucoma as part of the 
disease manifestations [ 65]. Similarly, defects in the PEX  genes leading to peroxisome 
biogenesis disorders in the Zellweger syndrome spectrum, are known to affect nearly every 
organ, and in the eye, almost all parts can become involved. Patients suffering from these 
diseases might present multiple ocular manifestations such as corneal clouding, cataracts, 
glaucoma, retinal abnormalities and optic atrophy [ 66].Garanto et al. Page 7
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptBesides glaucoma, optic atrophy can also occur when the optic nerve has not been developed 
properly due to an inflammatory process. Several IMDs present optic atrophy, especially 
those resulting from defects in energy metabolism [ 67]. For instance, Leber hereditary 
optic neuropathy is the most common mitochondrial genetic disease and patients present 
severe loss of optic nerve fibers [ 68]. Similarly, defects in mitochondrial fusion genes, such 
as OPA1  and OPA3 , cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and autosomal 
dominant optic atrophy and cataract (ADOAC) or autosomal recessive Costeff syndrome, 
respectively. In ADOAC, cataract can also be recognized in the first decade [ 69] and the 
molecular mechanism is believed to be a dominant-negative effect. In Costeff syndrome, in 
contrast, the mechanism appears to be haploinsufficiency [ 67].
Another optic nerve-related symptom is a slow or absent pupillary reaction. A diminished 
pupillary reflex  can indicate a retinal abnormality and can be seen in nicotinamide 
mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 deficiency caused by pathogenic variants in 
NMNAT1 , or lecithin retinol acyltransferase deficiency from variants in LRAT.  In contrast, 
in other diseases with optic nerve involvement such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy 
(LHON) or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes 
(MELAS), the pupillary light reflexes are to some extent preserved [ 70].
Optic atrophies can also be found in mitochondrial energy metabolism defect such as Leigh 
syndrome, in leukodystrophies, Menkes disease, or Friedreich ataxia amongst others.
3.4. Oculomotor and refractive errors
Oculomotor or eye movement manifestations are often reported as neurological symptoms 
in IMDs [ 71]. Oculomotor errors are often caused by neuronal defects, but can also occur 
due to abnormalities of the external ocular muscles. Refractive errors are caused by light 
rays entering the eye but not focused on the retina, leading to blurred vision. Myopia  is 
a common refractive error caused by the curvature of the cornea. Interestingly, almost all 
homocystinuria patients suffer from myopia [ 72] and this trait is also prevalent in ornithine 
aminotransferase deficiency patients [ 73]. This trait is also associated with albinism patients, 
as previously described. High myopia is associated with severe degenerative abnormalities 
of the posterior part of the eye, such as macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and even a 
severe circumscribed outpouching of the wall of the globe called staphyloma [ 74].
Strabismus  is the occasional or constant misalignment of the eyes when looking at an 
object. It can be caused by muscle imbalance but also refractive errors. In IMDs, strabismus 
and nystagmus are often present simultaneously. Nystagmus  is the involuntary movement 
of the eye that has a peripheral (retina, optic nerve, and vestibular system) or central origin 
(central visual pathways, cortex, cerebellum and midbrain). This condition can present in 
different ways depending on the disease. For example, in Sandhoff disease, nystagmus 
can be accompanied with impaired horizontal and vertical saccades [ 75]. In contrast, a 
broad range of oculomotor manifestations, including nystagmus, strabismus and fixation 
problems, can be observed in several CDG [ 31]. In some cohorts of patients suffering from 
urea cycle disorders, nystagmus or strabismus have been observed in up to 33% of the 
cases [ 11]. Morquio syndrome (MPS IV A) children can present nystagmus and it has been 
suggested that these patients are slower in detecting visual targets and showed problems Garanto et al. Page 8
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmaintaining fixation [ 76,77]. Progressive ophthalmoplegia  is another condition in which 
eye movements are impaired. It can have multiple origins, usually with a neurological 
or muscular cause. It has been reported in patients suffering from PMM2-CDG [ 31], 
several mitochondrial disorders such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome [ 78], and Leigh syndrome 
[79] and lysosomal disorders like Gaucher disease or Niemann-Pick disease type C [ 80]. 
Comprehensive tables of nystagmus and other eye movement conditions in IMDs have been 
reported elsewhere [ 71,19].
4. Differential diagnosis
Ophthalmic examinations are often non-invasive and can provide essential functional 
and structural information about the eye. Initial standard ocular examination starts with 
the assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reflex, followed by an ophthalmoscopic 
examination. This technique allows the examination of the anterior segment (cornea, iris, 
lens) as well as the posterior part back of the eye including the retina and the optic 
disc. Another non-invasive structural test is optical coherence tomography (OCT), which 
allows to cross-sectionally evaluate the retina. With this technology, high resolution images 
are obtained to assess the retina and its layers at micrometer resolution. The functional 
evaluations consist of color vision and visual field testing as well as electroretinography 
(or in short ERG). The visual field test determines the area that the eye can see when 
focusing on a central point to identify blind spots. ERG is a diagnostic test that is able 
to record the electrical activity of the retina upon a light stimulation. By measuring these 
currents, it is possible to elucidate the type of cells that are affected (e.g., preferentially rod 
and/or cone photoreceptors), and provide diagnostic clues. The intraocular pressure can be 
measured using tonometers and it is an important aspect in the evaluation of glaucoma. 
Finally, fluorescein angiography is an invasive technique in which the administration 
of a specific dye allows the examination of the blood flow in the retina and can be 
combined with structural ophthalmoscopic examinations and fundus imaging. Overall, all 
these measurements can contribute to the differential diagnosis of retinal diseases.
However, the ocular manifestations in IMDs are extremely variable. While in many cases 
the ocular phenotype is an early or late manifestation of a multi-organ metabolic disease, 
in several IMDs only an isolated eye phenotype is observed. It has been postulated that 
the differences in the diseases severity might be associated to the heterogeneity of the 
gene expression and residual protein/enzyme activity [ 81]. The age at onset of the ocular 
manifestations is also variable, but many ocular complications already manifest in the first 
two decades, and sometimes even after birth. The cause of these ocular complications 
can directly be linked to the lack of a function of an enzyme, toxic effects triggered by 
abnormal metabolic products or accumulation of normal metabolites in the same pathway 
[12]. Thus, the presence of other non-related eye phenotypes affecting the skin, hearing, 
etc., might contribute to the diagnosis of the different syndromes. Of note, the co-existence 
of neurological and ocular symptoms is common to a large proportion of IMDs, making 
the differential diagnosis challenging [ 17]. Still, ocular findings not only can be extremely 
useful to raise the suspicion and the establishment of an early diagnosis of IMDs in some 
cases, but also to add clues that can help to better delineate the disease and its progression.Garanto et al. Page 9
Mol Genet Metab . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 September 24.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSome ocular abnormalities are so rare and exclusive for certain IMDs that they can strongly 
point to the exact diagnosis. For instance, reduced or absent tear production (alacrima) 
is a rare symptom that can be associated with very few IMDs, therefore facilitating the 
diagnosis of these rare diseases (e.g., claudin 10 deficiency, glycolate oxidase I deficiency, 
PIGQ-CDG, GMPPA-CDG and N-glycanase 1 deficiency).
An extremely unusual poking and rubbing of the eye, also known as Franceschetti’s oculo-
digital sign, in babies or children might highly suggest a severe early-onset retinal dystrophy 
called LCA. This condition causes early-onset blindness due to pathogenic variants in the 
genes involved in the vitamin A/visual cycle pathway, and it is often accompanied by 
nystagmus.
Biochemical diagnosis and red flags
An inherited metabolic disease should always be suspected when ocular features remain 
unexplained, once more common etiologies such as infections, ageing and focal eye lesions 
have been ruled out. Red flags suggesting that an ocular phenotype might be caused by 
an IMD include: 1) early age at onset (the earlier the onset, the more likely a metabolic 
etiology); 2) associated neurologic or extra-neurologic signs and symptoms; 3) dysmorphic 
features and/or coarsening of features; 4) progressive neurodegeneration (+/− triggered by 
catabolic stress); 5) consanguinity; 6) family history of similar disorder; 6) behavioral and/or 
psychiatric diseases; 7) paroxysmal episodic events; and 8) other sensory disorders. A list 
of laboratory investigations to aid in the diagnosis of the various listed IMDs is summarized 
in Table 1. For more details see Supplemental Table 1. When aforementioned clinical 
findings are present, a referral to a metabolic diseases specialist should be considered. The 
metabolic physician can initiate appropriate workup by ordering some of the tests mentioned 
in Table 1, depending on the specific combination of signs and symptoms. A referral to an 
ophthalmologist is often warranted for an extensive ophthalmological screening. Conversely, 
the ophthalmologist might raise suspicion of an IMD and refer to the metabolic physician 
for further evaluation. Regardless, careful examination of all eye structures is required, and 
the diagnostic approach, as with all IMDs, should prioritize treatable disorders [ 82].
We categorized the signs and symptoms of metabolic disease presenting with 
ophthalmologic features as: ‘Oculomotor involvement’, ‘Retinal involvement’, ‘Lens 
involvement’, ‘Optic nerve involvement’, ‘Corneal involvement’, ‘Refractive errors’ and 
‘Other’ (Supplemental Table 2).
Oculomotor involvement, retinal involvement, optic nerve involvement and lens involvement 
are the most common ocular abnormalities reported in 227/577 (~39%), 157/577 (~27%), 
141/577 (~24%), 117/577 (~20%) of IMDs with ophthalmologic involvement, respectively, 
followed by corneal involvement in 52/577 (~9%), and refractive errors in 32/577 (~6%) 
(Figure 2). Of the signs and symptom in the group ‘Other’, most frequently reported among 
all disorders are ‘Diminished visual activity (~80%), ‘Glaucoma’ (~37%), ‘Vision loss’ 
(~33%), ‘Total blindness’ (~29%), ‘Microphthalmia’ (~22%), ‘Coloboma’ (~13%), ‘Ocular 
albinism’ (~11%) and ‘Photophobia’ (~10%) (Supplemental Table 1). Some of them are, 
however, specific for particular disorder groups, e.g., ‘Glaucoma’ in disorders of nucleotide Garanto et al. Page 10

in disorders of lysosome-related organelle biogenesis.
It is often challenging, however, to identify an IMD based on an early ocular phenotype. 
First, one third of all IMDs can present some type of ocular manifestation. Furthermore, 
clinical ophthalmologic symptoms often overlap between different diseases. The overall 
picture becomes more complicated if we consider that several IMDs present exclusively with 
ocular defects, but at the same time, deficiencies in the same pathway can result in different 
outcomes. In that sense, genetic analysis to pinpoint a specific genetic defect is a very 
powerful tool to help in solving the puzzle [ 83]. Furthermore, identifying the genetic cause 
of the disease can also contribute to determining a possible therapeutic intervention [ 84]. 
Early management of ocular symptoms can improve the quality of life of these patients. 
For instance, pathogenic variants in ELOVL4  can result in a dominant form of Stargardt 
Disease 3 (STGD3) with only retinal involvement; pathogenic variants in the same gene 
can lead to pseudo-Sjögren-Larsson syndrome or spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 [ 85]. This 
is also the case of the OPA3 -associated diseases described previously. Other examples in 
which genetics plays a crucial role to understand the outcome and progression of possible 
multisystemic IMD include lysosomal storage diseases. For instance, pathogenic variants 
in HGSNAT  and MFSD8  have been classified as severe or mild [ 86,87]. Severe variants 
in these genes lead to MPS 3C (Sanfilippo syndrome type C) or CLN7, respectively; 
mild variants, on the other hand, cause isolated retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or macular 
degeneration, respectively. Thus, establishing proper genotype-phenotype correlations is 
crucial for some IMDs.
Isolated ocular manifestations are usually present as RP or LCA, and they are caused 
by pathogenic variants in the IMD-related genes IMPDH1, NMNAT1, IDH3A, IDH3B, 
SLC7A14  or LRAT  [88–93]. Interestingly, variants in the IMD-associated mitochondrial 
genes MT-TH  and MT-TS2  have been associated with both RP and hearing loss, as is 
the case for variants in ARSG  [94–96]. Furthermore, the optic nerve can be involved 
in conditions caused by variants in genes associated with metabolic pathways such as 
RTN4IP1, TMEM126A  (both leading to optic atrophy) and OAT  (causing gyrate atrophy)
[97–99]. Variants in the glutamate metabotropic receptor 6 ( GRM6 ) are responsible 
for congenital stationary blindness [ 100]. Except for IMPDH1  (autosomal dominant 
inheritance) and mitochondrial genes, all other causal variants for metabolic conditions with 
isolated ocular phenotypes are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
In conclusion, a low threshold for ophthalmological evaluation is necessary for all IMDs, as 
phenotypes have yet to be fully delineated, and repeated exams are often required to screen 
for disease progression, especially since IMDs can have unpredictable courses [ 17].
5. Prognosis and treatment
Depending on the part of the eye affected, the symptoms and possible treatments will differ. 
While some forms of involvement in the frontal part of the eye such as corneal opacity or 
cataracts can be corrected by surgery (e.g., corneal transplants), in contrast the majority of 
the defects in the neuroretina are not treatable yet. However, the eruption of genetic and Garanto et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmolecular therapies for the eye has shown that progression of photoreceptor degeneration 
can be halted or slowed down, significantly improving the life of the patient [ 101]. In fact, 
the first gene therapy was marketed for an autosomal recessive form of retinal degeneration 
caused by variants in RPE65 , which is involved in the metabolism of the vitamin A [ 102]. 
Furthermore, a customized RNA-based molecule (antisense oligonucleotide) for a patient 
suffering CLN7 caused by a splicing variant in MFSD8  was delivered to the brain to 
ameliorate the seizures [ 103]. Unfortunately, this child already lost her vision before the 
initiation of treatment; still the delivery of these molecules to the eye has been shown to be 
safe and well tolerated [ 104]. Currently, many other genetic therapies are being investigated 
at preclinical and clinical levels. However, these potential treatments are often variant- or 
gene-specific and aim to treat disease with only retinal manifestations. Unfortunately, for 
most of IMDs the ocular phenotypes are often secondary and eclipsed by life-threatening 
manifestations in other organs which require urgent intervention if possible.
Supplemental Table 1 includes information on primary treatment options for the mentioned 
IMDs, i.e., treatment that addresses at least one aspect of the pathophysiology of the 
disease, when available. Strategies vary from vitamin/cofactor/amino acid supplements, 
dietary restriction (e.g., protein, fat), chelation therapy, pharmacologic treatment, and organ 
transplants. Often these interventions are disease modifying only. With the advent of stem 
cell transplantation and genetic therapies, the future looks brighter as a cure is in sight. Early 
diagnosis is essential, as this optimizes the window of opportunity; newborn screening has 
proven an excellent tool for prevention altogether, but not all IMD are covered due to the 
limited amount unique and stable biomarkers.
