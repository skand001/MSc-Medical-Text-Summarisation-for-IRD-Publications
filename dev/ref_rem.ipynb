    "Abstract: Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of blinding diseases, typically involving\n",
    "a progressive loss of photoreceptors. The IRD pathology is often based on an accumulation of cGMP\n",
    "in photoreceptors and associated with the excessive activation of calpain and poly (ADP-ribose)\n",
    "polymerase (PARP). Inhibitors of calpain or PARP have shown promise in preventing photoreceptor\n",
    "cell death, yet the relationship between these enzymes remains unclear. To explore this further,\n",
    "organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type and IRD-mutant mice were treated\n",
    "with inhibitors speciﬁc for calpain, PARP , and voltage-gated Ca2+channels (VGCCs). The outcomes\n",
    "were assessed using in situ activity assays for calpain and PARP and immunostaining for activated\n",
    "calpain-2, poly (ADP-ribose), and cGMP , as well as the TUNEL assay for cell death detection. The IRD\n",
    "models included the Pde6b-mutant rd1mouse and rd1*Cngb1\u0000/\u0000double-mutant mice, which lack the\n",
    "beta subunit of the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel and are partially protected from rd1\n",
    "degeneration. We conﬁrmed that an inhibition of either calpain or PARP reduces photoreceptor cell\n",
    "death in rd1retina. However, while the activity of calpain was decreased by the inhibition of PARP ,\n",
    "calpain inhibition did not alter the PARP activity. A combination treatment with calpain and PARP\n",
    "inhibitors did not synergistically reduce cell death. In the slow degeneration of rd1*Cngb1\u0000/\u0000double\n",
    "mutant, VGCC inhibition delayed photoreceptor cell death, while PARP inhibition did not. Our\n",
    "results indicate that PARP acts upstream of calpain and that both are part of the same degenerative\n",
    "pathway in Pde6b-dependent photoreceptor degeneration. While PARP activation may be associated\n",
    "with CNG channel activity, calpain activation is linked to VGCC opening. Overall, our data highlights\n",
    "PARP as a target for therapeutic interventions in IRD-type diseases.\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a genetically diverse group of diseases that\n",
    "typically result in progressive photoreceptor cell death, severe visual handicap, and blind-\n",
    "ness [ 1]. The most common disease within the IRD group is retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [ 2],\n",
    "in which patients initially experience night blindness and gradual constriction of the visual\n",
    "ﬁeld due to primary loss of rod photoreceptors. This is followed by secondary degeneration\n",
    "Biomolecules 2022, 12, 455. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12030455 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\n",
    "Biomolecules 2022, 12, 455 2 of 21\n",
    "of cone photoreceptors, eventually resulting in complete blindness [ 3]. Approximately one\n",
    "in four thousand people are affected by RP [ 2]. IRD-type blinding diseases are generally\n",
    "considered to be untreatable [ 4]. The second messenger cyclic-guanosine-monophosphate\n",
    "(cGMP) has been found to play a central role in the pathobiology of many genetically\n",
    "distinct types of IRD [ 5], and excessive cGMP-signaling may be directly or indirectly asso-\n",
    "ciated with the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cyclic nucleotide-gated\n",
    "(CNG) channels, and calpain-type proteases [5–7].\n",
    "One of the best studied animal models for IRD is the rd1mouse (retinal degenera-\n",
    "tion 1), a naturally occurring mouse model ﬁrst described by Keeler in the early 1920s [ 8].\n",
    "Inrd1mice, the gene encoding for the beta subunit of the rod photoreceptor-speciﬁc\n",
    "phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) is mutated [ 9], causing PDE6 dysfunction, accumulation of\n",
    "cGMP in rod photoreceptors, and primary rod cell death, followed by secondary cone\n",
    "photoreceptor cell loss [ 10,11]. The degeneration of rods in the rd1mouse is associated\n",
    "with a prominent activation of both PARP and calpain [ 12,13]. In humans, 4 to 5% of IRD\n",
    "patients carry mutations in PDE6 genes, making it seem likely that they will also suffer from\n",
    "high cGMP levels and the corresponding up-regulation of downstream cGMP-signaling\n",
    "targets [14].\n",
    "PARP is a DNA repair enzyme [ 15] and catalyzes ADP-ribose transfer to target pro-\n",
    "teins [ 16]. It can sequentially add ADP-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\n",
    "(NAD+) to form polymeric ADP-ribose (PAR) chains [ 17]. The enzymatic activity of PARP\n",
    "has been related to a variety of different cellular functions, including DNA repair and\n",
    "transcription, regulation of gene expression, metabolism, and aging [ 18]. However, PARP\n",
    "may also be the primary driver for a speciﬁc form of cell death, termed PARthanatos [ 19].\n",
    "The current view is that in IRD nonapoptotic cGMP-dependent cell death is characterized\n",
    "by PARP over-activation and the accumulation of PAR [ 14], indicating a possible crosstalk\n",
    "between cGMP signaling and PARthanatos [6].\n",
    "Calpain is a Ca2+-dependent thiol protease, which has been implicated in fundamental\n",
    "cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation [ 20]. The\n",
    "Ca2+inﬂux required for calpain activation may occur via CNG channels located in the\n",
    "plasma membrane of the photoreceptor outer segment. These channels are gated by cGMP ,\n",
    "which is often elevated in retinal degeneration [ 7,21,22]. The activation of CNG channels\n",
    "leads to a depolarization of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, which activates synaptic\n",
    "voltage-gated Ca2+channels (VGCCs), increasing the synaptic and cytosolic Ca2+levels [ 23].\n",
    "The inﬂux of Ca2+via CNG channels and/or VGCC is thought to cause the activation of\n",
    "calpain-type proteases, which may promote cell destruction [24–27].\n",
    "In IRD, PARP and calpain have been suggested to be part of two independent cell\n",
    "death subroutines, both of which are triggered by elevated levels of cGMP [ 5]. On the other\n",
    "hand, PARP is known to be cleaved by calpain, indicating that calpain could potentially\n",
    "control PARP activity [ 28,29]. Conversely, in a model for NMDA toxicity in rat primary\n",
    "cortical neurons, PARP was found to regulate the calpain activity via mitochondrial Ca2+\n",
    "homeostasis [ 30]. We hypothesized that PARP and calpain crosstalk could also occur\n",
    "during cGMP-dependent cell death in IRD. To investigate this possibility, we used speciﬁc\n",
    "inhibitors for PARP , calpain, and VGCC to block the corresponding downstream pathways\n",
    "and assessed the contribution of the rod CNG channel via knockout of its beta subunit.\n",
    "Through these interventions, we show that (1) calpain and PARP are part of the same\n",
    "degenerative pathway triggered by high levels of cGMP in photoreceptors and that (2)\n",
    "PARP controls calpain activity, likely indirectly via CNG channel activity and excessive\n",
    "demands on energy metabolism.\n",

    "subunits [ 49]. Loss of the Cngb1 subunit leads to degradation of the Cnga1 subunit and,\n",
    "essentially, loss of the rod CNG channel, thus eliminating the cGMP-gated dark current and\n",
    "preventing the rods from responding to light by hyperpolarization [ 49]. In the rd1model,\n",
    "the aberrantly high levels of cGMP lead to over-activation of the CNG channels and, thus,\n",
    "to increased Na+- and Ca2+- inﬂux and persistent depolarization [ 7]. Paradoxically, in the\n",
    "Cngb1 knockout model, where rods lose the ability of light-dependent hyperpolarization,\n",
    "the resting membrane potential remains essentially unchanged, and the cells are constantly\n",
    "depolarized [ 46]. In rd1rod photoreceptors, the strong Na+- and Ca2+- inﬂux that the CNG\n",
    "channel mediates in its open state needs to be counterbalanced, a function that is fulﬁlled\n",
    "by the ATP-driven Na+/K+exchanger (NKX). Importantly, NKX activity alone represents\n",
    "at least 50% of the total ATP expenditure of a photoreceptor, thereby linking CNG channel\n",
    "activity to energy metabolism [50,51].\n",
    "Genetic deletion of the Cngb1 subunit of the rod CNG channel affords robust rd1\n",

    "progression. Moreover, the combined inhibition of VGCC and the CNG channel could\n",
    "interrupt Ca2+homeostasis and cause severe photoreceptor degeneration [ 53]. On the other\n",
    "hand, when we used D-cis-diltiazem on rd1*Cngb1\u0000/\u0000mice, photoreceptor cell death was\n",
    "reduced, suggesting that D-cis-diltiazem could potentially exert therapeutic effects in the\n",
    "absence of CNG channel function. Although D-cis-diltiazem has been reported to partially\n",
    "inhibit CNG channels in rod outer segments [ 54,55], our data indirectly rule out that it had\n",
    "an effect on rod degeneration in rd1retinal explants.\n",
    "4.3. P ARP Regulates Calpain via a Pathway That Depends on CNG Channel Function\n",
    "An abnormal activation of P ARP in degenerating photoreceptors is well-documented [ 5,6,56,57],\n",
    "and accordingly, the PARP inhibitor Olaparib decreased photoreceptor cell death, consistent\n",
    "with previous studies [ 13,58–61]. PARP inhibitors are primarily used for cancer therapy due\n",
    "Biomolecules 2022, 12, 455 13 of 21\n",
    "to their ability to prevent DNA repair, and several PARP inhibitors are being tested clinically\n",
    "or have already been approved for clinical use [ 62]. Notably, Olaparib became the ﬁrst PARP\n",
    "inhibitor to be approved by the FDA to treat metastatic breast cancer in January 2018 [ 63].\n",
    "Currently, Olaparib is the most speciﬁc PARP inhibitor available and has no binding to\n",
    "392 unique human kinases [ 64]. Among the known off targets is inosine monophosphate\n",
    "dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) [ 65], which shares 84% sequence homology with IMPDH1,\n",
    "an isozyme that is strongly expressed in the retina [ 66]. Since IMPDH1 catalyzes the\n",
    "rate-limiting step of GTP production, the substrate employed by retinal guanylate cyclase\n",
    "(retGC) for cGMP synthesis [ 14], an off-target inhibition of IMPDH1 by Olaparib could\n",
    "potentially reduce cGMP production [ 67]. However, our cGMP immunostaining revealed\n",
    "that the number of cGMP-positive cells in the rd1retina was not decreased in the Olaparib-\n",
    "treated group when compared to the control, suggesting that interactions of Olaparib with\n",
    "IMPDH1 were not responsible for the effects observed.\n",
    "PARP activity consumes large amounts of NAD+with important ramiﬁcations for cell\n",
    "metabolism. Since the biosynthesis of NAD+occurs directly from nicotinamide mononu-\n",
    "cleotide (NMN) and ATP via nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NM-\n",
    "NATs), excessive consumption of NAD+can lead to ATP depletion [ 68]. Additionally,\n",
    "NAD+is a key substrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and its deﬁciency could result in\n",
    "mitochondrial dysfunction [ 69], which can further aggravate ATP depletion [ 70]. Moreover,\n",
    "PARP joins ADP-ribose units from NAD+to form PAR [ 17], high levels of which may\n",
    "also induce mitochondrial dysfunction [ 71]. The dysfunction induced by NAD+depletion\n",
    "and/or PAR accumulation may depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential and open\n",
    "the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [ 72], which could then release mitochondrial\n",
    "Ca2+to the cytoplasm and activate Ca2+-dependent proteases [ 73–75]. Therefore, it appears\n",
    "likely that PARP inhibition, through reduced NAD+consumption and PAR generation, will\n",
    "alleviate mitochondrial stress. This, in turn, should increase the availability of ATP that\n",
    "may be used to, for instance, drive the plasma membrane Ca2+- ATPase (PMCA), which, in\n",
    "turn, will reduce the intracellular Ca2+- levels and, thus, calpain activity.\n",
    "Inrd1*Cngb1\u0000/\u0000mice, the lack of CNGB1 strongly reduces the Na+- and Ca2+- in-\n",

    "calpain-2 activation, or photoreceptor cell death. This points to a mechanism where CNG\n",

    "of photoreceptor cell death. On the other hand, in rd1*Cngb1\u0000/\u0000retinal explants, D-cis-\n",
    "diltiazem treatment reduced PARP activity. This suggests that, in the absence of CNG\n",
    "channel function, PARP activity is dependent, at least in part, on VGCC-mediated Ca2+-\n",
    "inﬂux. Indeed, PARP activity has been associated with elevated intracellular Ca2+- lev-\n",
    "els [77–79], and it is thus conceivable that both CNG channels and/or VGCCs contribute\n",
    "to PARP activation. The exact nature of this detrimental interaction between CNG chan-\n",
    "nels, VGCCs, and PARP remains unclear but could potentially be related to alterations\n",
    "of Na+- and Ca2+- homeostasis and the increased demands on cellular metabolism that\n",
    "this represents. Moreover, because of the rapid degeneration phenotype in rd1mice, the\n",
    "results obtained here relate to retina that is still not fully developed and immature. Future\n",
    "studies may reveal to what extent the results obtained in early postnatal retina can be\n",
    "extended to mature adult retina and, if so, how this may apply to IRD patients. At any\n",
    "rate, in genetically very heterogenous IRDs, these ﬁndings, together with the fact that\n",

    "In the following we will attempt to summarize the main results of this study and\n",
