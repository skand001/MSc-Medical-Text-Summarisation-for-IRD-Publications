The neural retina comprises several distinct layers. Photoreceptor nuclei form the Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL). Photoreceptor cells form synaptic connections with downstream inter-neurons in the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL). Nuclei of Bipolar Cells, Horizontal Cells, and some Amacrine Cells comprise the Inner Nuclear Layer (INL).

CONCLUSIONS: This study details the clinical and functional phenotype of RBP3 -retinopathy in the largest cohort reported to date. RBP3 -retinopathy is a disease characterized by early onset, slow progression over decades, and high myopia. The phenotypic spectrum and natural history as described herein has prognostic and counseling implications. RBP3 -related disease should be considered in children with high myopia and retinal dystrophy. OCT showed cystoid macular edema at presentation in 3

With a current global population of approximately 7.8 billion [ 18], it is estimated that approximately 2 million people currently have some form of IRD. As a global community involved in ocular genetics, the common goal is to achieve a diagnostic success rate of 100% for all IRD patients enrolled in clinical studies. This objective, however, presents several challenges. Firstly, over 270 genes have been associated with the aetiologies of IRDs (RetNet, Retinal Information Network, https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/ accessed on 20 April ) [ 19]. Furthermore, extensive diversity in clinical presentation due to mutations even within a single IRD gene, as well as intersecting clinical phenotypes and phenocopies, is encountered. Mutations in disease genes may affect the retina in isolation, or may have more systemic effects. For example, there are 80 systemic conditions with a retinal phenotype and 200 genes that not only affect retinal health but also the central nervous system, kidneys or heart [ 20]. Such complexity makes it near-impossible for a diagnosis to be achieved in most instances solely on the basis of disease phenotype [ 2,2123]. Furthermore, even a single pathogenic variant can manifest with phenotypic variability [ 24]. For some IRDs, modifier loci have been identified, somewhat blurring the borders between Int. J. Mol. Sci. ,22, 5684 2 of 20 Mendelian and polygenic forms of IRD and mirroring similar observations with other disease aetiologies [25,26]. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the NGS strategies employed globally to maximise the detection of IRD-causing mutations. This includes the use of targeted gene panels for all IRD phenotypes or phenotypic subs

It is even more suitable than NEI VFQ55 based on the length of the test and its feasibility while keeping the same comprehensiveness.1416 There is no comprehensive information regarding VRQoL among Iranian patients who suffer from different types of IRDs.17 However, in other countries, extensive studies were performed on these patients. Only one study was performed on patients with RP that showed that mean NEI VFQ25 scores were low in 35 RP patients, and decreased visual acuity (V A) has a great impact on the QoL.

The onset of these conditions is usually between early childhood and late adolescence [3, 810]. Due to disease heterogeneity and the overlap of mani - festations among different IRDs, achieving a definite clinical diagnosis is often difficult and requires a multi - disciplinary effort combining several different assessment techniques [7, 11]. Determining IRD-causing gene vari - ants has also proven complex. However, recent improve - ments in genome sequencing techniques (notably, the introduction of next-generation sequencing, NGS) have considerably advanced the molecular diagnosis of IRDs [10, 12, 13]. Consequently, establishing the genotype of IRDs is increasingly considered an essential component of the diagnostic workup. The approval in  of voretigene neparvovec, a gene therapy indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with vision loss due to inherited retinal dystrophy caused by confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations [14, 15], has raised great expectations and provided further support for the need for molecular diagnosis [12, 16, 17]. The field of IRDs is rapidly evolving, as other gene ther - apies are under development [1, 18]. These changes pose new challenges to clinicians treating patients with IRDs, including pediatricians, child neuropsychiatrists, and general ophthalmologists. It has become apparent that best-practice care for patients necessitates the involve - ment of a broad multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of IRDs and including specialists in retinal diseases, the genetics of hereditary retinal dystro - phies, vitreoretinal surgery, molecular biology, patient support, and other technical and bioinformatic aspects of IRDs. In fact, the ideal approach should go beyond the mult
