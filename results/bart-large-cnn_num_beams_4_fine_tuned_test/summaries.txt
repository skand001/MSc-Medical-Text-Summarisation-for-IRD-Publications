es caused disease in five or fewer families (i.e., 0.5% or less). Disease-causing genotypes were identified in 576 of the families without next generation sequencing (NGS). This included 23 families with mutations in the repetitive region of RPGR exon 15 that would have been missed by NGS. Whole exome sequencing of the remaining 424 families revealed mutations in an additional 182, and whole genome sequencing of four of the remaining 242 families revealed two additional genotypes that were invisible by the other methods.

The non-exomic mutation would not have been captured by any currently available commercial exome capture reagents. Patient E is the 42-year-old father of patient D who first noticed difficulty with his central vision at age 6 (Supplemental Table 1, #804). The following year he was diagnosed with Stargardt disease and by age 13 his acuity had fallen to 20/400 OD and 20/240 OS. On this visit, his acuity was 20/800 OD and 20/250 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed an elliptical zone of RPE and choriocapillaris atrophy centered on fixation, very narrowed arterioles, and extensive bone-spicule like pigment in the midperiphery OU (Figure 10A). Optical coherence tomography (Figure 10B) revealed preservation of inner retinal lamination even in the area of macular atrophy. Goldman perimetry revealed complete loss of sensitivity to the I4e stimulus throughout the visual field and an absolute scotoma inferonasally OU (Figure 10C). This patient shared the IVS36+1216 C>A non-exomic mutation with his daughter and harbored an Arg2077Trp variant on his other allele. ,  found the Arg2077Trp variant to be the most severe Stargardt allele of the sixteen they evaluated 39. This is consistent with the more severe RP-like phenotype in this individual. Data that are used to arrive at a diagnosis are often incomplete, noisy and somewhat biased. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment outcomes are also dependent upon individual patient variation, the point in the disease course that a treatment is administered, and in some cases, the skill of a surgeon in delivering a treatment to the desired anatomic location. Most physicians effectively combat these challenges with systematic actions, good record keeping and periodic review of their outcomes in the context of new knowledge. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical and molecular findings from 1,000 consecutive families affected with inherited retinal disease  in the context of current technology, public databases and literature  to identify opportunities for improving our accuracy and efficiency in arriving at clinical and molecular diagnoses for patients with inherited retinal diseases. The consecutive nature of the ascertainment allows a rough approximation of the total numbers of individuals in the United States who are affected by various categories of disease (Table 3). These data may be useful as scientists try to devise and implement practical comprehensive strategies for reaching all such patients with some type of useful treatment. The clinical classification system used in this study (Figure 1, Table 2) is an empiric, internally consistent shorthand that can be used to efficiently  Page 11 Ophthalmology . Author manuscript; available in PMC  September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptobservations to the laboratory for the purpose of guiding their molecular investigations, analyses and interpretations, and to align the resulting genotype-phenotype correlations with the constantly changing medical literature. This system was devised by a single clinician over many years and should not be considered a consensus view of how these disorders can be most meaningfully arranged. It is expected and desirable that other physicians will add or subtract categories from this classification scheme as needed to encompass the patients they see in their practice, and to move the clinical entities around to better reflect the order in which they typically pursue a diagnostic workup and the specific diagnostic instruments routinely available to them. The power of this approach lies not in the details of the classification system but in the idea of using clinical information to narrow the pretest hypothesis for the purpose of increasing the sensitivity of the testing and dramatically increasing the statistical significance of the results. To reduce the FGR below 5%, which would be desirable when contemplating a significant intervention such as gene replacement therapy or the preimplantation selection of embryos for disease avoidance, one would need to reduce the pretest hypothesis in most cases to fewer than ten genes (e.g., category IA2b, Figure 1). More than 85% of the terminal categories in the current classification scheme have a FGR of 5% or less (blue bars, Figure 1). The remaining task for clinicians who care for patients with inherited retinal diseases is to carefully scrutinize the ones in the more genetically heterogeneous categories (grey bars, Figure 1) for subtle clinical signs that can be used to further subdivide them into entities associated with a smaller number of genes. Over time, some diagnostic categories and classification arrangements will prove more useful than others for this purpose and an optimal scheme for all inherited eye disease can evolve by combining the best features of many classifications based upon their performance in the pretest prediction of the patients' genotypes. There are many different strategies that one can use to analyze a patient's DNA for the presence of disease-causing sequence variations and a complete discussion of them is well beyond the scope of this paper. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to think of the many possibilities in terms of four attributes: 1) the degree to which a test can be customized to detect specific variations that would otherwise be missed; 2) the degree to which the test yields a dataset that can be re-analyzed in the future to discover currently unrecognized pathogenic variations; 3) the degree to which multiple platforms are employed to maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of each; and, 4) the degree to which the patients' true disease-causing genotypes will be obscured by normal, non-disease-causing genetic variation. Next generation sequencing panels have now been designed for many diseases and have the advantages that they are relatively focused (compared to whole exome or whole genome tests), they can be customized to include specific non-exomic regions known to cause disease, and they are relatively quick and inexpensive to perform. The disadvantage of such panels is that when negative, they do not allow wider analytical exploration in search of disease-causing mutations outside the genomic space covered by the panel's design. These panels have difficulty in accurately detecting variants within repetitive DNA sequences and can have difficulty detecting deletions larger than 100 nucleotides and smaller than a few exons in size. Moreover, most of these panels evaluate a sufficient number of genes that the false genotype rate associated with them is greater than 5% unless the  Page 12 Ophthalmology . Author manuscript; available in PMC  September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcontrols this by making a firm and narrow pre-test diagnosis and rigorously evaluates the results in that context. Whole exome sequencing has the advantage of sampling nearly all of the transcribed sequences in the human genome and can be subjected to very focused analysis to yield statistically meaningful results. If such a focused analysis is negative, the data can be reanalyzed to consider a larger portion of the exome and/or reanalyzed at a later date when new regions of the exome may have been discovered to cause a phenotype similar to the patient under study. The disadvantages of whole exome sequencing are that it is more expensive and time consuming to perform than a next generation sequencing panel and most commercial whole exome reagents are not easily customizable to analyze specific nonexomic regions of interest to specific subspecialties of medicine. Whole exome sequencing also has difficulty with repetitive DNA and can have even greater difficulty detecting single exon deletions than NGS-based panels 40,41. As shown in Figure 5, unless one establishes a narrow pretest hypothesis and evaluates the results accordingly, whole genome sequencing will frequently have a false genotype rate that is so high that the results should be considered hypothesis generating at best. Whole genome sequencing evaluates nearly all of the non-repetitive sequences in the genome and, although it examines more than fifty times more sequence than whole exome sequencing, is surprisingly only about twice as expensive as the latter method. It is better at detecting deletions, duplications and inversions than whole exome sequencing 42 and can also detect disease-causing variations in non-exomic space 33,43-45. However, the amount of background genetic variation in the nonexomic space is so large, and our current understanding of the function of nonexomic sequences is currently so limited, that pathogenic single nucleotide variations will be completely hidden in the noise unless the pretest hypothesis is limited to only one or two genes and some functional test can be employed to validate the findings functionally 29,33,46. For example, the identification of a number of non-exomic mutations in ABCA4 28 required access to a large cohort of patients with convincing clinical characteristics of Stargardt disease and only a single diseasecausing mutation, as well as a rather narrow mechanistic hypothesis, altered splicing, coupled with a convincing assay of this mechanism. Similarly, the discovery of the nonexomic mutations responsible for North Carolina Macular Dystrophy required decades of clinical and molecular genetic work to narrow the genetic interval to less than a million base pairs as well as sufficient families to identify three different mutations tightly clustered in a single regulatory element 33. It is also important to remember that none of the commonly utilized high-throughput sequencing methods can unambiguously distinguish whether two different mutations observed in a patient were inherited from a single parent, which would not be expected to cause autosomal recessive disease, or whether they were inherited from both parents. The phase of two variants is most reliably established by testing a parent or child of the proband but in many cases can also be determined by testing siblings or more distant relatives. In multiplex families, confirming that all affected individuals actually harbor the genotype found in the proband also increases the likelihood that that genotype is truly diseasecausing 18. By reporting such properly segregating genotypes in the literature or through a  Page 13 Ophthalmology . Author manuscript; available in PMC  September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcurated database (e.g., vvd.eng.uiowa.edu), one can strengthen the confidence in those mutations for other physicians caring for other families. It should go without saying that there is no need to employ the same genotyping strategy for every patient. Some phenotypes are so characteristic that they yield a pre-test hypothesis that can be evaluated with a single conventional DNA sequencing reaction, which costs less than $20 in the research setting (see Methods). Other phenotypes are associated with a small number of genes that can still be analyzed more quickly and with less financial and statistical cost than an entire exome or genome sequence would incur (Figures 4 and 5). In this study, we divided all of the inherited eye diseases seen by a single clinician over a 5.5 year period into 62 different categories and for all but 7 of these categories were able to devise very focused tests that cost less than an entire exome to perform. We reserved whole exome sequencing for the few clinical categories that were too broad for focused screening and for the cases that were negative after the initial test. We reserved whole genome sequencing for four families that had a phenotype that strongly implicated a single gene (e.g., Patient B, Figure 7) but had no mutations in the coding sequences of that gene. Although this tiered approach resulted in some patients having two or even three molecular evaluations, the focused tests were so inexpensive  less than half the cost of an exome on average  that the tiered strategy was overall less expensive than it would have been if we performed whole exome sequencing on every patient (Figure 4). The very customized nature of the prescreening tests also allowed very challenging portions of the genome to be successfully analyzed, such as the highly repetitive portion of exon 15 in RPGR that is uninterpretable with most next generation sequencing methods. As a result, the sensitivity of our current tiered approach is a 6.1% higher than an all whole exome sequencing strategy would be. Although the tiered strategy is currently 17.7% less expensive overall in our hands than an all whole exome sequencing approach would be in the same laboratory using the same personnel, this modest overall cost savings is not the main reason that we would employ or recommend this approach. The main reasons are to keep the average FGR as low as possible and to detect important disease-causing mutations that would otherwise be missed (Patients A  C, Figures 6  8). The clinical pre-test decision making necessary to achieve the low FGR results in a very low test cost for a large fraction of the patients (Figure 4). This savings in reagent cost and laboratory bandwidth can then be used to pursue much more expensive investigations, such as cloning the repetitive region of RPGR exon 15, in the subset of patients that need it. This results in a higher overall sensitivity of the strategy at a lower cost. It is important to note that as the cost of whole exome sequencing and the associated analysis continues to fall, it will not supplant the value of specific pre-screening tests for many clinical categories until the whole exome sequencing cost falls below that of a single Sanger sequencing reaction. Thirteen of the 25 families with clinical BBS in this cohort had their mutations found in BBS1 , and all 13 of these harbored at least one M390R allele. As a result, we would recommend performing a Sanger sequencing reaction in search of this mutation in all BBS patients before proceeding to whole exome sequencing until the total cost of the latter falls below fifty dollars. Page 14 Ophthalmology . Author manuscript; available in PMC  September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIt is interesting to consider what would happen to the data shown in Figures 4 and 5 if the research cost of whole exome and whole genome sequencing became one tenth what it is today (i.e., $120 and $245 per person, respectively). At these price points, the cost of the sequencing would be dwarfed by the cost of the sample handling, quality control measures, bioinformatic analysis, report writing and genetic counseling. As a result, our ratio of whole exome sequencing to whole genome sequencing would likely be the inverse of what it is today and we would also perform many fewer prescreening tests. Most of the latter would be performed to cover the low complexity parts of the genome that will continue to elude scrutiny by NGS methods. The overall sensitivity of the testing strategy would increase a few percent because whole genome sequencing is better at detecting copy number variations. However, the need for a narrow pre-test hypothesis would be identical to the need today because the average false genotype rate per base pair of investigated genome is an immutable fact of nature that is completely unaffected by the costs of the methods we employ or the speed with which we employ them. One might expect that our next step in studying the cohort presented in this paper would be to perform whole genome sequencing in the 240 families that have yet to have their diseasecausing mutations identified. However, it is important to note that these families harbor an average of 16.5 plausible disease-causing mutations among the 305 candidate genes we considered in this study (Figure 1). It seems most likely to us that the majority of the genotypes remaining to be discovered in this cohort lie at least in part among the coding sequence variations that we have already detected or the coding sequences of other genes and that further clinical investigation of these families is likely to be more fruitful than increasing the number of rare variants to consider by more than two orders of magnitude. The aggressive ascertainment of additional members of these 240 families will allow us to strengthen or rule out many of the plausible disease-causing variants we have already identified on the basis of their segregation within the families. Continued scrutiny of the positive families in this cohort may also reveal some characteristic clinical features that would favor a specific one-allele hypothesis sufficiently that whole genome sequencing would be indicated in that family. This families first strategy would not change even if the cost of whole genome sequencing fell ten-fold. As noted above, the reason for this is that the amount of normal genetic variation in the genome is extremely large and independent of sequencing cost. The most powerful resources for overcoming this noise are, and will continue to be, large and well-characterized patient resources 28,33. The disadvantages of a tiered testing strategy are that it requires very accurate communication between the clinic and the laboratory to gain the benefits described in this study, and tiered tests take much longer to perform than fragment capture panels. Although there are few situations in which a 3 or 4 month difference in testing time is clinically significant for a patient with a slowly progressive retinal degeneration, it is unquestionable that many families are anxious to have the cause of their disease identified as quickly as possible. The keys to keeping the FGR down and sensitivity high are to 1) make the best clinical diagnosis possible before ordering a genetic test and use this diagnosis to choose the simplest test that is likely to yield a finding for that diagnosis, 2) obtain  Page 15 Ophthalmology . Author manuscript; available in PMC  September 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptparents and siblings of simplex families and as many affected individuals as possible from multiplex pedigrees for use in evaluating the results in the proband, 3) know the cost breakpoint between multiple focused prescreens and whole exome sequencing and switch to whole exome sequencing before exceeding that breakpoint, 4) take advantage of the slow progression of most of these diseases by trying to have a result for the patient at their next visit instead of some arbitrarily short turnaround time that will artificially inflate the cost of the test. Although the 76% sensitivity achieved in this study is a far cry from the zero percent of , it is likely to get even higher as we continue to analyze the 240 probands of this cohort whose molecular pathophysiology has yet to be determined. Some of the probands in this cohort are likely to have had inflammatory insults to their retinas that mimic Mendelian disease and it is possible that a predisposition to such disease may be detectable in their DNA as our knowledge of the genetics of the immune system continues to expand. There will certainly be additional disease-causing genes identified in the future by subjecting cohorts like this one to more sophisticated analysis or by studying multiplex families who lack mutations in currently known genes. There are also likely to be additional examples of non-exomic 29,33,46 and mitochondrial disease discovered as well as convincing cases of multiple genes interacting with one another to cause disease 47,48. One advantage that we have today over  is the ability to perform many genetic tests recursively, in silico , using inexhaustible data that is stored on servers instead of exhaustible DNA stored in freezers. Another advantage is the ability to derive phenotypically accurate retinal cell cultures from accessible tissues like skin, and to use these cells to test hypotheses that are generated from the DNA analysis 29,40,49. However, the most valuable resources needed to make these new discoveries are unchanged from : relatively large numbers of patients with exceptionally detailed clinical information and large numbers of affected and unaffected family members that can be used to evaluate the many hypotheses that arise when studying the probands. As a result, the astute clinician, who is a good observer and record keeper, and who is willing to do whatever is necessary to find the correct answer and an effective treatment for his or her patient, remains the most valuable component of the entire effort.

The Genes columns provide the number of genes that have been observed to cause the diseases of that clinical group in the published literature and/or at the University of Iowa. The false genotype rate ( FGR ) columns give the percentage of normal individuals that would be expected to harbor a plausible disease-causing complete genotype by chance in any of the genes assigned to each clinical category in the published literature and/or at the University of Iowa. PV is the average number of plausible disease-causing variants one would expect to observe in a normal individual by chance in any of the genes assigned to each clinical category in the published literature. The bar lengths represent the percent of solved cases for each clinical category while the alternating shades represent the proportional contributions of each gene in descending order. Gene names are given for any genes that cause at least 15% of the disease in a given category. Blue bars indicate categories with an FGR less than 5% while grey bars indicate categories with an FGR greater than or equal to 5%.

Statistical cost The false genotype rate (FGR) is the average number of complete genotypes one would expect to observe by chance in a healthy individual in a specified genomic space, based on data from 60,000 normal individuals 23. The probands in this study are shown ordered according to the FGR associated with their clinical category (see Figure 1). The red line indicates the FGR associated with the genes observed to cause disease in this cohort (see also Supplemental Figure 2). The dashed line indicates an FGR of 5% (i.e., the threshold at which one in 20 people would be expected to harbor a plausibly pathogenic, complete genotype by chance). The black bars at the bottom of the  indicate that a diseasecausing genotype was identified in this proband. Assessing the coding sequences of all 301 non-mitochondrial genes in all probands ( green line ) would result in an average FGR of 128% (i.e., these probands would be expected to harbor an average of 1.28 plausible, complete genotypes by chance).

Retinal gene therapy in RPE-65 gene mediated inherited retinal Assad Jalil1, Tsveta Ivanova1, George Moussa1, Neil R. A. Parry1,2and Graeme C. M. Black1  The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists  BACKGROUND: Voretigene neparvovec (VN) is a gene therapeutic agent for treatment of retinal dystrophies caused by bi-allelic RPE65 mutations. We illustrate, both the bene fits and pitfalls associated with ocular gene therapy in the same patient. METHODS: Two eyes of one patient with bi-allelic RPE65 mutations have been treated with VN. The clinical examinations included visual acuity (VA, in normal and low luminance), colour vision, contrast sensitivity, International Society for ClinicalElectrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard retinal electrophysiology and dark-adapted full- field stimulus threshold (FST), Goldmann VF analysis and imaging studies, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and auto fluorescence. These were performed at baseline, 2-weeks, 3 and 6-months, 1 and 2-years follow-up. RESULTS: Thefirst eye showed improvement in rod photoreceptor function with increased peripheral and low luminance vision (baseline VA: 0.9 logMAR and 2-years post-operative VA: 0.7 logMAR). The second eye, whilst showing increased light sensitivity, suffered a drop in central vision (at 2-weeks) with loss of foveal photoreceptors as shown by the loss of ellipsoid zone on OCT scan(baseline VA: 0.6, 2-year post-operative VA: 1.2). FST improvements were maintained in both eyes indicating a sustained ef ficacy of VN with little waning of its effect. CONCLUSIONS: We present a previously unreported adverse complication of subretinal VN therapy in bi-allelic RPE65, indicating a probable immune response in treatment of the second eye, resulting in loss of foveal photoreceptors. This case-series highlightsthe potential and pitfalls of retinal gene therapy in the same patient. The immune responses of the body to a foreign vector , remains a challenge. Eye  37:18741877;  Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) are a group of rare conditions characterised by severe vision loss that result from pathogenic variation in any one of more than 220 different genes [ 1]. One such gene is RPE65 which encodes all-trans retinyl ester isomerase, an enzyme critical to the visual cycle. Biallelic pathogenic variants inRPE65 cause a spectrum of severe rod-mediated IRDs, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) type 2 and retinitis pigmentosa(RP) type 20 [ 2]. Commonly, patients experience nyctalopia from early childhood, and progressive loss of visual field (VF) and visual acuity (VA). LCA type 2 is more severe, patients presenting in infancy with absent fixation, nystagmus, nyctalopia and progressive severe visual loss [ 3]. RP type 20 is variable, usually starting later in childhood with peripheral visual loss that eventually progresses to involve central vision. Over time, all patients withRPE65 mutation-induced IRD have severe loss of light perceptionat any intensity along with profound reduction in navigational vision [ 4]. The role of gene augmentation therapy in RPE65 mediated disease was studied in two open-label phase one studies, and onerandomised controlled phase three trial [ 57]. Overall, the trials reported a consistent improvement in navigational vision, light sensitivity and visual fields. Consequently, the treatment of IRDsreached an in flection point in December , when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Voretigene Neparvovec (VN, Luxturna , Spark Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA) for patients with IRD caused by biallelic RPE65 mutation, the first ever FDAapproved gene therapy. VN treatment is now offered worldwide inselected ocular gene therapy centres. The real-world data that are being gathers increase our understanding of the vast potential of gene therapy whilst highlighting the associated risks in somecases. The case presented here illustrates both the bene fits and pitfalls associated with ocular gene therapy in the same patient. Following a search on our genetic database, a 39-year-old Caucasian male with a pathogenic biallelic RPE65 mutation (Fig. 1) was identi fied and invited for a clinic visit to discuss the new treatment option of VN. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination was carried out and patient underwent a battery of base line investigations. Other than IRD, he had noocular or medical history to note. At baseline the patient s VA (under normal and low luminance), colour vision, and contrast sensitivity were tested using natural pupils. He Received: 11 August  Revised: 13 August  Accepted: 12 September  Published online: 26 September 20221Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.2Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.email:  International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standard retinal electrophysiology and dark-adapted full- field stimulus threshold (FST), Goldmann VF analysis and imaging studies, includingoptical coherence tomography (OCT) and auto fluorescence. There are three criteria to be met for the patient to be considered for VN treatment in the United Kingdom: [ 8] 1. Presence of viable retina (At least 100 microns central retinal thickness on OCT scan) 2. Three or more optic disc areas without atrophy or pigmentary 3. A remaining VF within 30 of fixation. The patient met all the criteria and was offered treatment. After a detailed discussion of all the risks and bene fits of VN, the patient wished to proceed, and informed consent was taken. It was decided to treat his lefteyefirst, which had the worse VA and VF. Three days prior to administration of the gene therapy, the patient was started on oral steroids as per the protocol (prednisone at one mg/kg/day,maximum of 40 mg/day for a total of 7 days, starting 3 days beforeadministration of Voretigene Neparvovec, followed by a tapering dose for10 days) [ 7]. The surgery consisted of 25 G pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), subretinal injection of 0.3 ml of VN, fluid air exchange and closure of all surgical ports with 8/0 vicryl. There were no complications during theprocedure. Following the operation, the patient was advised to maintainsupine position for 24 h and was prescribed topical prednisolone 1% fourtimes daily for 4 weeks; topical cyclopentolate 1% twice daily for 2 weeksand topical chloramphenicol 0.5% four times daily for 2 weeks (standardpractise following PPV). At baseline, we report, logMAR VA was 0.6 (right) and 0.9 (left). Under low photopic illumination, VA was 1.2 (right) and 1.46 (left),and he could not see the chart under mesopic illumination. Ganzfeld electroretinograms (ERGs) were extinguished in both eyes; multifocal ERGs did not show any recordable signal from any location in the central 60. FST mean thresholds were 2.32 dB for the right and 2.29 dB for the left eye respectively. OCT and VF were also carried out to determine patient eligibility. Early in the postoperative period, the patient started noticing increased light sensitivity and improved low luminance navigation. Two weeks following surgery, he developed left-sided cystoidmacular oedema (Fig. 2), which showed little improvement with steroid eye drops but settled completely on a short 2-week course of oral steroids. VA remained at 0.8 for the left eye a month after surgery. After careful consideration, with the patient reportingmarked improvement in light sensitivity and low luminance vision, it was decided to proceed with the surgery of the second eye. The procedure of the right eye was uneventful with no complicationsand was covered with a 17-day course of perioperative oralsteroids as before. In the early postoperative period following the second surgery, the patient again noted a signi ficant improvement in low luminance and navigational vision. However, at 2 weeks post-surgery, he reported a sharp decrease in central vision. At this point, VA of the right eye had dropped from 0.6 preoperatively to hand movements. OCT showed signi ficant cystoid macular oedema, worse than in the left eye. Oral prednisolone, which would have been stopped at 2 weeks post-surgery, was increased to 40 mg and continued on a tapering dose for another 4 weeks. The macular oedema of the right eye completely resolved by6 weeks after surgery and the VA, although showing some improvement, remained considerably lower at 1.2 compared to preoperative levels of 0.6. By now, OCT showed complete loss ofthe ellipsoid zone (EZ) localised to the fovea, and not the entiresurgical bleb size (Fig. 3). EZ is linked to photoreceptor layer integrity and is a marker of central visual function. Foveal EZ loss is a previously unreported adverse effect of gene therapy. At the 3-month follow-up after the second eye s surgery, the patient underwent further tests. Low luminance VA showed Fig. 1 Fundus picture of the patient. Retinal vascular attenuation and pigmentary changes with bone spicule-like pigment deposition. Pre-surgery Two-weeks post-surgery Three-months post-surgery Six-months post-surgery Fig. 2 OCT of the left eye. Marked cystoid macular oedema at 2 weeks which settled with oral steroids, and no change in thecentral ellipsoid zone as shown by subsequent scans. Pre-surgery Two-weeks post-surgery Three-months post-surgery Six-months post-surgery Fig. 3 OCT of the right eye. Marked cystoid macular oedema at 2 weeks which settled with oral steroids, but resulted in permanentloss of central ellipsoid zone as shown by subsequent scans. A.  Eye  37:1874  1877signi ficant improvement in the left eye of 0.2 log units at 85 cd m2 and by 0.45 at 5.4 cd m2. Furthermore, the patient could now see the mesopic (0.35 cd m2) chart, with VA of 1.32. The right eye, as expected, showed reduced central acuity. FST showed marked improvement in scotopic sensitivity, by a factor of 10 (one log unit) in the right eye and by a factor of 16 (1.2 log unit) in the lefteye (Fig. 2). Hence there was improvement in rod photoreceptormediated retinal sensitivity in both eyes, with improvement of VA in the left eye as well, but reduction in central vision in the right eye due to loss of foveal photoreceptors. Further follow up at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years showed stable vision of 1.2 logMAR in the right and 0.7 logMAR in the left eye. FST improvements were maintained in both eyes indicating a sustained ef ficacy of VN with little waning of its effect (Fig. 4). In , Theodore Friedman and Richard Roblin laid thefoundation of gene therapy in their ground-breaking article in the journal Science, writing: In our view, gene therapy may ameliorate some human genetic diseases in the future . There was slow progress in this field until , when interest in gene therapy suddenly exploded, with US FDA approving three gene therapy products including VN, the first approved gene therapy treatment for patients with IRD caused by biallelic RPE65mutation. VN, being a subretinal gene therapy requires a surgical procedure (vitrectomy) and subretinal injection for administration. Safety and ef ficacy of VN and its route of administration have been studied in 40 patients in the phase 1 follow-on and phase 3 studies [ 10]. The safety pro file of the drug was considered to be consistent with vitrectomy and the subretinal injection procedure. Twenty-seven patients (68%) had ocular treatment-emergentadverse events, mostly mild. Two serious ocular adverse events occurred resulting in irreversible visual loss, both attributable to the surgical procedure: one patient had macular atrophy and theother developed endophthalmitis and increased intraocularpressure leading to optic atrophy. Three patients (7.5%) had ocular in flammation which settled without any sequelae. There were no drug-related serious adverse events or severe immuneresponses. Since the original trials, the real-world data on the ef ficacy and safety of VN is gradually trickling in ref. [ 11], and a postauthorisation multi-centre study, PERCEIVE, collecting safety datafor 5 years after treatment with VN, is currently underway. In this backdrop, we present our unique case which shows the success and risks of retinal gene therapy in the same patient. Thefirst eye of our patient shows an excellent outcome in all visual parameters following treatment with VN. IRD due to RPE65 mutation is rod-mediated, so VA is not a true marker of diseaseprogression. FST is a sensitive global measure of dark-adaptedsensitivity to light and hence photoreceptor function. In addition, it correlates well with navigation under dim illumination [ 10]. There was a signi ficant improvement in FST in the left eye in our patient by a factor of 16, which corresponded with the subjectiveimprovement noted by the patient and was also re flected in lowluminance VA gains. Furthermore, photopic VA, which is a foveal cone-mediated function, improved by 0.2 logMAR units. This maybe a secondary consequence of improved cone health due to RPE65 gene augmentation. OCT revealed mild in flammatory macular oedema 2 weeks after surgery; this spared the photo-receptor layer. This could have been a postoperative in flammatory response to the surgery, which normally develops later. As subsequent events showed, it is more likely that this was an immune response to the drug. This is in contrast to the type-1 cell-mediated effector immunity response that has been previouslyimplicated with subretinal gene therapy in murine eyes [ 12], Either way, a temporary increase in oral steroids immediately settled the macular oedema and the photoreceptor layer at the fovearemained unaffected. The improvement in visual function in this eye was sustained at 2 years of follow-up, an outcome clearly indicating the vast potential of gene therapy in IRD. Whilst progress was initially similar, the second eye followed a different trajectory. The patient noticed improvement in light sensitivity, which was picked up by the FST, but at 2 weeks postsurgery noticed a signi ficant fall in VA. There was marked macular oedema coming up to the EZ, showing the involvement ofphotoreceptors. The macular oedema responded to an immediate increase in oral steroids, but by the time the retinal layers settled, there was loss of foveal photoreceptors. The fact that the macular oedema was worse in the second eye indicates previous immunesensitisation, and it was steroid-responsive, both factors pointing to an immune-mediated aetiology. This resulted in loss of central foveal function. Such a complication of VN treatment has not beenreported before. Although mechanical damage to the other segment resulting from surgical retinal detachment is well recognised [ 13], this is typically time dependent [ 14] and unlikely to cause the structural changes observed on the OCT after such a0 100 200 300 400 500 600 7000.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0R Day0 100 200 300 400 500 600 7001.81.61.41.21.00.80.60.4 85R 5.4R 5.4L 0.35R 0.35LLogMAR Day0 100 200 300 400 500 600 7000-2-4-6-8-10-12-14-16-18R LThreshold (dB) Fig. 4 Baseline and post-surgical measures of visual function.

Additionally, the loss of ellipsoid zone was localised to the fovea, rather than the whole retina that was detached in the surgical bleb. Severe immune responses have always been a danger with retinal gene therapy and thus the original trials used a perioperative immunomodulatory regimen. The vector was optimised to remove the empty capsids from the final product . The surgical technique which we used was completely according to protocol and had innovations to reduce the risk of vector-related adverse events. VN was administered subretinally through a single 41-gauge retinotomy to reduce the egress of thedrug into the vitreous cavity, a further vitrectomy was done afterdrug administration to remove escaped capsids, and all vitreous fluid was removed at the end by carrying out a fluid-air exchange. Despite all this, loss of foveal photoreceptors due to a presumedimmune response was detected. One option in such cases may be the use of increased immunomodulation for the second eye by a higher and more prolonged course of oral steroids if aninflammatory response is seen in the first eye. Our case is unique in that it highlights the potential and pitfalls of retinal gene therapy in the same patient. The future is promising but challenges remain, especially the immuneresponses of the body to a foreign vector . As further evidence comes in and more gene-based therapies become available, we willfind better and safer ways to deliver gene therapy, whilst minimising the associated risks, in our pursuit of finding the ultimate cure for hereditary diseases. Immune response to the body as a foreign vector ,i sa signi ficant challenge in gene therapy. Voretigene neparvovec (VN) is a gene therapeutic agent for treatment of retinal dystrophies caused by bi-allelic RPE65 mutations. We present a previously unreported adverse complication of subretinal VN therapy in bi-allelic RPE65, indicating a probable immune response in treatment of the second eye, resulting inloss of foveal photoreceptors. This case highlights the bene fit and pitfalls of retinal gene therapy in the same patient. The raw data are available upon reasonable request. 1. RetNet.

Methods: Single-centre retrospective analysis of patients with diagnosed or suspected IRD. Results:Fourhundredandsixty-fourpatientrecordswereanalysed.PatientshadreceivedcarefordifferentIRDsgroupedasfollows: panretinal pigmentary retinopathies (283, 61%), macular dystrophies (136, 29.3%), stationary diseases (23, 5%), hereditary vitreoretinopathies (14, 3%), and other IRDs (8, 1.7%). The suspected pattern of inheritance of patients IRD was predominantly autosomal recessive (205, 44.2%). Genetic testing was performed with the corresponding results available for 44 patients (9.5%). Diagnostic yieldwas65.9%fortheresultsreceived. Genetictestresultswereavailablemostlyforyoungerpatients(13.1%for10%),35Spain(11%),22andIran(76%).30AstudybyKhanetalfoundthatdiagnosticyieldincreased from45%to60%whenconsanguinitywasconsideredtoselectthemostappropriatetest.36Thisresultsupportstheimportanceof capturingpatientsethnicbackgroundandpedigreestructuretoincreasedetectionratesofthedisease-causingvariant.36 Inthecurrentstudycohort,thepredominantinheritancepatternwasautosomalrecessive(44.2%)followedbyautosomal dominant(12.9%)andX-linkedinheritance(4.7%).AstudybyLiuetalsimilarlyreportedthatinaregistrycontaining 800 Chinese families, the inheritance pattern was also predominantly autosomal recessive (43.88%), followed by X-linked (9.25%)andautosomaldominant(7%).34StudiesintheUK20,29,36andtheUS14alsoreportsimilarfrequenciesofinheritance patterns. However,astudybyCoco-Martinetalreportedthatthemostcommoninheritancepatternbasedonfamily historyintheircohortofIRDpatientswasautosomaldominant(52%)followedbyautosomalrecessive(23%)andX-linked (10%) inheritance.22This may be attributed to a greater proportion of macular dystrophies in their study (n=161), mainly following an autosomal dominant inheritance, compared to panretinal pigmentary retinopathies (n=39) following an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.22This variation in IRD phenotype may further be explained by the extensive macular dystrophiesreportedintheSpanishcohort,22potentiallyasaresultofgeographicdisparitiesandgreaterfrequenciesofcertain mutationsincommonracialclassifications(Africa,Europe,Asia,Oceania,Americas).37 Aproportionofourcohorthadinconclusiveresults,whichincludedbothnegative(31.8%)resultsfromgenetictestreportsand unavailable or pending (22.4%) results from tests ordered. Our solve rate was 65.9% for those patients who had genetic testing, which is comparable to diagnostic yield reported by studies in the US (76%),14China (60%),34and New Zealand (83.6%).33Mottaetalreportedresultssimilartothecurrentstudy,with71.6%oftheircohortreceivingaconclusive moleculardiagnosiscomparedto28%individualsreceivingnegativeorinconclusiveresults.35Ourresultsweresignificantly greater than the solution rate reported in Norway (32%).31Gene-panel testing for IRD was not available at the time of that publication(priorto2016)inNorway;therefore,arrayedprimerextensionwasthetestofchoicewhichinvolvestestingeach patientforapanelofknowndisease-causinggenes.31NGStestingincreasesdiagnosticyield;however,itmayalsoincrease detectionofvariantofunknownsignificance(VUS).Therefore,furtherinvestigationisrequiredinthisarea.11,38 The diagnostic yield for genetic testing also varies depending on the provisional IRD diagnosis, testing methodology and whether the IRD is genetically simple or exhibits complex disease phenotypes.38,39Jiman et al  reported a significant improvement in genetic diagnosis for people with a provisional clinical diagnosis compared to individuals without a clinical diagnosis at the time of genetic testing (71% compared to 25%).39Furthermore, Li et al  suggestedthattailoringthepanelofgenestotheclinicalpresentationincreasesthediagnosticyieldofgenetictestingand reducesthefalse-positiverateofVUS.40Incorporationofclinicaldiagnosesintogenetictestingmustbeconsideredalong with genetic testing methods and gene panel selection. Among the patients who did not have genetic testing results available, 8.4% of clinical records documented patient refusal; however, this  may be higher since approximately 70% of clinical records did not have documented counselling regarding genetic testing. It is important to consider the clinical context of genetic testing. At the time of care, genetic testing was often clinically unjustified in many of our patients with an established IRD diagnosis, stable clinical phenotype, or beyond reproductive age. Patient visits with the sole intention of providing legal blindness certification to established IRD patients or performing single procedure services such as electroretinography were considered exempt from genetic testing counselling and ordering. DovePressClinical Ophthalmology :16 1134Gocuk et al Dovepress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Patient-related barriers to uptake of genetic testing have been explored in several studies. Li et al  found that patients were reluctant to agree to genetic testing due to cost involved, advanced age, mobility challenges due to poor vision and difficulty arranging transportation among the visually impaired.40However, 73% of the eligible patients consenttogenetictestingwhenatnocosttothem.40Recentlyannouncedindustrysponsoredtestingprograms(including Invitae and the Blueprint/Novartis collaboration, both commencing in ) offer IRD patients free access to panel testing in Australia, which may overcome this barrier. However, whether clinicians are aware of such programs remains unknown. Previous studies also recognise patients education, family status and age affect acceptance of genetic testing.23,41,42The main reasons for negative attitudes were due to the assumption that abortion rates will increase, exposuretosocialdiscrimination,misuseofresultsbyorderingclinician,andanxietiessurroundingtheirownhealthand thatoftheirchilds.23,42Therefore,thereisaroleforclinicianstoearntheirpatientstrustandprovideinformativeadvice regarding the advantages of genetic testing. Inaddition,Neiweemetalrecognisedthatmanycliniciansinmedicineandophthalmologyareunfamiliarwith genetic testing due to the several complexities involved.43Clinicians may be unaware which patients are suitable candidates, the appropriate test to order, how to interpret results, or the associated cost of genetic testing.21,43Further education may be required to educate clinicians and patients regarding the benefits of genetic testing using informative resources such as the Retina International Campaign, Know Your Code ( www.kyc.retinaint.org ).44Confoundingly, there is also variation in testing guidelines between international and Australian guidelines, with international patient advocacy groups such as Retina International detailing a need for global consensus in published guidelines.44The RANZCO have recently published comprehensive IRD management guidelines, which emphasise the importance of genetic testing in accordance with clinical benefits.11With emerging gene-dependent treatment options such as gene therapy, it is important to screen IRD patients to facilitate appropriate referral for clinical trials efficiently when it becomesavailable. Ofnote,inunsolvedcases,thecurrentliteraturerecommendsaretestintervalofatleast18months.45 Previously reported resource-related barriers to genetic testing include long turnaround times of genetic testing (up to 6 monthsinsomecases),46limitationsofgenetictestingmethods,39andlimitedintegrationofdifferentmedicalspecialitiessuch asophthalmologyandgeneticcounsellors.21ThelatterchallengeisbeingaddressedinAustralia,andothercountries,through multi-disciplinaryclinicssuchastheOcularGeneticsClinicattheRoyalVictorianEyeandEarHospital.

Akeystrengthofourstudyistherelativelylargepatientcohort,consistingof464patientsfromasinglelargetertiary ophthalmic practice. Furthermore, the study constituted a rigorous process of selecting appropriate patients using a twostage clinical record review by the senior author (HM), followed by an ophthalmology registrar (YJ) and an optometrist experienced in IRD (SG) to assess clinical diagnoses and genetic testing results. Study limitations include the large heterogeneity in patient follow-up duration, ranging from single visits to regular patients attending for up to 27 years. The relatively high number of single visits at this clinic is due to high numbers of referrals solely for electrophysiological testing, diagnosing patients and/or certifying legal blindness. Once patients receive their clinical diagnosis, they return to their primary eyecare provider for ongoing management, who may have ordered genetic testing however forwarded these results with patient referrals. Furthermore, the relatively high not further specified reason for lack of genetic testing may be indicative of the variation of clinicians clinical record documentation patterns that did not capture discussions, referrals, and/or patient opinions. For pathogenicity determination, we relied on information provided by the laboratory and/or geneticist or genetic counsellor available in patients clinical records. In some cases, the letter provided to the ophthalmologist contained only information on the name of the affected gene and number of variants identified but no information on the specific variants. In the future, we expect these  to improve with availability of higher precision genetic testing methods, free sponsored programs, FDA-approved gene therapy, and potentially greater awareness of genetic testing benefits. We aim to repeat this study in 2 years, to assess the impact these policy and practice changes have on genetic test ordering for people with IRD. Future research should evaluate genetic testing in the public system, as well as additional barriers, policies, and patient perceptions of the genetic testing process in Australia.

manuscript; available in PMC  April 28. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptESCS ESCS ( NR2E3 , OMIM 268100) is a rare slowly progressive AR form of retinal degeneration, typically characterised by nummular pigment clumping at the level of the RPE, often most plentiful around the temporal vascular arcades (Figure 5D) ( 135). OCT studies may show a disturbed perimacular region (thought to be filled with S-cone photoreceptors instead of rods), with thick and bulging retina and abnormal laminar architecture (Figure 5D) ( 136). Other imaging findings include: torpedo-like changes, deep atrophic lesions with a small hyperpigmented rim, helicoid subretinal fibrosis, circumferential fibrotic scars in the posterior pole with a spared centre, large fibrotic scars around the optic nerve head, and yellow-white dots in areas of relatively normal-appearing retina ( 137,138). BCD ( CYP4V2 , OMIM 608614) is an AR disease, with similar clinical symptoms to RP, associated with progressive RPE-choriocapillaris complex atrophy and retinal crystals (Figure 5E), which can disappear with disease progression, resulting in greater RPE disruption ( 139,140). FAF shows sharply demarcated areas of RPE loss that coincide with abrupt edges of outer retinal atrophy on OCT; with the crystals generally situated on or in, the RPE/Bruchs complex ( 139). Rod Dysfunction syndromes are a genetically diverse group of non-progressive primary dysfunctions of the rod system, most commonly causing congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) - with [Fundus Albipunctatus (FA) and Oguchi Disease] or without abnormal fundi (complete and incomplete CSNB) ( 141). Complete and Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (cCSNB/iCSNB) In contrast to FA and Oguchi disease, which are described below, cCSNB/iCSNB have no distinctive fundus appearance with normal or myopic fundi ( 142). Electrophysiological findings are the key to differentiate cCSNB and iCSNB; complete dysfunction of onpathway and incomplete dysfunction of both on- and off-pathways ( 143). cCSNB/iCSNB have a heterogeneous genetic background including AD, AR and X-linked, with variable V A and night blindness ( 141). Aland Eye Disease is a form of X-linked incomplete CSNB, due to variants in CACNA1F , with common features of nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia visible on OCT, and subnormal V A ( 144,145). OCT in 3 patients with GRM6 variants (AR CSNB) identified selective thinning of the inner retinal layers suggesting either reduced bipolar or ganglion cell numbers or altered synaptic structure in the inner retina ( 146). FA is an AR disease characterized by multiple white subretinal spots ( 147), throughout the retina (Figure 6A). FA has been attributed to variants in RDH5 , RLBP1 and RPE65 (148). RDH5 retinopathy (also RPE65 and RLBP1 , albeit to a lesser extent) leads to reduced AF signal possibly because of absence of retinoid-derived fluorophores ( 147). The white dots in younger subjects appear as foci of increased signal on FAF imaging (Figure 6A).  Page 10 Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC  April 28. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptimaging the associated deposits extend from Bruchs membrane to the external limiting membrane, with a focal loss of photoreceptor outer segments ( 147). Development of macular atrophy/cone dysfunction can be observed in a later stage of the disease ( 149151). Oguchi ( SAG , GRK1) disease is a rare form of AR CSNB having the distinguishing feature of the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon: diffuse green-golden fundus discolouration in the presence of light (Figure 6B) which returns to normal after prolonged dark adaption (141,152) Foveal retinal thickness can be normal on OCT (Figure 6B) ( 146). AOSLO identified that rods, but not cones, change intensity after dark adaptation, suggesting that the fundus changes are the result of changes within the rods as opposed to changes at a different retinal locus ( 146). Development of peripheral atrophy is observed in a later stage of the disease ( 153). Choroideremia (CHM) CHM ( CHM , OMIM 300390) is a rare X-linked condition characterized by degeneration of the choriocapillaris, RPE and retina (Figure 7A), with males presenting in early adulthood or late childhood with nyctalopia and constricted peripheral vision ( 154). The skewed Xinactivation can lead to symptomatic female carriers (Figure 7B), sharing similar imaging characteristics to affected males. FAF of the disease allows direct visualization of the choroidal vessels due to loss of the photoreceptor layers and the RPE, with a residual asymmetric central area of functioning retina. Common OCT findings include IZ attenuation, with or without intact EZ, outer retinal tubulations, interlaminar bridges and RPE thinning ( 155157). AOSLO has been employed extensively, demonstrating a normal photoreceptor mosaic in asymptomatic carriers and patchy cone loss in symptomatic carriers ( 155). Affected males have disrupted parafoveal mosaics, with increased cone spacing. The cone spacing is more regular near the borders of atrophy ( 155). The largest multimodal study to date including the use of AOSLO ( 156), describes a relatively intact central retina with a normal or reduced cone density at 0.5 mm eccentricity; and an abrupt loss of cones at the border of RPE atrophy, as well as hyperreflective clumps of cones in younger patients (<30 years) and bubble-like lesions within the choroid ( 157). IZ drop-out precedes EZ disruption and no RPE cells were visible in areas of cone loss ( 156). Investigators thereby proposed that CHM is primarily an RPE disorder followed by photoreceptor degeneration; recent OCTA studies have similar conclusions. A phase II/III gene therapy trial is on-going. Gyrate atrophy (GA) GA ( OAT , OMIM 613349) is a rare in-born error of metabolism with retinal manifestations of progressive chorioretinal loss, beginning as small areas of peripheral RPE and choroidal atrophy, which coalesce to larger well demarcated atrophic area, visible on FAF as area of decreased AF (Figure 7C) ( 158). On OCT macular oedema can be seen, as well as retinal tubulations in advanced disease ( 158,159). Page 11 Ann Eye Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC  April 28. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptConcluding remarks & future prospects Advances in molecular genetic techniques have greatly simplified molecular diagnosis. Similarly, advances in retinal imaging and retinal function testing have improved knowledge of disease natural history, which is key to identifying treatment effects in clinical trials of novel therapies. The remaining challenge is to develop novel therapies that will slow degeneration or improve function. The ongoing and upcoming trials emphasise the increasing need for further detailed investigation of retinal structure, to better explore the natural history of the diseases, the reliability and repeatability of the different imaging methods and measurements, and moreover define inclusion criteria, prognostic indicators and endpoints.

as agerelated diseases13,11,14,12. Non-coding variants, both in cis and trans , can exert strong in  uence on DNAm, alter chromatin topology, and modulate the expression of target genes15,16,17,18. Integrated analyses of genetic variants affecting DNAm (mQTLs), association between DNAm sites and gene expression (eQTMs), and GWAS of complex traits have only recently begun to elucidate the complex relationshipsPage 4/40among multiple disease-causing factors19,20,21. However, no such information currently exists for eye or retinal tissues and traits. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by loss of central vision and is the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment and blindness in older individuals worldwide22. Patients with AMD exhibit lipid-rich extracellular deposits (drusen), atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and loss of photoreceptors primarily in the central macular region of the retina. Advanced age is arguably a major critical component in addition to genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (such as smoking and diet), which together determine etiology and varying phenotypes of AMD22. A large AMD GWAS had previously identi  ed association of 52 independent genetic variants at 34 loci23, which have been expanded to 46 loci in a larger GWAS metaanalysis24 and 63 loci by a cross-ancestry GWAS25. Causal genes and functionally relevant variants at most AMD-associated loci are still unrecognized, though a few key biological pathways have begun to emerge26. Ultra-rare variants in case-control or family-based genetic studies can potentially point to causal genes23,27, as exempli  ed by the identi  cation of complement 8A and C8B28. Furthermore, like other complex traits, the majority of AMD-associated variants are present in non-coding regions that could regulate expression and epigenetic landscape of distal genes. Integrated statistical analyses of GWAS with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in retina and GTEx tissues have helped in prioritizing potential target genes for AMD2932. Recent high-resolution mapping of human retinal genome topology further helps elucidate chromatin looping patterns of variants in distal cis-regulatory elements, such as enhancers, and re  nes candidate disease-causing genes33. Despite innovative advances, we have limited understanding of underlying mechanisms that associate genetic regulation with epigenomic shifts linked to aging and environmental factors in AMD pathogenesis. QTL mapping of DNAm and its integration with GWAS and eQTLs in the human retina can potentially uncover epigenomic regulation of disease pathogenesis, as demonstrated for multiple other tissues20,21,34. We note that alterations in DNAm are also associated with aging in the retina35,36. Here, we generated genome-wide DNAm pro  les of 160 human retina samples to identify associations between genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional variation relevant to retinal homeostasis and complex disease traits, such as AMD. We report mapping of mQTLs and eQTMs and an integrative analysis of mQTLs, eQTLs and AMD-GWAS variants. Using Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), multiple colocalization methods, and Hi-C data, we demonstrate complex associations among genetic variants, DNAm, and gene expression and identify 87 unique genes affected by DNAm that may contribute to AMD risk. Our studies provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying epigenomic regulation of AMD and suggest aging and environment-responsive pathways. Overview of the analysis work  owPage 5/40We designed an integrative analysis work  ow of multiple human retina omics datasets, incorporating DNAm, gene expression, imputed genotypes, AMD-GWAS, and Hi-C data (Fig. 1a). We carried out DNAm pro ling of postmortem retinas (n = 160), with an equal distribution of males and females and mean age of 73 years, using the Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Supplementary Table 1). After quality control (QC) and covariate analysis (see Methods) (Extended Data Fig. 1a-d), DNAm data from 152 retina samples was integrated with the previously published corresponding genotype and expression data29,31 for cis-mQTL mapping. We also performed concurrent cis-eQTL analysis from 403 retinas with genotype and RNA-seq data from the same study29 correcting for covariates (see Methods). In addition, associations were tested between DNAm of CpG sites and gene expression ( cis-eQTMs) using all 152 retina samples with methylation data, RNA-seq and covariates. To test for causal relationships between cis-mQTLs and cis-eQTLs, and between m/eQTLs and AMD GWAS signals, we pursued two approaches: (i) SMR to distinguish pleiotropic or causal association from linkage of genetic associations with DNAm, gene expression and AMD37,19,38, and (ii) colocalization analyses that test whether co-occurring association signals are tagging the same causal variant/haplotype, including eCAVIAR39, coloc40, and multiple-trait-coloc (moloc)41. We also integrated adult retina Hi-C data including chromatin loops, and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and super-enhancers (SEs)33 inferred from chromatin histone marks with mQTLs, eQTLs, eQTMs, and SMR or moloc associations, to identify high con  dence candidate AMD and QTL target genes through physical linking between variants, CpG sites and genes. To characterize genetic regulation of DNAm in human retina, we performed cis-mQTL (n = 152) analysis on all genotyped and imputed variants in cis ( 1 Mb) of 749,158 CpG sites that passed stringent QC criteria (see Methods) using QTLtools42. Controlling for genetic population structure with top 10 genotype principal components (PCs) and for batch and other hidden confounding effects with inferred surrogate variables (SVs), we identi  ed 2,817,314 signi  cant variant-CpG cis-mQTLs (FDR  0.05) for 36,906 CpG sites that map to 10,000 mGenes (Methods, and Supplementary Table 2). We detected 37,453 independent mQTL signals using conditional analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2a), with 98.5% having a single independent signal per CpG (Supplementary Table 2, Extended Data Fig. 2c). Only 564 (1.5%) CpG sites had two independent mQTL signals. Concurrent analysis of all variants within  1 Mb of 17,382 genes expressed in the retina (n = 403, Methods) revealed 2,023,293 signi  cant variant-gene cis-eQTLs (FDR  0.05) for 9,395 eGenes; of these, 12,505 are independent eQTLs (Extended Data Fig. 2b). A large fraction of eGenes (26.8%) showed more than one independent genetic effect in contrast to the CpG sites, though we might detect more independent signals for CpG methylation with a larger sample size (Supplementary Table 3, Extended Data Fig. 2c). Almost 95% of the mQTL variants are clustered near CpGs (median distance of 11.4kb) (Extended Data Fig. 2d), as recently identi  ed for other tissues21, whereas 95% of eQTL variants clustered near the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the corresponding eGene (median distance of 5.5kb) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). A majority of CpGs (including all tested and those with signi  cant mQTLs) are present within 200 bp or 1,500 bp of TSSs, 5 UTR, gene body andPage 6/40intergenic regions. In addition, CpGs with signi  cant mQTLs were relatively depleted from exon boundary and 3 UTR regions when compared to all CpGs (Fig. 1b). Genomic features and biological processes enriched in We examined the enrichment of mQTL variants (FDR  0.05) in functional genomic elements and compared the results to eQTL variants using TORUS43,44 (see Methods). Retina mQTLs were signi  cantly enriched in both coding regions and transcriptional regulatory elements, with the strongest enrichment detected in frameshift variants, followed by open chromatin regions, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, enhancers, synonymous variants, and 3 and 5 UTR (Fig. 1c). Though highly enriched among frameshift variants, this class of mQTLs accounted for only 214 mVariants (Extended Data Fig. 2f, right panel). Synonymous variants, enhancers, and open chromatin regions accounted for the largest number of enriched mQTLs (thousands of mVariants; Extended Data Fig. 2f, right panel). In contrast, eQTLs were strongly enriched among variants that affect splicing, followed by frameshift variants, 5 UTR, TF binding sites, 3 UTR, and regulatory regions (Extended Data Fig. 2f, left panel). Though not signi  cantly enriched in open chromatin regions and enhancers (lower bound 95% con  dence interval  0.05), corresponding to 2,256 eQTLs, 5,612 mQTLs and 1,983 genes (Fig. 3c). In the M2E_SMR analysis, 9,307 associations (SMR P-value  0.05) corresponding to 5,175 mQTLs, 5,012 eQTLs and 2,101 genes (Fig. 3d). Of the 6,592 M2E_SMR associations, 232 associations (3.5%) corresponding to 232 genes were also identi  ed as signi  cant eQTMs. We detected 554 common associations between E2M_SMR and M2E_SMR (Extended Data Fig. 5a), proposing a feedback mechanism between DNAm and gene expression regulation for a minority of the 513 mQTLs (1.3%) and 292 eQTLs (2.3%). A larger number of signi  cant M2E_SMR associations compared to E2M_SMR suggests that the genetic effect of DNAm on gene expression is a more predominant mechanism than the genetic effect of gene expression on DNAm. We further compared the genes identi  ed in both E2M_SMR and M2E_SMR analysis and discerned 1,447 common genes that were common out of 1,983 E2M_SMR and 2,101 M2E_SMR genes. Notably, ten common genes were enriched in the glutathione metabolism pathway (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5b). The E2M_SMR and M2E_SMR shared genes were also enriched in immune related processes (such as antigen processing and presentation and autoimmune diseases) and metabolic processes (such as glycolysis-gluconeogenesis and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450) (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 15). For example, for glutathione S-transferase mu 1, GSTM1 , we detected an association in E2M_SMR with CpG cg24506221 and SNP rs36209093 (SMR P-value  0.05) and another association in M2E_SMR with SNP rs148490733 and CpG cg24506221 (SMR P-value  0.05) (Fig. 3f). This causal relationship was further supported by the eQTM analysis, where the CpG cg24506221 located within 200 bp of the TSS of GSTM1 was negatively correlated with GSTM1 expression levels (Fig. 3g). To provide additional support for a shared causal variant between retina mQTLs and eQTLs that co-occur along the genome, we applied Bayesian colocalization, using coloc40, to all signi  cant eQTL and/or mQTL (EM) variants (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Using a stringent posterior probability of association (PPA)  0.8, we determined a signi  cant colocalization for 9,417 variants and 2,423 genes (Supplementary Table 16). Target genes of the colocalizing EM signals were enriched in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways (FDR  0.05) and are thus likely to be pleiotropic (Fig. 4b). Similarly, we used our retina eQTLs to test for pleiotropic associations between gene expression and AMD GWAS and identi  ed 14 associations at 7 loci (SMR P-value  0.05) (Fig. 4c). In our previously published eQTL study, we identi  ed the same target genes for 4 of the loci, including CFI, PILRB/PILRA, RDH5/CD63 and TMEM97/VTN , based on colocalization analysis29 (Supplementary Table 19). The retina mQTLs and eQTLs proposed the same target genes for one locus PILRB/PILRA , and new causal mechanisms and genes for AMD at 3 (KMT2E/SRPK2 , PILRB/PILRA and ARMS2/HTRA1) and 2 ( C2/CFB/SKIV2L and PILRB/PILRA ) loci, respectively. For example, at the PILRB/PILRA locus, we identi  ed SNP rs11766752 and CpG cg07160278 in uencing both DNAm and AMD (SMR P-value = 2.88x10 7 and HEIDI P-value = 0.09). cg07160278 is localized in the TSS region of MEPCE and ZCWPW1 genes, and for this CpG we identi  ed eQTM with PILRA gene (Fig. 4d). With eQTL and AMD GWAS SMR analysis, we identi  ed SNP rs45451301 at the C2CFB-SKIV2L locus in  uencing both DXO expression and AMD risk (SMR P-value = 2.02x10 7 and HEIDI Pvalue = 0.38) (Fig. 4e). At the CFI locus, SMR detected SNP rs7439493 in  uencing PLA2G12A expression and AMD risk (SMR P-value = 2.6x10 8 and HEIDI P-value = 0.22) (Extended Data Fig. 6a), as identi  ed in our previous eQTL study29.Page 10/40We next used the Bayesian colocalization method eCAVIAR39 to test whether retina mQTLs and eQTLs share one or more causal variants with known AMD GWAS loci. Signi  cant colocalization would prioritize potential causal mQTLs/eQTLs and target CpGs or genes for AMD. Of 52 independent AMD GWAS variants at 34 loci, we identi  ed signi  cant colocalization (Colocalization posterior probability, CLPP > 0.01) of one or more mQTLs and/or eQTLs with 17 AMD GWAS variants in 10 loci (29.4% of loci) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). An average of 1.87  0.52 causal genes per locus were proposed based on mQTLs, 1.4  0.24 based on eQTLs, and 2.1  0.50 causal genes based on mQTLs and/or eQTLs (Supplementary Table 20). A single causal gene was proposed for 5 (14.7%) of the loci (Supplementary Table 20). Fifteen AMD GWAS variants in 8 (23.5%) loci colocalized with at least one retina mQTLs, and 6 AMD GWAS variants in 5 loci (14.7% of loci) colocalized with at least one retina eQTL (Supplementary Table 20). Only mQTLs colocalized with an AMD signal at 5 loci, with CFH as a target gene at the CFH locus (Extended Data Fig. 6c and 6d), a lincRNA LINC01004 at the KMT2E/SRPK2 locus (Fig. 4f and 4g), ARHGAP21 and RNA5SP305 at the ARHGAP2 locus, RAD51B at the RAD51B locus, and MARK4 at the APOE (EXOC3L2 /MARK4 ) locus. Two loci had only eQTLs colocalizing with the AMD signal, with SARM1 and TMEM199 target genes at the TMEM97/VTN locus and TMEM259 at the CNN2 locus. At the AMD locus rs147859257/rs2230199 on chromosome 19, both a mQTL (cg12024887 and cg07567260 that mapped to GRP108 , MIR6791 and TRIP10 ) and an eQTL (acting on GRP108 ) colocalized with the AMD association signal, suggesting that the causal effect of the colocalizing mQTL in this AMD locus may be acting via altered GRP108 expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e, 6f and 6g ). Eighteen of the colocalizing genes have not yet been identi  ed as targets at corresponding AMD loci. The mQTL of CpG cg11712338 mapped to LINC01004 and colocalized with AMD at the KMT2E/SRPK2 locus (Fig. 4f). SMR analysis further validated this gene as a high con  dence new AMD gene. Colocalization analysis of retina mQTLs, eQTLs and GWAS identi  es additional AMD genes To determine shared causal variants between retina mQTLs or eQTLs and AMD and identify novel AMD genes, we applied the colocalization method coloc40 to the following pairwise comparisons: AMD GWAS and mQTL (GM), AMD GWAS and eQTL (GE), and mQTL and eQTL (EM) (described above), considering all signi  cant mQTLs/eQTLs genome-wide (Fig. 5a and Methods). We discovered signi  cant GM colocalization results for 69 mVariants and 81 CpG sites corresponding to 58 genes (PPA  0.8) at 11 AMD loci (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 21) and signi  cant GE colocalization for 44 eVariants and 32 genes at 3 AMD loci (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 22). Three colocalizing variants at 3 AMD loci were signi  cant with both GM and GE (Supplementary Table 23). The genes identi  ed in GM and GE were enriched (FDR  0.05) in immune-related processes, such as antigen processing and presentation (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The GM and GE signi  cant colocalizations detected 42 and 47 new AMD associations, respectively. Considering these new AMD associations, we identi  ed 36 mVariants and 43 CpG sites corresponding to 30 genes in GM and 29 eVariants and 24 genes in GE (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22).Page 11/40To further identify variants associated with DNAm, gene expression and AMD, we applied the multi-trait colocalization method, moloc41, across AMD GWAS, eQTL and mQTL (GEM) signals (Fig. 5b) (see Methods). We obtained strong evidence (PPA  0.8) at 18 CpG sites and 10 genes where variations in DNAm, gene expression and AMD GWAS were attributed to the same variant (Table 1, Supplementary Table 24). Seven of the signi  cant colocalizing variants at 3 known AMD loci ( C2/CFB/SKIV2L , PILRB/PILRA and CNN2 ) corresponded to 3 genes (Fig. 5c). SNP rs67538026 associated with methylation of CpG cg05475770, TMEM259 expression and AMD risk was identi  ed at the CNN2 locus (Fig. 5d), and rs114820183 associated with cg22670819 methylation, DXO expression, and AMD risk at the C2-CFB-SKIV2L locus. DXO was also proposed as a potential AMD gene at this locus by SMR analysis of retina eQTL and AMD GWAS statistics.

These include the SNP rs11072507 associated with methylation of CpG cg21565421, MPI expression and AMD (Fig. 5e), and the SNP rs6493454 associated with CpG cg19881011 methylation, MTMR10 expression and AMD (Extended Data Fig. 7c). We compared CpGs and genes identi  ed in the GM or EM coloc and GEM moloc analyses, and only detected an overlap of 6 CpGs in GM and GME, 4 genes ( KASH5, EHD4, CPLX4 and SNX21 ) common in GEM and EM, and 5 genes ( C8orf58, PDZD7, FN3KRP , SLC16A3, SCAF1 ) common in GE and EM (Extended Data Fig. 7d and 7e). We further overlapped CpGs and genes identi  ed in the SMR analysis (E2M_SMR, M2E_SMR) and EM coloc analysis, and noted 770 CpGs and 544 genes in common in all 3 analyses (Fig. 5f and 5g) (Supplementary Table 25). The CpGs were mapped to potential target genes (mGenes; see Methods), which showed enrichment in pyruvate metabolism and olfactory signaling pathway (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Integrative analysis with Hi-C retina map improves target Finally, to prioritize a high con  dence list of variants that contribute to DNAm and gene expression variation, we integrated loops, CREs and SEs from our recently published retina Hi-C data33 with mQTLs, eQTLs, and eQTMs, and their target genes, and variant associations identi  ed in the SMR, eCAVIAR, coloc and moloc analyses. We observed that 73% of mQTLs, 78% of eQTLs and 82% of eQTMs are localized to the A compartment (representing active transcription chromatin regions) compared to 23% of mQTLs,18% of eQTLs and 16% of eQTMs in the B compartment (representing closed chromatin regions with inactive genes); 4% of e/mQTLs or eQTMs fell in uncategorized chromatin regions (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 26). Most of the retinal mQTLs and eQTLs are present within the A compartment providing a direct mechanism to explain the impact of a variant on the mGene or eGene. We next examined the overlap of Hi-C loop foot locations with mQTL and eQTL variants and their target genes, distinguishing promoter mQTLs/eQTLs ( 2.5 kb from TSS of target gene) from distal mQTLs/eQTLs (> 2.5 kb from TSS) (see Methods), as previously described49. We identi  ed 5,479 mQTLs overlapping a loop foot; of these, 104 (1.8%) interacted with their mGene promoter (promoter mQTLs), 705 (12.8%) were distal mGene mQTLs, 56 (1%) were promoter non-mGene mQTLs, and 4,614 (84.2%) were distal nonmGene mQTLs (Fig. 6b left panel and Supplementary Table 27). Among the 705 distal mGene mQTLs, 2 mQTLs are associated with known AMD loci ( SYN3/TIMP3 and TRPM3 ). For eQTLs, 1,721 overlapped a loop foot; of these, 17 (0.9%) interacted with their eGene promoter (promoter eQTLs), 186 (10.8%) were distal eGene eQTLs, 15 (0.8%) were promoter non-eGene eQTLs, and 1,503 (87.3%) were distal non-eGene eQTLs (Fig. 6b middle panel and Supplementary Table 28). We similarly tested for overlap of promoter eQTMs (CpGs within  2.5 kb from target gene TSS) and distal eQTMs (> 2.5kb from TSS) with retina Hi-C loop foot locations. We identi  ed 3,395 eQTMs overlapping a loop foot; of these, 24 (0.7%) interacted with their target gene promoter (promoter-eQTMs), 282 (8.3%) were promoter non-target gene eQTMs, 195 (5.7%) were distal target gene eQTMs, and 2,894 (85.2%) were distal non-target gene eQTMs (Fig. 6b right panel and Supplementary Table 29).Page 13/40We next evaluated the overlap of retina mQTLs, eQTLs and eQTMs with retinal CREs and SEs that were identi  ed based on epigenetic marks33 (see Methods). We discovered 6,834 CRE-mQTLs and 2,610 SEmQTLs; of which, 2,048 (29.9%) and 271 (10.3%) were promoter-mGene mQTLs, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 8a left panel and Supplementary Table 30). For the retina eQTLs, we ascertained 1,953 CREeQTLs and 773 SE-eQTLs overlaps; of which, 609 (31.1%) CRE-eQTLs and 84 (10.8%) SE-eQTLs were promoter-eGene eQTLs (Extended Data Fig. 8a middle panel and Supplementary Table 31). For eQTMs, we uncovered 8,996 CRE-eQTMs and 1,392 SE-eQTMs; of which, 668 (7.4%) CRE-eQTMs and 88 (6.3%) SE-eQTMs were promoter-eQTMs (Extended Data Fig. 8a right panel, and Supplementary Table 32). We further integrated Hi-C loops, CREs and SEs with target genes, and variant associations identi  ed in our SMR, eCAVIAR, coloc and moloc analyses. In SMR analysis of mQTL and AMD GWAS with CRE, SE and loops, we identi  ed target genes for 3 associations ( MEPCE ; ZCWPW1 and HTRA1 ) at 2 AMD loci (PILRB/PILRA, ARMS2/HTRA1 ) (Supplementary Table 33). For SMR analysis of eQTL and AMD GWAS with CRE, we detected target genes for 2 associations ( STAG3L5P and BLOC1S1 ) at 2 AMD loci (PILRB/PILRA and RDH5/CD63 ) (Supplementary Table 34). In eCAVIAR analysis of mQTL and AMD GWAS with CRE and loops, we found target genes ( ARHGAP21 , KMT2E and LINC01004 ) for 2 colocalizations at 2 loci ( ARHGAP21 and KMT2E/SRPK2 ) (Supplementary Table 35). For E2M_SMR associations, we identi  ed targets genes for 1,058 associations with CRE, 538 associations with SE, and 186 associations with loops (Supplementary Table 36). These analyses also identi  ed high con  dence causal links with Hi-C loops between retina eQTLs and mQTLs, and 1 eQTL/mQTL association with ALDH2 identi  ed in E2M_SMR (Fig. 6c). Similarly, for M2E_SMR associations, we identi  ed targets genes for 609 associations with CRE, 516 associations with SE, and 187 associations with loops (Supplementary Table 37). We determined 3 mQTL/eQTL associations with GSTP1 identi  ed in M2E_SMR (Fig. 6d), and 4 eQTL/mQTL and mQTL/eQTL associations with EML1 noted in E2M_SMR and M2E_SMR (Extended Data Fig. 8b). For coloc EM colocalizations, we identi  ed target genes for 790 colocalizations with CRE, 450 colocalizations with SE and 216 colocalizations with loops (Supplementary Table 38). We also discovered a target gene for coloc EM colocalization in LPIN1 gene with Hi-C loops (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Genes and pathways in  uenced by DNA methylation and To obtain a non-redundant set of genes, we merged the target genes identi  ed in mQTL and AMD GWAS analyses using SMR, eCAVIAR, coloc and moloc. We identi  ed 4 target genes at 3 loci by SMR, 15 target genes at 8 loci using eCAVIAR, 58 target genes at 11 loci using coloc, and 10 target genes at 3 loci using moloc. By combining the target genes from the four methods, we identi  ed a total of 87 non-redundant genes that are in  uenced by DNAm (Supplementary Table 39; 50 of these genes are at the reported AMD GWAS loci and 37 are new target genes. These genes belonged to a range of biological processes including mTOR signaling and RHOF GTPase cycle (Reactome, gPro  ler adj. P  0.05) genetic variants. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the imputed genotype variants after performing LD pruning with variants MAF > 5% and high call rate of > 98%, using Eigenstrat (v6.1.4) to identify outlier samples and principal components (PCs) that captured most of the genotype variation between the samples73,74 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Furthermore, kinship analysis was performed with the kinship option of qctool v2 (https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool_v2/) and related samples (kinship coe cient > 0.8) as well as samples with contradictions in inferred and reported gender according to the AxiomTM analysis suite version 3.1 were excluded. Overall, 4 samples were removed from the Cologne and Munich dataset. After sample QC, a total of 156 samples from both the datasets were considered for mQTL analysis and the top 10 genotype PCs were used in the mQTL model described below (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Raw idat  les from both studies were similarly processed using min   (v1.42.0) pipeline75. Clustering of the median methylated and unmethylated signal showed 4 outliers, which were subsequently removed, leaving 152 samples for further analysis. Inspection of the bisul  te conversion plots indicated poor bisul  te conversion to have caused these outliers. Probes with a detection p-value below  10%) and an average missingness above 3% across all chromosomes. Genotype PCA was performed on LD-pruned SNPs using Eigenstrat (v6.1.4). A total of 403 samples and 8,924,684 imputed variants post-QC were considered for eQTL analysis and the top 10 genotype PCs were used in the eQTL regression model described below. To correct for hidden factors and batch effects and avoid confounding with AMD grade, we applied the supervised SVA method79 (v3.38.0) to the gene expression values, including known batch effects in the model as follows: Gene expression ~ Sample site + MGS + sex + age The set of negative-control genes for supervised SVA were taken from our previously published RNA-seq study29. We identi  ed 21 SVs, and these were further used as covariates in eQTL analysis. The analysis included 403 samples with their corresponding genotype and retina gene expression data for 17,382 genes expressed at  1 CPM in at least 10% of the retina samples. The gene expression values were normalized using Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) in Counts per Million (CPM) using edgeR80,81 (version 3.32.1). QTLtools42 software suite was used for discovery of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Surrogate variables determined by the sva package, disease status (MGS level), age, sex, population strati  cation (top 10 genotype PCs), were used as covariates. We took the optimization approach to identify the minimum number of SVs that maximize the number of eQTLs and eGenes. We tested 21 SVs as covariates during the eQTL mapping and 21 SVs maximized the number of genes and eQTLs at FDR  5% (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Enrichment of mQTL and eQTL variants in functional genomic annotations was assessed using TORUS 44,43 and the following command: torus -d $qtl_statistics -annot $annotation_  le -est --no_dtss --fastqtl. TORUS was run on all signi  cant variant-gene pair summary statistics of all signi  cant CpGs and eGenes at FDR  0.1 plus 50kb on either side of the lead GWAS variant) were tested. All variants that fell within the GWAS locus LD interval were analyzed. A colocalization posterior probability (CLPP) above 0.01 wasPage 23/40considered signi  cant based on prior simulations39.To minimize false positive results, we excluded signi  cant colocalizing GWAS-QTL signals if the me/eQTL and GWAS variants with CLPP > 0.01 did not pass the following signi  cance cutoffs: me/eQTL FDR  2.5 kb from the mGene/eGene were identi  ed as distal mQTLs/eQTLs. The mQTLs/eQTLs variants overlapping a chromatin loop foot were classi  ed based on the location contacted by opposite loop foot; variants in contact with their mGene/eGene promoter were identi  ed as mGene/eGene promoter mQTLs/eQTLs, and variants in contact with a promoter other than the mGene/eGene as non-eGene promoter mQTLs/eQTLs. The mQTLs/eQTLs were checked for overlap with CREs and SEs and subsequently for overlap with the associated mGene/eGene. eQTMs located within  2.5 kb of the TSS of its target gene were identi  ed as promoter eQTMs and while those located > 2.5 kb from the target gene were identi  ed as distal eQTMs. eQTMs CpG which overlap a chromatin loop foot were classi  ed based on the location contacted by opposite loop foot; CpG in contact with their target gene promoter were identi  ed as Gene promoter eQTMs, CpGs in contact with a promoter other than the gene as non-Gene promoter eQTMs. eQTMs were checked for overlap with CREs and SEs and subsequently checked if those regions overlapped the associated with its target gene. All overlaps were performed using GenomicRanges (v1.42) in R. To con rm target genes for associations identi  ed in SMR, colocalizations identi  ed in eCAVIAR, coloc and moloc, variants identi  ed in these associations and colocalizations were overlapped with loops, CRE, andPage 24/40SE. For a loop target gene, one foot of the loop overlaps the variant, and the second foot of the loop overlaps the gene body or TSS of a gene. CRE and SE target genes were de  ned by variant and the gene body (or TSS of a gene) overlapping the same CRE or SE. The closest target genes overlapping with loops, CRE, SE, mQTLs, eQTLs, eQTMs, SMR associations and colocalizations identi  ed in eCAVIAR, coloc and moloc were obtained using the closestBed command from bedtools84 (v2.27.1).

introduction of nonfunctional amino acids at the site of readthrough. AAV-mediated gene augmentation does not correct the underlying mutations. It may yield only a transient effect along - side the innate and adaptive immune responses that diminishes their therapeutic effect, particularly if repeated doses are required. In contrast, gene editing could, in principle, correct the endog - enous gene and permanently reverse the underlying cause of the disease. However, editing using Cas nucleases is limited by the inefficiency of precise editing via homology-directed repair (HDR) in most retinal cell types (1214) . Since HDR is inefficient in nondividing cells such as the RPE, most edited cells will acquire new indel mutations, and cells with 1 corrected allele frequently coinherit a disruptive indel allele. Moreover, double-strand DNA break (DSB) formation at the target site would pose the risk of Clinical genome editing is emerging for rare disease treatment, but one of the major limitations is the targeting of CRISPR editors delivery. We delivered base editors to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in the mouse eye using silica nanocapsules (SNCs) as a treatment for retinal degeneration. Leber congenital amaurosis type 16 (LCA16) is a rare pediatric blindness caused by point mutations in the KCNJ13 gene, a loss of function inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir7.1) in the RPE. SNCs carrying adenine base editor 8e (ABE8e) mRNA and sgRNA precisely and efficiently corrected the KCNJ13W53X/W53X mutation. Editing in both patient fibroblasts (47%) and human induced pluripotent stem cellderived RPE (LCA16-iPSC-RPE) (17%) showed minimal off-target editing. We detected functional Kir7.1 channels in the edited LCA16-iPSC-RPE. In the LCA16 mouse model (Kcnj13W53X/+ R), RPE cells targeted SNC delivery of ABE8e mRNA preserved normal vision, measured by full-field electroretinogram (ERG). Moreover, multifocal ERG confirmed the topographic measure of electrical activity primarily originating from the edited retinal area at the injection site. Preserved retina structure after treatment was established by optical coherence tomography (OCT). This preclinical validation of targeted ion channel functional rescue, a challenge for pharmacological and genomic interventions, reinforced the effectiveness of nonviral genome-editing therapy for rare inherited disorders.

Since the c.158G>A nucleotide change causes KCNJ13 mutation W53X, an ABE-mediated base-editing strategy can potentially correct the mutation through an A>G conversion. To screen ABEs and validate the sgRNAs for their ability to edit this pathogenic locus with functional restoration of the Kir7 .1 channel, we generated human embryonic kidney cells that stably express GFP-tagged KCNJ13-W53X (HEKW53X/W53X) and an isogenic WT control line (HEKWT /WT) in which the WT KCNJ13 sequence was inserted into a single Flp-In recognition target (FRT) site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus (Figure 1, A and B ). We chose the ABE8e base-editing effector due to its high efficiency (34, 35) and designed sgRNAs based on the predicted editing window at protospacer positions 48, counting the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) as position number 2123. Only 1 of the 3 sgRNAs (G*C*G*CUAGCGUUGGAUGAUGU, PAM; TGG) was predicted to have high specificity while also placing the c158G>A position within the editing window of ABE8e (Figure 1C ). We observed 99.7% (99.7%  0.1%) transfection efficiency in HEK293 cells by electroporation of 3  g of GFP mRNA (Supple - mental Figure 3 , AC). Therefore, we tested the activity of ABE8e in mRNA and protein formulations via electroporation. HEKW53X cells were electroporated with either a mixture of ABE8e mRNA and sgRNA or ABE8e:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Deep-sequencing analysis was performed on the treated cells by isolating RNA instead of DNA to distinguish the insert - ed allele from the endogenous allele of the HEK genome. The pool of electroporated HEKW53X cells showed significantly higher AT-to-GC correction efficiency with ABE8e mRNA (53.0%  1.4%) compared with ABE8e RNP (31.4%  3.4%) (Figure 1D ). Our on-target analysis showed comparatively lower indels intro - duced using RNP (1.0%  0.4%) than mRNA (4.2%  1.6%) at and around the protospacer (Figure 1E ). The W53X nonsense mutation in KCNJ13 disrupts its protein expression in HEKW53X cells, so we assessed whether base editing restored Kir7 .1 expression and subcellular localization at the pro - tein level. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the Kir7 .1 protein is present in the membrane in most of the base-edited HEKW53X cells, similar to control HEKWT cells. On the other hand, the fluorescence signal in untreated HEKW53X cells is accumulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus due to its premature truncation (Fig - ure 1F). These results confirmed the successful translation and trafficking of full-length protein after editing (Figure 1F). To determine Kir7 .1 channel function, whole-cell currents were recorded using an automated patch-clamp system from pools of either base-edited HEKW53X cells, untreated HEKW53X mutant cells, or untreated HEKWT cells ( Figure 2, AC ). In a standard external physiological HEPES Ringer (HR) solution, HEKWT cells had a considerable negative membrane potential (74.2  4.2 mV, n = 3 individual cells) (Supplemental Figure 4A). They exhibited an inward rectifying average Kir7 .1 current of 45.0  11.3 pA (n = 62 individual cells) at 150 mV in 5 mM K+. The inward current increased in response to external 140 mM Rb+ (a known activator of the Kir7 .1 channel) by 4.5-fold (204.9  37 .3 pA) (Supplemental Figure 4B ). However, the current was not blocked by adding 20 mM Cs+ (a known blocker of the Kir7 .1 channel) to the bath solution (41.5  11.2 pA), suggesting a low uncontrolled indels and other undesired cellular consequences, such as chromosomal translocations, large deletions, aneuploidy, p53 activation, chromothripsis, or transposon insertions (1524). Base editing has the potential to overcome these limitations by capitalizing on the RNA-guided programmability of CRISPR/ Cas9 to deliver a base-modification enzyme that can site specif - ically convert 1 single nucleotide to another (25) . Most base editors (BE) use a Cas9 nickase fused to an engineered or evolved deaminase enzyme (2628). Adenine base editors (ABEs) install A>G changes, while cytosine base editors (CBEs) install C>T changes, both within a small editing window specified by the sgRNAs (29) . Base editing does not rely on HDR and therefore tends to be efficient in nondividing cells. While delivery of the larger base editor effectors can be challenging, nonviral silica nanocapsules (SNCs) provide certain advantages in that they can transiently and cell specifically deliver a variety of payloads, including nucleic acids and proteins, without integrat - ing into the genome, with decent payload-loading content (~10 wt%) and encapsulation efficiency (>90%) for all of the biologics mentioned above (3032). We recently reported that SNCs decorated with all-trans -retinoic acid (ATRA) could achieve tissuespecific delivery to RPE cells via subretinal injection. This pro - vides an unrealized opportunity to explore SNC-mediated base editor delivery for precise gene correction in LCA16 (33) . Here, we explored the ability of an SNC-delivered base editor to correct the endogenous pathogenic W53X KCNJ13 point mutation in (a) patient-derived fibroblasts, (b) iPSC-derived RPE, (c) heterozygous knockin Kcnj13W53X/+ mice, and (d) WT allele disrupted Kcnj13W53X/+R mice via subretinal injection. Adenine base editor 8e (ABE8e) substantially outperformed a CRISPR/ Cas9 HDR strategy in terms of efficiency and editing precision. SNC-mediated delivery was sufficient to achieve approximately 16% editing of RPE cells in the mouse retina. Moreover, the high editing efficiency of 47% in patient-derived fibroblasts suggests the opportunity to pursue cell therapies using the engraftment of autologous edited and reprogrammed cells. We then demonstrate functional restoration of the Kir7 .1 channel in patient-derived iPSC-RPE and in vivo in the LCA16 mouse (Kcnj13W53X/+R) model, further revealing the potential of CRISPR base editing to preserve vision in LCA16 patients. Our work provides essential proof of concept that base editing via SNC delivery is a viable strategy for preventing the progression of inherited retinal diseases, particularly channelopathies such as LCA16. ABE8e mRNA efficiently corrects the HEKW53X/W53Xcell line . Given the relatively low efficiency and heterogeneous outcomes of the traditional Cas9 nuclease-mediated gene-editing approach (Sup - plementary Note, Supplemental Figure 1, A D, and Supplemental Figure 2 , AH; supplemental material available online with this article; https:/ /doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356DS1), we focused on base editing to correct the W53X mutation. Base editors are engineered proteins that use the programmable DNA-targeting ability of Cas9 to bring a nucleotide basemodifying enzyme to a precise editing window at the target DNA site. We used 3 bio - informatic tools for sgRNA design (see Methods). These guides directed BE, to convert one or more bases, resulting in an altered The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLE3 J Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 Efficient ex vivo base editing in patient-specific fibroblasts using nanoparticles . To explore the specificity of ABE at the endogenous human KCNJ13 locus within patient-specific cells, we encapsulat - ed ABE8e mRNA and sgRNA in SNC-PEG (SNC covalently conjugated with polyethylene glycol [PEG]) nanocapsules (Figure 3A ) (33) for delivery into fibroblasts derived from an LCA16 (W53X homozygous) patient (FibroW53X/W53X). Five days after treatment, we assessed base-editing efficiency using deep sequencing. As expected, the activity of ABE8e yielded efficient AT-to-GC edit - ing (52.3%  0.1%) at the target W53X site (A6). Cells from both the treated and untreated populations (Supplemental Figure 5 , AC) had low levels of other substitutions (or possibly sequencing error) in the amplicon, including bystander A>G and other T>G, T>C, and G>A substitutions, with ABE8e exhibiting 6.5%  1.4% unwanted substitutions and untreated FibroW53X/W53X cells show - ing 2.6%  0.1% unwanted substitutions (Figure 3B ). Rare indel Cs+ sensitivity of the Kir7 .1 channel (Figure 2A ), as reported earlier (1, 34) . These responses were not observed in untreated HEKW53X mutant cells, with a significantly lower resting current amplitude (9.7  1.3 pA) and negligible change upon adding Rb+ or Cs+ (Figure 2B ). Importantly, base-edited HEKW53X/W53X cells exhibited restored Kir7 .1 function in 80% of cells (n = 60) and the characteristic Rb+-responsive K+ current (33.3  7 .7 pA base - line; 415.2  54.0 pA with Rb+, 42.2  9.6 pA with Cs+) (Figure 2C). The K+ current profile of 20% of the treated HEKW53X cells (n = 15) was comparable to that of mutant HEKW53X/W53X untreat - ed cells (n = 40), which we attribute as unedited cells (K+ current in HR; 30.9  8.0 pA, Rb+; 57 .7  12.5 pA, Cs+; 13.9  5.1 pA) (Figure 2C ). From these experiments, we conclude that ABE8e mRNA plus sgRNA delivery can correct the W53X mutation at high efficiency (around 50% of total alleles and in 80% of cells), restoring Kir7 .1 protein levels and K+ conductance.

Unfortunately, the treated cells showed substantially lower AT-to-GC editing efficiency (14.9%  1.7%; P = 0.000027) than ABE8e at the target W53X site (A6). Undesired editing outcomes were also reduced: bystander editing at A14; 0.1%  0.1%, A2; 0.1%  0.1%, A4; 0.2%  0.1%, other observed substitutions (4.7%  0.8%), and indels (1.4%  0.4%) in the amplicon (Supplemental Figure 6 , AC). These results confirmed that ABEs, particularly ABE8e, can efficiently revert the endogenous W53X nonsense mutation to WT in patient-derived fibroblasts. Restoration of Kir7 .1 channel function in patient-derived iPSCRPE. Next, as a model for in vivo gene-editing therapies for LCA16, we applied our base-editing strategy to patient iPSCderived RPE harboring homozygous W53X mutation in KCNJ13. Previous reports suggest that delivery into RPE by lipofection is outcomes were detected in the ABE8e-treated samples (2.7%  0.4%) ( Figure 3B ). Bystander A>G editing near the target nucleo - tide was rare in the ABE8e-treated samples (A14; 0.3%  0.0%, A17; 0.1%  0.0%) (Figure 3C ). We also marked some ABE8e activity upstream of the protospacer at positions A2 (0.3%  0.0%) and A9 (0.1%  0.1%) (Figure 3C ). This bystander editing within and outside the protospacer resulted in silent (L48L) and missense (D50G, M51V, M56V, M57V) mutations (Figure 3D ). Although these mutations were observed at a very low frequency (G edit is marked in orange, and bystander A edits are in green.

Also, transient expression of BE machinery is pre - ferred over long-term expression via AAVs to restrict off-target editing that may accumulate during prolonged exposure to genome editors. So we used SNC-PEG as a delivery vector for ABE8e mRNA. We observed 27 .4%  1.7% transfection efficiency in iPSC-RPE cells using SNC-PEG (Supplemental Fig - ure 7D ). We did not observe any toxicity in the ABE8e-treated iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X, and cell morphology was comparable to that for untreated iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X (Figure 4A ). Deep-sequencing analysis in the base-edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X revealed 17 .8%  1.5% editing of the mutant nucleotide to the WT sequence following ABE8e treatment (Figure 4B ). Fewer than 4% of resultant alleles carried undesired genomic outcomes: indels quantified in treated RPE had a frequency of 0.7% compared with 0.01% in untreated controls, and bystander substitutions quantified in treated RPE totaled 2.9%  0.4% compared with 1.8%  0.1% in untreated controls (Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 7 , AC). Manual patch-clamp electrophysiology was carried out on the pool of base-edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells ( Figure 4D ) to assess the functional rescue of the Kir7 .1 channel. Three types of Kir7 .1 current profiles were observed in the edited iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X pool. Some of the cells (n = 5 out of 13) showed a normal amplitude of K+ conductance (102.0  0.1 pA) in HR solution, which was potentiated in Rb+ external solution by 8-fold (821.0  265.5 pA). These high-responding cells in the pool showed rescue of Kir7 .1 channel function and were most likely to have only W53X>WT correction with or without neutral bystander mutations. Some of the cells did not show any recovery of Kir7 .1 current (HR; 33.7  31.6 pA, Rb+; 80.5  19.4 pA) and had a profile similar to that of iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells (11) . These low-responding cells (n = 4 out of 13) likely experienced no base editing. A few cells (n = 4 out of 13) showed slightly higher Rb+-stimulated current than the untreat - ed iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells, but not as high as iPSC-RPEWT /WT cells. The medium-responding cells showed only a 3-fold Rb+ response (238.7  102.1 pA) for the current amplitude observed in the HR solution (72.6  29.7 pA). We hypothesize that medium-responding cells contain a relatively low number of ion channels translated from a correctly base-edited KCNJ13 allele. The current-sweep plots of the representative cells under different treatment solutions are shown in Figure 4E. Kcnj13W53X/+ monoallelic knockin mouse as an LCA16 model for validating genome editing. A notable limitation to translating our KCNJ13W53X gene-correction strategy to preclinical models is the lack of a mouse model harboring a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the gene. To test base-editing efficiency in vivo, we first sought to create mice carrying a W53X substitution in the Kcnj13 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. In the pronuclei of zygotes, a combination of Cas9 protein, 2 different specific guides to the Kcnj13 locus (GAATCCTAATGGACATGCGCTGG and TAATGGACATGCGCTGGCGCTGG), and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODN) was injected (Figure 5, A and B). Five of 6 newborn mice genotyped by sequencing had only 1 allele with the nucleotide alteration. This result was further validated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to digest the PCR product with the NheI enzyme, which selectively digests the mutant allele (Figure 5C ). We determined that the phenotype of homozygous mice (Figure 5D) generated from breeding heterozygous founders was lethal on postnatal day one. The retinal structure (optical coherence tomography [OCT] images, Figure 5E ) of these heterozygous mice was identical to that of age-matched WT mice. Electrical activity generated by the retina was recorded using ERG as a measure of retinal function in response to a light stimulus. Specific retinal cells generate varying waveforms, a, b, and c waves. The a wave, a negative deflection, corresponds to the photoreceptor. The b wave, which is positive, arises from the inner retinal cells, while the c wave is generated by the RPE cell. Full-field ERG evaluation of het - erozygous mice was identical to that of WT mice (Supplemental Figure 8 , AC), and c wave amplitudes measuring RPE cell function (W53X/+; 455.9  18.7 vs. +/+; 504.5  33.4 V) were not statistically different (P = 0.54) (Figure 5F). We have determined that, unlike in humans, at least 1 normal mouse Kcnj13 gene allele is required for survival beyond postnatal day 1 (7 , 35) , precluding the establishment of a genetic model recapitulating the human recessive disease. Therefore, we used our Kcnj13W53X/+ mice to generate an LCA16 mouse model (Kcnj13W53X/+ R) using a Cas9 nuclease complex targeted to disrupt the WT allele (Figure 5, E and F). The WT allele was edited in the RPE cells by delivering Cas9 mRNA and guide (Supple - mental Table 9) through subretinal delivery of SNCs decorated with ATRA (SNC-PEG-ATRA), which explicitly targets RPE cells. The size and  potential of ABE8e mRNA+sgRNA-encapsulated SNCs are summarized in Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 9 . Mice were evaluated after 6 weeks to demonstrate intact retinal structure (Figure 6E ). ERG measurements of c wave amplitude before the injection were 515.5  9.5  V, but 6 weeks after the disruption, it dropped to 234.2  14.9  V (P = 0.001). A decrease in c wave amplitude by 54% reflects the functional loss of RPE cells, as in LCA16. This disease model was used for the functional validation of base editing in vivo. In vivo base editing via subretinal injection of ABE8e encap - sulated SNCs. We designed sgRNAs targeting the W53X allele (Figure 6A ) of mouse Kcnj13. We validated it in the fibroblasts derived from Kcnj13W53X/+ mice via electroporation (Figure 6B ). To determine the editing efficiency in a heterozygous model system (mouse fibroblasts and in vivo), we delivered using SNC-PEG. We calculated the increase in the WT reads by converting the available W53X allele. We observed a 14.5% increase in the WT reads in the treated fibroblasts, suggesting 29% of cells received an edit (Supplemental Figure 10 ). For in vivo subretinal delivery into Kcnj13W53X/+ mice, ABE8e mRNA, sgRNA, and GFP mRNA were packaged into SNC-PEG-ATRA. GFP-positive areas identified the injection site (Figure 6C), and genomic DNA from GFP-positive RPE tissue and the choroid optic cup were used for deep sequencing analysis of the Kcnj13 gene. We found that delivering 3  g ABE8e mRNA resulted in 16.8%  7 .9% RPE editing while delivering 2 g resulted in 9.5%  5.0% RPE editing (n = 4 eyes for each dose) (Figure 6D ). Our on-target analysis showed no other A>G substitutions outside or within the protospacer region. In addition, indel mutations were not significantly increased over those in placebo-treated mice (Figure 6E ). These data demonstrate the specific editing of the W53X allele in vivo by ABE8e-encapsulated SNC-PEG-ATRA.The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLE7 J Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 Base editing of the LCA16 mutant allele improves RPE function. In our Kcnj13W53X/+ R mice, we used ABE8e mRNA, sgRNA pack - aged in SNC-PEG-ATRA, and administered subretinally to edit the mutant allele. Full-field ERG measurements were performed at weeks 2, 6, and 10 to monitor longitudinal rescue in phenotype (Figure 6F). At week 10, multifocal ERG (mfERG) was performed on injected eyes to determine whether functional recovery was regionalized based on localized delivery of the base-editor complex. For the control group, Kcnj13W53X/+ R was injected with a base editor and a nontargeting guide. The nontargeted guideinjected mice exhibited a progressive decrease in c wave amplitude as well as depressed mfERG waveforms in almost the entire retina. On the other hand, the base-edited eyes showed an increase in the c wave amplitude at all measured time points (Figure 6, GJ). mfERG showed localized waveforms (Figure 6H and Supplemental Figure 11A ) that perhaps correlated with the site of injection (Figure 6C ). On the second week following the injection, the normalized c wave amplitude (to that before the therapy) in eyes receiving the nontargeted guide was 0.8  0.1, practically indistinguishable to that of the eyes Figure 4.

(D) Manual single-cell patch-clamp assays on iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells after treatment with ABE8e. Of the 13 cells assessed for Kir7.1 activity, each could be binned into 1 of 3 classes: low-responding single cells, which appeared to be unedited mutant cells; medium-responding single cells, which showed a low level of Rb+ response; and high-responding single cells, which showed Rb+ response like WT iPSC-RPE cells. The number (n) of cells binned into each class is shown at the top of each graph. (E) Current-sweep plot from a representative cell of each bin across a time course of being exposed to physiological HR solution (gray), Rb+ stimulation (red), and subsequent wash with HR solution (green).The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLEJ Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 8 bulge, where off-target editing is most likely to occur, was identified in the human genome for this sgRNA targeted to W53X. We analyzed the off-target activity of ABE8e in base-edited HEKW53X/W53X, LCAW53X/W53X, and iPSC-RPEW53X/W53X cells at the 9 potential sites (Supplemental Table 5 ). Deep-sequencing analysis of these sites showed that ABE8e treatment did not lead to signif - icant off-target A>G editing or introduction of indels compared with that of untreated control cells except at 1 locus. In particular, this 1 off-target (Off_3: GRCh38:50530925 Intergenic) showed 4 times more substitutions in base-edited HEKW53X/W53X cells. How - ever, this nucleotide is already reported in humans to have a nat - ural A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (rs139941105, minor allele frequency in 1000 Genomes = 0.01) of no known clinical importance (Supplemental Figure 13 , A and B). These data demonstrate that the off-target modification levels of ABE8e at each of the 9 potential sites are much lower than its on-target editing efficiency and overall indicate a favorable off-targetediting profile. To detect in vivo off-target editing, we used genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated from the optic cup of base editortreated het - erozygous Kcnj13W53X/+ mice and screened the 11 top predicted off-target sites by rhAMP-Seq (Integrated DNA Technologies) (Supplemental Table 7). ABE8e treatment introduced on-target W53X>WT correction with an efficiency of 9.5% in these mice. Similarly to what occurred with our in vitro off-target analyses described above, we detected no substantial off-target editing following in vivo editing of mouse RPE (Supplemental Figure 13 , injected with the targeted guide, 0.9  0.2 (P = 0.9). At 10 weeks after injection, the c wave was reduced (0.7  0.1) for the nontargeted retina compared with an increasing trend (1.6  0.1, P = 0.01) (Figure 6K) for the targeted guidedelivered retina. This increase of 55% in amplitude and intact retinal structure, as evaluated by OCT (Figure 6, H and J), demonstrates that inherited retinal channelopathies could be mitigated using base editors. As a further preclinical validation, we determined whether the SNC used to deliver the base editor triggers an immune response. The RPE cells in culture were transduced with either lentivirus, AAV7m8, or AAV5 or were incubated with SNC. Expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN- , IL-1 , IL-1 , IL-6, CD-8, and Iba1, was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). CD8 and Iba1 showed increased expression in virally transduced RPE cells, but not in cells exposed to SNCs (Supplemental Figure 11B ). Off-target analysis of sgRNA for human and murine W53X targets confirms specificity . The Cas9 effector of the ABE dictates the specificity of the base editor to its target site and can bind off-target sites in the genome based on a similarity to the guide sequence. We used an online computational algorithm, Cas-OFFinder (36) , to identify the putative off-target sites for the human W53X sgRNA used above in our ABE8e treatments. We found 2,727 potential off-target sites, most harboring 4 mismatches with 1 nucleotide RNA bulge (n = 2,004) or DNA bulge (n = 512), with other configurations and closer matches occurring much less frequently (Supplemental Figure 12). No off-target site with 2 or fewer mismatches and no DNA/RNA Figure 5. Visual function of Kcnj13W53X/+ mice is similar to that of Kcnj13+/+ mice.

NT , nontargeting sgRNA.The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLE9 J Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLEJ Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 10 with the ABE8e mRNAloaded SNC-PEG, the nanoparticles will stay intact until internalized by the cells. Subsequent to uptake, intracellular GSH will facilitate nanoparticle disassembly and release the encapsulated ABE8e mRNA, enabling targeted base editing within the iPSC-RPE cells. We observed more than 50% on-target editing in patient-derived fibroblasts and 18% in iPSCRPE cells using the SNC-PEG delivery system. For in vivo editing of mouse RPE, we used the ligand-conjugated SNC-PEG-ATRA and observed 16% of RPE cells were edited. The editing of the RPE cells in vivo is confined, a result of targeted subretinal SNC delivery to localized cells around the injection site. We previously showed that the pathological state of RPE can be reversed by rescuing 25% of the Kir7 .1 channel function (11) . A recent trial from Editas (Edit101) introduced indels in the CEP290 gene linked to a different type of LCA, LCA10. It restored visual function in nonhuman primates with more than 10% functional pho - toreceptors (39) . Each RPE sub serves multiple photoreceptors, so 10% RPE correction will rescue many of these photoreceptors. This potential multiplicative effect makes the RPE even more valuable as a target for genome editing. And as with many other ocular diseases, treating LCA16 should not require the correction of all mutant cells. Therefore, the base-editing efficiencies we gained in this study are well within the range of providing considerable therapeutic benefit. Our study demonstrates an important nonviral delivery method for gene correction in vivo with transient exposure to editing reagents. The ABE activity is anticipated to be transient within cells and on the order of a few hours, considering the half-life of Cas9 mRNA (15 minutes to 3 hours) and the halflife of the sgRNA (less than 3 hours) (40) . For our SNC delivered ABE8e to RPE, we have not specifically verified the half-life in our experimental setting, which might be different from what is previously reported. Based on prior studies with transient Cas9 activity, we expect the off-target potential of our nanoparticle treatment to be lower than that of viral-based delivery strate - gies (41) . SNC-mediated base editing can restore Kir7 .1 channel function, as assessed in our edited iPSC-RPE cells and in vivo Kcnj13W53X/+ R mouse studies. Previous studies have demonstrat - ed the functional outcomes of base editing in RPE by correcting a point mutation in the RPE65 enzyme. Base editing restored its enzymatic substrates to support the visual cycle when rescued. Although ion channels such as Kir7 .1 catalyze transmembrane flux of ions, their functional restoration has a less established record of success (42) . On-target bystander substitutions and indels in some iPSC-RPE and in vivo mouse RPE cells are detect - able. Still, they do not interfere with the potential functional benefits of repairing the mutation in the tissue, as these genes are not expressed in the retina. Due to lacking a homozygous LCA16 mouse model, we created an in vivo model by disrupting the WT allele of RPE cells using subretinal delivery of SNC carrying the targeted guide. Our study establishes that in vivo editing with nonviral delivery systems can restore the Kir7 .1 channel function in RPE. The edited Kcnj13W53X/+ R mice displayed recovery of their ERG c wave amplitudes from the edited RPE and had no further retinal degeneration. Additional preclinical validation would require determining safety and efficacy using an acceptable animal model for regulatory clearance. C and D). Together, these results suggest that ABE8e could be an effective and specific method to correct polymorphisms in the genome and that SNCs can serve as effective vehicles to correct mutations in the RPE. Currently, recessive loss-of-function KCNJ13 point mutations are the only known genetic cause of LCA16, disrupting the Kir7 .1 channel function and altering RPE physiology, leading to ret - inal degeneration with progressive vision loss in patients. In the absence of disease-modifying approved therapies, correction of gene mutations in the RPE cells could result in the avoidance of treatment-related serious adverse events (no off-target responses), restore the Kir7 .1 channel function (in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology outcomes), improve vision, or prevent further disease progression (ERG and OCT). Of the 12 different known LCA16-causing KCNJ13 gene mutations (37) , 8 are theoretically accessible by base editors and 5 of those by ABE (requiring A>G [or T>C] edits). Here, we provide essential proof of concept that delivery of ABE8e to RPE via subretinal injection of SNCs can result in correction of the W53X pathogenic allele and restoration of Kir7 .1 channel function in RPE cells. The SNC is a powerful nonviral delivery system for protein and nucleic acids (33) . Our group has previously reported SNCPEGmediated transfection (50% for plasmid and 60% for mRNA), delivery, and GSH-responsive release characteristics (33, 38). The mRNA transfection efficiency remained unaffected at GSH concentrations lower than 0.5  103 M, suggesting extra - cellular stability of SNC-PEG (considering plasma/extracellular GSH concentration ranges from 106 M to 2 105 M). However, at GSH concentrations of 0.5  103 M or higher (corresponding to cytosol GSH concentrations between 103 M and 102 M), a remarkable decrease in the mRNA transfection efficiency was observed, indicating SNC-PEG can effectively break down in the cytosol to release the payload readily.

The primers used for in-fusion cloning and Sanger sequencing are listed in Supplemental Table 2 . Patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE cell culture and mainte - nance . Fibroblasts derived from a skin biopsy of an LCA16 patient ( 7, 1 1 ) with homozygous W53X mutation in KCNJ13 were cultured and maintained in complete DMEM high-glucose medium containing 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep at 37C with 5% CO2. iPSCs, reprogrammed from patient-derived fibroblasts, were cultured on Matrigel and differentiated to iPSC-RPE using an approach similar to that previously described (11, 44) . Briefly, on day 0 (D0) of differentiation, iPSCs were lifted using ReLeSR (Stem Cell Technologies; catalog 05872) to generate embryoid bodies (EBs). The EBs were maintained overnight in mTeSR+ con - taining 10  M ROCK inhibitor (R&D Systems; catalog Y-27632). Then, over the next 3 days, the EBs were gradually transitioned to neural induction medium (NIM) (DMEM: F12 1:1, 1% N2 supple - ment, 1 MEM nonessential amino acids [MEM NEAA], 1 GlutaMAX, and 2  g/mL heparin; MilliporeSigma). On D7 , EBs were plated on Nunc 6-well plates coated with laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 23017015; diluted 1:20 in DMEM/F12). On D16, neurospheres were mechanically lifted. The remaining adherent cells were transitioned to retinal differentiation medium (RDM) (DMEM/F12 [3:1], 2% B27 without retinoic acid, 1% antibioticantimycotic solution) and allowed to differentiate to RPE. RDM was supplemented with 10  M SU5402 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog SML0443-5MG) and 3  M CHIR99021 (BioGems, catalog 2520691) for the first 4 medium changes. After more than 60 days of differentiation, iPSC-RPE cells were purified as  and cultured on the desired surface (45) . Briefly, cultures with dif - ferentiated patches of iPSC-RPE were dissociated using 1X TrypLE Select Enzyme (Thermo Fisher, catalog 12563011) and enriched for iPSC-RPE via magnetically activated cell sorting using anti-CD24 and anti-CD56 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec). iPSC-RPE cells in the negative cell fraction were seeded on the desired surface precoated with laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 23017015; diluted 1:20 in DMEM/F12) and cultured. SNCs for adenine base editing and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We recently reported a safe and efficient nanoplatform, SNC, for delivering CRISPR gene-editing and base-editing components (33) . SNCs were synthesized using a water-in-oil microemulsion method. The oil phase (1 mL) was prepared by mixing Triton X-100 (885  L) with hexanol (0.9 mL) and cyclohexane (3.75 mL). An aliquot of aqueous solution (25  L) containing the desired payload (ssODN or base editor mRNA+sgRNA, with a total nucleic acid concentration of 2 mg/mL) was mixed with the silica reagents: tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (4 L), bis(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)-disulfide (BTPD) (6  L), and N-(3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (TESPIC, 1 mg). The synthesis of TESPIC was reported previously (33) . This mix - ture was homogenized by pipetting and then added to the oil phase (1 mL). The water-in-oil microemulsion was formed by vortexing for 1 minute. Under vigorous stirring (1,500 rpm), an aliquot of 30% aqueous ammonia solution (4  L) was added, and the water-in-oil microemulsion was stirred at 4C for 12 hours to obtain unmodified SNCs. Ace - tone (1.5 mL) was added to the microemulsion to precipitate the SNCs. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation (15,000g ) and washed twice with ethanol and 3 times with ultrapure water. The purified A limitation of our study is that we do not yet know the clonal editing outcomes of cells edited in vitro or in vivo. The combina - tion of alleles in a single cell is a critical parameter for the function of the tetrameric Kir7 .1 channel. Correction of just a single allele, while having detrimental edits in fellow alleles, will likely not preserve RPE health to an extent similar to that of a biallelic correction or monoallelic correction without alteration in the second allele. A clonal analysis would reveal the precise editing outcomes per cell. It could distinguish the phenotypic impact of edited genotypes (43) . However, RPE cells from iPSC-RPE and mouse eyes are postmitotic, making clonal amplification of edited cells experimentally intractable in these systems. In conclusion, while addressing several applicable challenges in correcting an LCA16-causing pathogenic mutation in the Kir7 .1 channel, our study provides proof-of-concept therapy for a rare disease. Importantly, base editing of the KCNJ13W53X allele in vitro and in vivo showed specificity for the W53X mutation without generating detrimental on-target bystander substitutions, indels, or off-target edits elsewhere in the genome. K+ conductance in iPSC-RPE in vitro and c wave recovery in Kcnj13W53X/ in vivo confirmed the functional rescue of the Kir7 .1 channel following base editing. The specific delivery of base editor tools to RPE via the nonviral SNC platform provides a powerful emerging tool for tissue-specific delivery of mRNA or protein-based gene editing therapeutics with good biocompatibility, the ability to package large cargo, increased safety profile, and streamlined manufacturing. These advances will likely direct future preclinical and clinical applications of base editing for correcting mutations causing LCA16 and other ocular genetic diseases. HEK Flp-In 293 stable cells with GFP-tagged WT and W53X Kir7 .1 expression . HEK Flp-In 293 host cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R75007) were generated using a pFRT /lacZeo target site vector to express GFPtagged Kir7 .1 (WT and W53X). These cells contain a single Flp recombination target (FRT) site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus to allow stable integration of the GFP-tagged human KCNJ13 sequence (WT and W53X). As these cells express the zeocin gene under the SV40 early promoter, complete DMEM high-glucose medium (10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin [Pen-Strep], 2 mM l -glutamine) containing 100 g/mL zeocin was used for maintenance. The GFP-WT or GFP-W53X hKCNJ13 gene sequence was integrated into the genome of these cells based on the manufacturers guidelines. Briefly, the cells were cotransfected with FLP-In expression vector (pcDNA5/FRT) containing the GFP-tagged hKCNJ13 sequence (WT or W53X) creat - ed by in-fusion cloning and pOG44 recombinase expression plasmid. The pOG44 plasmid with constitutive expression of the Flp recombinase under the CMV promoter mediates the homologous recombination between the FRT sites of host cells and the expression vector such that the construct from the vector is inserted into the genome at the FRT site. This insertion brings the hygromycin B resistance gene into the frame, inactivates the zeocin fusion gene, and expresses the gene of interest under the CMV promoter. Forty-eight hours after cotransfection, the cells were passaged at 25% confluency to select stable transfectants in 200 g/mL of hygromycin B. The hygromycin Bresistant cell clones (n = 1520) were picked, maintained in 100 g/mL hygromycin B, and further expanded for their characterization The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLEJ Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 12 target vector plasmid contains a copy of the LCA guide, Cas9 protein, and mCherry reporter transgene driven by the EF-1 promoter. Cell culture supernatant was collected from HEK293 after transfection and was concentrated at 1,500g for 45 minutes. The concentrated lentivirus titer was between 107 and 1010 particles/mL, estimated via functional testing in HEK293 cells. Gene editing in iPSC-RPE using lentiviral transduction to deliver Cas9, sgRNA, and SNC to deliver ssODN. For our attempt to edit the KCNJ13 gene carrying a W53X nonsense mutation, we used viral transduction to deliver Cas9 and a sgRNA (TAATGGACATGCGCTAGCGT) to the mature iPSC-RPE cells. We used lentiviral vectors (100 MOI) designed explicitly for this purpose: lentiCRISPR v2-mCherry (Addgene plasmid 99154), a gift from Agata Smogorzewska, with the annealed sgRNA oligonucleotides cloned into it using the BsmB1 enzyme digestion and ligation. Successful integration of the sgRNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing with the primer 5-GGACTATCATATGCTTAC - CG-3 for the U6 promoter, which also drives sgRNA expression. Lentivirus was generated in-house using the method described above. This lentivirus was used to transduce mature iPSC-RPE cells to express Cas9, sgRNA, and the reporter gene mCherry, allowing easy identification of transduced cells. After 6 hours of viral transduction, 3  g of the HDR repair template for W53X gene correction, ssODN-ATTO488 (GATGCTTGGGG GATCCTAATGGA TATGCGCT GGCGTTGGAT - GATGTTA GTCTTTTCTGCTTCT; bold letters show the wobble changes), was delivered to the cells using SNC and incubated for 48 hours. Papain digestion was used to dissociate cells that expressed both red and green fluorescent markers, indicating that they had received both Cas9+sgRNA and ssODN constructs, into a single cell that was then used for patch-clamp experiments. Base editing in Kir7 .1-HEK293 stable cells by electroporation. HEK293 stable cells expressing KCNJ13W53X-GFP were subcultured 24 hours before nucleofection at 70% confluency. The ABE8e mRNA (spCas9-NG, 3  g) (49) and sgRNA (100 pmol) or RNP complex formed by incubating the mixture of ABE8e protein (3  g) and sgRNA (100 pmol) at room temperature for 10 minutes was intro - duced via electroporation; 1  105 cells were electroporated using the FS-100 program in the Lonza 4D nucleofector according to the manufacturers guidelines. After electroporation, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and maintained in complete DMEM medium containing 100  g/mL hygromycin B for further analysis. Base editing in LCA16-patients specific fibroblasts and iPSC-RPE by SNCs. The W53X-LCA16-patients specific fibroblasts (FibroW53X) were subcultured 1 day before treatment. For base editing, ABE8e mRNA (3 g) and sgRNA (100 pmol) were delivered to fibroblasts using SNCs. Five days after treatment, DNA was isolated for genomic analysis. For base editing in iPSC-RPE, the cells were first seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells per well in RDM containing 10% FBS and 10 M ROCK inhibitor (R&D Systems; catalog Y-27632). On D2, the media was switched to RDM containing 2% FBS. On D3 after seeding, ABE8e mRNA (3 g) and sgRNA (100 pmol) were delivered to the cells using SNCs in RDM. the iPSC-RPE monolayer was dissociated 2 days after treatment with SNC-ABE8e. Cells were seeded on Transwell inserts and also collected for gDNA analysis. iPSC-RPE cells transitioned to Transwell inserts and were cultured for 4 to 6 weeks to obtain a polarized monolayer of RPE and subsequently analyzed for Kir7 .1 channel function by the whole-cell patch-clamp approach. Untreated cells were used as references. SNCs were collected by centrifugation (15,000g ). The as-prepared, unmodified SNC was redispersed in ultrapure water (1 mL). For surface modification, methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (mPEG-silane) or a mixture of mPEG-silane and amine-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (NH2-PEG-silane, Mn = 5000) (molar ratio of mPEG-silane: NH2PEG-silane = 8:2) was added to the SNC suspension mentioned above for the synthesis of SNC-PEG without ATRA (i.e., SNC-PEG) or SNCPEG-NH2 (for ATRA conjugation), respectively. The total amount of PEG was 10 wt% of SNC. The pH of the suspension was adjusted to 8.0 using a 30% aqueous ammonia solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting SNCs were purified by washing with ultrapure water 3 times and concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (MilliporeSigma). ATRA was conjugated onto SNC-PEG-NH2 via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) catalyzed amidation. Payload-encapsulated SNC-PEG-NH2 (0.5 mg) was redispersed in 1 mL DI water. EDC (7 .5  g), NHS (4.5  g), and a DMSO solution of ATRA (6 g in 5  L DMSO) were added to the above solution. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours, and then the resulting ATRA-conjugated SNC (i.e., SNC-PEG-ATRA) was washed with water 3 times. The SNC-PEG-ATRA was concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters to a payload concentration of 2 mg/mL before use. Materials used were as follows: TEOS, Triton X-100, acetone, etha - nol, EDC, NHS, and ammonia (30% water) (purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hexanol and cyclohexane were purchased from the Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. DMSO was purchased from Alfa Aesar. BTPD was purchased from Gelest Inc. mPEG-silane (Mn = 5000) and amine-poly (ethylene glycol)-silane (NH2-PEG-silane, Mn = 5000) were purchased from Biochempeg Scientific Inc. ATRA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Base-editor mRNAs . Using their mammalian-optimized UTR sequences, base-editor mRNAs were obtained as a custom product from Trilink Biotechnologies. The mRNAs were synthesized with complete substitution of uracil by N1-methylpseudouridine and cotranscriptional 5 capping with the CleanCap AG analog resulting in a 5 Cap1 structure and included a 120 nucleotide polyA tail. sgRNA design. The sgRNAs targeting the W53X location in the human KCNJ13 gene were designed using Benchling (https:/ /www. benchling.com). The design was validated with 2 other online tools, CRISPR-RGEN (46) and PnB Designer (47) , to confirm its on-target specificity (Supplemental Table 8 ). Only 1 sgRNA (Figure 1C ) appeared to be very specific for the W53X location, as it would allow the binding of the spCas9 domain to the target locus that positions c.158G>A site within the editing window of ABE (48 for ABE8e, counting the PAM as 2123). This sgRNA also had the highest on-target score (65.7) and lowest off-target score (56.8) among the Benchling-designed sgRNAs. The sgRNA targeting mouse Kcnj13 was also selected based on the above criteria (highest on-target score, 57 .1; lowest off-target score, 56.8). The chemically modified forms of these sgRNAs (human, G*C*G*CUAGCGUUGGAUGAUGU; mouse, G*C*G*CUAGCGCUG - GAUGAUGC) were ordered from Synthego. Generation of the lentiviral vector for Cas9-mediated gene editing . Lentivirus was manufactured for Cas9-mediated editing as described in Gandara, Carolina, et al. (48). Briefly, the HEK293 cells were plated and ready for transfection 24 hours after plating. The cells were transfected with the target plasmid when they reached 70% confluence, along with the packaging gene plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2. The The Journal of Clinical Investigation RESEARCH ARTICLE13 J Clin Invest. ;133(19):e171356 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI171356 On-target analysis by deep sequencing. Treated and untreated cells were dissociated using enzymatic treatment (Accutase/Papain) according to the manufacturers instructions for genomic analysis. From the HEK293 stable cells, total RNA (QIAGEN, 74134) was iso - lated, reverse transcribed to cDNA (Thermo Fisher, 4368814), and subsequently amplified for on-target analysis using KCNJ13 Illuminaspecific primers (Supplemental Table 3 ). From fibroblasts, iPSCRPE, and mouse optic cups, gDNA was isolated according to the manufacturers guidelines (Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit, D4069) and quantified using Nanodrop  or Qubit (Thermo Fisher). For deep sequencing of the KCNJ13 locus, gDNA was amplified using Illumina-specific primers with adapter sequences (amplicon size, 150 bp) (Supplemental Table 4 ). Unique indexes (i7 and i5) were ligated to each custom amplicon by PCR (amplicon size, 250 bp), and the indexed amplicons were pooled and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). The indexed library was run on an Illumina MiniSeq instrument with a read length of 150 bp. Deep-sequencing data were analyzed using RGEN Cas-analyzer (51) and CRISPResso2 (52) software. Off-target analysis by deep sequencing. The potential off-target sites for the hW53X-sgRNA were identified by an in silico tool, Cas-OFFinder (36) . The parameters used were an NG/NGG/NAG PAM with up to 4 mismatches to the sgRNA sequence (Supplemental Table 5 and Supplemental Figure 12). We also considered a DNA and RNA bulge of 1 nucleotide, which occurs due to an extra unpaired base in the DNA sequence concerning sgRNA or an extra unpaired base in sgRNA for DNA sequence in the genome, respectively. From the treated and untreated stable cells, fibroblasts, and iPSC-RPE, gDNA was isolated and amplified using primers specific to off-target sites. All the primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 6 . Deepsequencing and data analysis were performed as described above. rhAmp off-target analysis in W53X mice. As the gDNA yield from the mouse optic cup was too low to amplify all the off-target sites separately, we used a highly efficient RNase H2-dependent (rhAmp) PCR technique that can amplify different targets using a single PCR reaction. Amplification and sequencing were performed according to IDT rhAmp instructions. The rhAmpSeq CRISPR panel was designed using the IDT designing tool (https:/ /www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/ rhampseq-design-tool) for the potential off-targets of mW53X-sgRNA identified using Cas-OFFinder (Supplemental Table 7). The amplicon library was prepared using the rhAmpSeq CRISPR Library Kit (IDT, 10007317) and rhAmpSeq i5 and i7 index primers. The purified library was sequenced on the MiniSeq instrument from Illumina. Sequencing analysis was performed using the IDT rhAMP CRISPR analysis tool (https:/ /www.idtdna.com/site/ analysislab). Immunocytochemistry . Kir7 .1 protein expression was assessed in the pool of W53X-mutant, WT, and base-edited HEK293 stable cells by immunocytochemistry as described earlier (10) . As the protein is GFP tagged, GFP mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Cell Signaling, 2955, 1:250) was used to enhance the Kir7 .1 protein expression for its detection in the cells. Sodium potassium ATPase rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (Thermo Fisher, ST0533, 1:500) was used to label the cell membranes. Alexa Fluor 594conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Pro - teintech, SA00006.8, 1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Proteintech, SA00006.5, 1:500) secondary antibodies were used. DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Immunostained cells were imaged on a confocal microscope (Nikon C2 Instruments).Generating the Kcnj13W53X/+ knockin mouse model. The Kcnj13W53X mouse model was generated by Cyagen Biosciences using CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Exon 2 was selected as the target site for the intended base change knockin using 2 distinct guides and a donor sequence. For HDR, the donor oligo carried the muta - tion p.W53* (TGG to TAG) flanked by 120 bp homologous sequences combined on both sides. Microinjections of Cas9 protein, sgRNA mixture, and ssODN were made into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs. The embryos were then transplanted to the pseudopregnant mice, and the resulting progeny were genotyped using PCR and RFLP to validate the desired gene mutation. OCT . OCT was performed on mice anesthetized with ketamine/ xylazine and whose pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide using the Spectralis HRA+OCT system (Heidelberg Engineering Inc.). The mice were placed on a heating pad that was maintained at 37C throughout the procedure, and a drop of artificial tear was applied before placing the corneal lens to keep the eyes from drying out. The images were captured and analyzed with Heidelberg Eye Explorer software (version 1.10.0.0). ERG in mice . ERG was performed in mice using a standard protocol described elsewhere before and after the base editing to evaluate the function of the retina. Briefly, the mice were dark adapted overnight prior to ERG. ERG signals were captured in full darkness using an Espion Ganzfeld full-field system (Diagnosys LLC). When using a contact electrode, a drop of 2% hypromellose solution was applied to the eye in order to keep the cornea wet and make electrical contact. Mice were subjected to mfERG testing with the Celeris system (Diagnosys LLC), in which the retina is divided into 19 hexagonal areas and stimulated by a pseudo - random sequence of black and white hexagons that alternate multiple times per second. Data acquired were analyzed with Espion software (Diagnosys LLC; version V6.0.54) and Origin  (OriginLab Corp.). For a and b waves, the eyes were exposed to a series of flash intensities (0.03 to 30 cd.s/m2) using a ganzfeld dome for 400 ms with a 2-second interval between flashes. For c waves, the eyes were exposed to 25 cd.s/ m2 for 4 seconds. Animals were subjected to ERG every 2 weeks. Base editing in mice . C57BL/6J male and female mice (Kcn - j13W53X/+) were housed at the animal facility at University of Wisconsin Madison under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle at a controlled temperature (25  5C) and humidity (40%50%). The mice were genotyped using standard PCR methods with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 , followed by digestion with restriction enzyme NheI (Anza IVGN0066, Thermo Fisher). The W53X mutation creates a restriction site for NheI, and therefore the W53X allele resulted in 2 (212 bp and 302 bp) fragments compared with only 1 (514 bp) fragment in the WT allele ( Supplemental Figure 14 ). W53X-targeting sgRNA was designed and validated in mouse fibroblasts (50) isolated from Kcnj13W53X/+ mice. A subretinal injection (2  L) of SNC-PEG-ATRA encapsulating ABE8e mRNA (2 and 3  g), W53X-targeting sgRNA (Supplemental Table 9) (100 pmol), and GFP mRNA (1  g, to visualize the site of injection) was performed in mice (n = 4 eyes). PBS or empty SNC-PEG-ATRA (n = 4) injected eyes were used as references. Five days after injection, imag - ing was carried out to assess the delivery based on GFP reporter mRNA. gDNA was isolated from the optic cup of these mice to determine the on-target and off-target effects of base editing. To determine the editing efficiency in this monogenic W53X mouse model at the cellular level, any increase in the WT reads after base editing of the W53X allele was noted and doubled to get the number of cells edited.

A high-throughput automated patch clamp (Q Patch II, Sophion) was used to measure the whole-cell current from the HEKWT, HEKW53X, and base-edited HEKW53X stable cells as described earlier (53) . Briefly, the cells were grown in a T75 flask for 48 to 72 hours and then detached gently using Detachin. The cells were centrifuged at 90g for 1 minute and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 25 mM HEPES. The cells (3 M/ mL) were kept on a shaker for 20 minutes before the experiment. Forty-eight cells were recorded in parallel on single-hole disposable Qplates with individual amplifiers. A pressure protocol was used to achieve cell positioning (70 mbar), Giga seal (75 mbar), and whole-cell configuration (5 pulses with 50 mbar increment between the pulses, first pulse of 250 mbar). The current was recorded in response to voltage-clamp steps from the holding potential (10 mV) to voltages between 140 mV and +40 mV ( = 10 mV). More than 70% of the cells completed the experiment or run. The cells in which the stability was compromised during the experiment were judged by the leak current and excluded from the analysis. The extracellular solution contained the following: 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7 .4 and osmolarity 305 mOsm. The intracellular solution contained the following: 30 mM KCl, 83 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.1 mM GTP, pH adjusted to 7 .2 and osmolarity 280 mOsm. In an alternative external solution, NaCl was replaced with RbCl (140 mM) and used as an enhancer of Kir7 .1 current. An extracellular solution with 20 mM Cs+ was used to block the Kir7 .1 current. The data were analyzed using Sophion Analyzer, version 6.6.44. Whole-cell manual patch-clamp recording of base-edited hiPS-RPE cells was performed according to the standard protocol described elsewhere (7). There was no reporter or selection marker to aid in identifying the recipient or edited cells. Therefore, these cells were picked up randomly for the electrophysiology assay. Statistics . The data analysis was done using Origin software (Origin , OriginLab Corp.) and expressed as mean  SEM. Twotailed, unpaired Students t test was used to determine statistical differences. One-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparison, followed by Tukeys honestly significant difference (HSD) method for adjustment of multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Study approval. All work with LCA16 patient-derived cells (fibro - blasts, iPSCs, and iPSC-RPE) was carried out following institutional, national, and international guidelines and approved by the University of WisconsinMadisons Institutional Review Board and Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. The animal protocols followed the ARVO Statement for use in ophthalmic and vision science research and were approved by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Animal Care and Use Committee.

Impact of next generation with inherited macular dystrophies. Sci.;63(2):11.  assess the potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterizecasesdiagnosedwithautosomalrecessive(ar)orsporadic(s)maculardystrophies (ar/sMD) and describe their mutational spectrum. METHODS.A cohort of 1036 families was classified according to their suspected clinical diagnosisStargardt disease (STGD), cone and cone-rod dystrophy (CCRD) or other maculopathies (otherMD). Molecular studies included genotyping microarrays, Sanger sequencing, NGS, and sequencing of intronic regions of the ABCA4gene. Clinical reclassification was done after the genetic study. RESULTS.At the end of the study, 677 patients (65%) had a confirmed genetic diagnosis, representing 78%, 63%, and 38% of STGD, CCRD, and otherMD groups of patients, respectively. ABCA4is the most mutated gene in all groups, and a second pathogenic variantwasfoundin76%ofSTGDpatientswithonepreviouslyidentifiedmutated ABCA4 allele. Autosomal dominant or X-linked mutations were found in 5% of cases together with not-MD genes ( CHM, EYS, RHO, RPGR, RLBP1, OPA1 ,a n d USH2Aamong others) leading to their reclassification. Novel variants in the very rare genes PLA2G5 andTTLL5 revealed additional phenotypic associations. CONCLUSIONS .This study provides for the first time a genetic landscape of 1036 ar/sMD families according to their suspected diagnosis. The analysis of >200 genes associated with retinal dystrophies and the entire locus of ABCA4increase the rate of characterization, even regardless of available clinical and familiar data. The use of the suspected a priori diagnosis referred by the clinicians, especially in the past, could lead to clinical reclassifications to other inherited retinal dystrophies. Keywords: Inherited macular dystrophies, genetics, next generation sequencing, clinical reclassification, autosomal recessive Inherited macular dystrophies (MD) comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by bilateral central visual loss and atrophy of the macula and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).The hallmark of these diseases is a loss of visual acuity, that could affect people in every age. The genetic spectrum of MD is very heterogeneous. All patterns of inheritance have been associated with these diseases. The different forms of macular degeneration encompass a wide range of clinical and histological findings.1Different types of MD include recessive juvenile Stargardt disease,2dominant forms of Best disease,3adult vitelliform macular disease,4pattern dystrophies,5X-linked(XL) juvenile retinoschisis,6and age-related macular degeneration,7among others. Other inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD), such as cone and cone-rod dystrophies (CCRD), are commonly clinically related with MD because they also involve progressive degeneration or dysfunction of the central retina due to photoreceptor degeneration and lead to a similar vision loss.8Fullfieldelectroretinography(ERG)recordingshelpto distinguish among these related diseases, with normal findings in MD, only reduced cone responses in cone dystrophies (CD) and both cone and rod responses reduced in cone-rod dystrophies (CRD). iovs.arvojournals.org|ISSN: 1552-5783 1 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. Genetic Landscape of Inherited Macular Dystrophies IOVS | February  | Vol. 63 | No. 2 | Article 11 | 2 Stargardt disease (STGD), the most frequent maculopathy, was described as a neuroepithelial disease affecting cones, RPE, and the underlying choroid.9Autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1; OMIM no. 248200) is caused by biallelic mutations in the ABCA4gene.10This gene is also associated to CRD, depending on the severity of the variants found in patients.1115More than 1200 disease-causing ABCA4variants have been described, including missense, nonsense, small indels, copy-number,16and, more recently, non-canonical splice site and deep intronic variants that lead to splicing defects.1722This remarks the importance of sequencing noncoding regions in STGD patients and performing functional assays to unveil the pathogenicity of noncoding variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow studying a high number of genes and patients parallelly using exome-targeted approaches or customized gene panels to also include noncoding regions and identifying new candidate genes.23In the pre-NGS era, genetic testing of IRD patients was performed using genotyping microarrays or Sanger sequencing,which were time-consuming and had low diagnostic rates due to failure to detect previously unknown mutations or new genes. In this work we report the findings achieved before and after the implementation of NGS for the study of a large cohort of 1036 autosomal recessive or sporadic MD and CCRD (hereinafter, ar/sMD) families at the Genetic Department of the University Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, an IRD reference laboratory testing the largest number of IRD patients in Spain.24Almost 70% of ar/sMD patients had a molecular diagnosis at the end of this study, and we highlightthemostfrequentgenesanddescribemutationsinvery rare genes that had not been identified previously in the worldwide population. A cohort of 1036 unrelated families with ar/sMD was recruited at the Fundacion Jimenez Diaz University Hospital (HUFJD, Madrid, Spain) since  up to October . Our laboratory receives internal and external referrals for patients with suspected IRD from different genetic and ophthalmologic services throughout Spain. DNA samples werecollectedfromtheHUFJDBiobank,andallparticipants or their legal guardians signed an informed consent before being included in this study. This study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of our institution. Patients were included when they were referred to the and were classified according to it: (I) STGD cases, patients with a clinical suspicion of STGD or fundus flavimaculatus; (II) CCRD cases, patients with a clinical suspicion of CD or CRD;and (III) otherMD cases,patients referred with a suspicion of macular dystrophy, Best disease, vitelliform macular dystrophy, drusen maculopathy, pattern dystrophy, central areolar choroidal dystrophy, and retinoschisis. Inaddition,theywereclassifiedaccordingtotheavailable data about the inheritance pattern in: (I) autosomal reces-sive (ar), when there were two or more affected individuals in the same generation (N =283), (II) sporadic cases, in families with a single diagnosed patient reported (N =707), or (III) unknown (N =46), when clinicians did not report family information. Patients referred with an a priori dominant (AD) or XL pattern of inheritance were excluded. more genetic approaches (Supplementary Table S1). Until , screening of patients with suspicion of ar/sMD was performed most commonly by genotyping microarrays and Sanger sequencing of coding regions of ABCA4as first-tier testing approaches.2528Some unsolved patients were also screened by NGS when they gave their permission and DNA had enough quality,sequencing the genomic ABCA4locus29 and using small NGS-targeted gene panels for up to 82 IRD genes.30A few families were also analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES).31,32 After the implementation of NGS in our laboratory in ,screening of new cases is routinely performed by clinical exome-targeted approaches prioritizing up to 229 IRDassociated genes.30,3335A few cases were sequenced for the ABCA4gene(AsperBiogene,Tartu,Estonia).Formostofthe studied unsolved cases in which one pathogenic variant was found in ABCA4, several approaches were further applied depending on their availability: gene panels covering specific noncoding ABCA4variants previously reported,36 the targeted sequencing of the complete coding or noncodingABCA4 regions,22or Sanger sequencing of specific ABCA4deep intronic variants known to be prevalent in Spanish population (c.4253 +43G>A, c.4539 + >T, and c.5196 +1137G >A)35(Supplementary Table S1). In all these analyses, variants were prioritized and their pathogenicity was established following the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics,37as previously described.34 Different analyses were performed considering: (I) clinical groups (STGD, CCRD and otherMD); (II) genotype status: (a) biallelic ABCA4patients; (b) other IRD-associated genes; (c) monoallelic ABCA4patients; and (d) unsolved patients; and (III) period of their study: (before and after , when implementing exome sequencing). McNemar test and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were done using R version 4.0.3. Until October , a total of 1036 ar/sMD cases had been studied, 744 recruited until , and 292 new cases recruited during  period. Of them, 570, 223, and 243presentedaclinicalsuspecteddiagnosisofSTGD,CCRD, and otherMD, respectively. approaches as genotyping microarrays or Sanger sequencing were used to study 523 patients.

This gene also explained one-third (58/183) and 5.7% (6/107) of the characterized CCRD patients and otherMD patients, respectively. Pathogenic variants in other genes were identified in 17% (31/183) and 11% (12/107) of CCRD and otherMD cases, respectively. Finally, 364 patients remained unsolved, including 60 that were monoallelic for ABCA4.(B) After exome sequencing and screening of ABCA4introns. A total of 1036 ar/sMD cases were studied or restudied by the end of this study,October .Three quarters of STGD patients (425/570) were characterized with biallelic ABCA4mutations, 3% (19/570) presented a single pathogenic variant in this gene, and 3% (19/570) presented mutations in other IRD genes. The 19% (107/570) of studied patients remained genetically unsolved. Among the CCRD cases,a 38% (85/223) were found to carry mutations in ABCA4,and one-quarter (55/223) presented mutations in other IRD genes. In the case of otherMD patients, 14% (35/243) presented biallelic ABCA4pathogenic variants, whereas 24% (58/243) carried mutations in other genes.

In this work, we report the genetic diagnosis of 1036 ar/sMD families studied for 30 years. The genetic testing options for studying patients with IRD are numerous and have progressed over time.39First approaches used in our laboratorygenotyping microarrays and Sanger sequencingbefore NGS allowed characterizing half of studied patients, most of them carrying ABCA4pathogenic coding variants. In recent years, NGS technologies have had a substantial impact in the molecular diagnosis of IRD patients.23Here, theuseofcustomizedNGS-basedpanelscovering >70genessolved nearly 40% of ar/sMD cases, whereas their use for other IRD families of our cohort showed variable mutation rates of 27% and 57% in autosomal dominant and recessivecases,respectively.40,41Therestudyofunsolvedcasesby the implementation of clinical exome sequencing >200 IRD genes or noncoding regions of ABCA4have allowed characterizing the 58% of the restudied cases. When clinical exome was used as the first-tier approach in the new cases, the characterization rate decreased to 52%. Other authors using NGS custom gene panels of >300 IRD-associated genes and noncoding regions reported a diagnosis yield of 85%.42The differences in the characterization rate found between the restudied cases and the new cases can be explained by several reasons. First, both cohorts have been recruited in different periods of time and do not have the same number of patients in each clinical group. Although most of the restudied patients have a STGD diagnosis (52%), new cases included more otherMD diagnosis (46%) than STGD diagnosis (40%). As we have seen in this study, in this otherMD clinicalgroup,thereisthehighestrateofunsolvedcases. We suggest that in this miscellaneous group where most of the patients are referred with macular dystrophy, there may be nonhereditary cases. Second, additional regions studied by WES or the entire ABCA4gene have been screened in restudied cases, representing the 2% and 32% of the total of characterized restudied cases, respectively. In 20 of these patients (8% of total restudied cases), we found pathogenic variants in genes not included in the clinical exome TTLL5 caseordeepintronicvariantsinthe ABCA4gene. However, theremainingpatientscharacterizedaftertherestudyshould have been solved if they had been sequenced by clinical exome as first approach. For all these reasons, theGenetic Landscape of Inherited Macular Dystrophies IOVS | February  | Vol. 63 | No. 2 | Article 11 | 7 characterization rate obtained in this study is specific for each cohort and cannot be compared. Three-quarters of patients referred with STGD diagnosis were biallelic for the ABCA4gene, which is expected because Stargardt disease is due to mutations in this gene (STGD1).16The ABCA4gene was also the most frequent gene mutated in CCRD and otherMD groups, representing 38% and 14% of the total of studied patients, respectively. It is well known that there are missing alleles in the ABCA4 gene in unsolved patients with one pathogenic allele.16The fact that the monoallelic cases for the ABCA4 gene were only significantly reduced in the group of STGD diagnosissupportsthenecessityofsequencingthecomplete ABCA4gene in those cases with a clear diagnosis of Stargardt disease to find a second pathogenic variant. In most cases,whenall50codingexonshavebeenalreadyscreened, this is likely located in deep-intronic regions22or regulatory regions.21At the end of our study, the frequency of monoallelic ABCA4patients found in all groups of clinical diagnosis is between 3% to 6%. Pathogenic noncoding variants still could not be discarded in 54% of the total of monoallelic ABCA4patients in which the complete sequencing of the ABCA4locus has not been performed, including nine STGD patients, six of whom were unsuccessfully screened for the prevalent Spanish intronic variants. However,it is important toremarkthatonly1.6%ofthemutatedallelesinthe ABCA4 gene are deep intronic pathogenic variants, as we described before.35Nevertheless, our hypothesis is that most of these patients, specially CCRD and otherMD patients, could be merelycarriersofavariantinthemostfrequentIRDmutated gene,43as is also supported by previous studies reflecting a carrier rate of 6% for ABCA4in Spanish population.28 Other genes different from ABCA4known to cause other MD or IRD were identified in the group of suspected STGD cases. Mutationsin PRPH2havebeenassociated withSTGDlike phenotypes,16but with an AD-inheritance pattern. This fact could be explained by the limited clinical information from relatives together with the reported incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in this gene.44Other genes associated to specific IRD-phenotypes with clinical features other than STGD were found in patients in whom no clinical information apart from their referred STGD diagnosis was available. Mutations in IRD-genes causing phenotypes different from STGD have also been reported when studying a priori STGD cases.45Genes associated to RP,LCA,optic atrophy, retinoschisis and Best disease were found in the groups of CCRD and otherMD. This reflects that the clinical entity can be accurately defined when sequencing a large number of IRD-associated genes, as has been addressed before.42The ideal scenario in those cases would be to collect ophthalmological information after the genetic study to provide a complete clinical reclassification. Moreover, in unsolved cases with a specific diagnosis, as the case of STGD patients,additional clinical examinations might reveal initial misdiagnosis, when both imaging technologies and the knowledge on retinal diseases was not as advanced as currently. Remarkably,we identified a homozygous novel variant in the gene PLA2G5 in two unrelated probands with STGD-like phenotype. This gene was first associated with benign fleck retina,46a condition that was added to the classification of the fleck disorders described by Krill and Folk,47and where patients have no functional defect.48Sergouniotis et al.46 identified seven patients with yellow-white retinal lesions and no visual deficits carrying PLA2G5 mutations. No otherpatients have been reported to date to our knowledge, with ourtwopatientsbeingtheeighthandninthcaseswithmutations in this very rare gene. Our patients presented a fleck retina disorder involving the macula and different from the benign condition because they are symptomatic and have a mild functional dysfunction of vision. This may suggest that PLA2G5 gene could also been involved in retinal degeneration with functional disturbances on vision. The novel variant identified in the last exon of this gene leads to the truncation of the protein group V phospholipase A 2(PLA2G5) at amino acid 103, located before the aspartic acid amino acid at 111 position that is responsible for catalytic activity of the protein.49 The high-throughput genetic analysis by NGS could be successful, although the family history was ambiguous or the clinical manifestation was atypical.42On the one hand, most of the patients included in this work were sporadic cases in which apparently the proband had not affected relatives, and, in few cases, there is no available information of the family members. As expected,95% of these cases were confirmed to have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance after the identification of the mutated gene, and in 52% of them it was confirmed that each mutated allele was received from one progenitor. However, when variants in AD- or XL-associated genes were identified, as in the remaining5% of patients,having clinical information of relatives and segregation studies are important to give accurate genetic counseling. Finally,only 35% of the total ar/sMD patients were genetically unsolved; however, NGS screening has not been yet performed in a quarter. An extended analysis of noncoding and regulatory regions together with functional assays, and the identification of new genes causing IRD would be needed to characterize unsolved cases. Also, structural variants affecting genomic domains may be involved.50 This study provides a genetic landscape of 1036 ar/sMD families,giving a mutational spectrum of the genes involved in STGD, CCRD, and otherMD groups of patients according to their suspected diagnosis. We demonstrate the increase of the characterization diagnostic yield after the implementation of the exome sequencing even when no clinical and familiar data are available. Also, a new phenotypic association with a visual defect is described for the rare gene PLA2G5.

One approach investigated for this purpose is that of optogenetics, a method of neuromodulation that utilises light to activate neurons engineered to ectopically express a light-sensitive protein.

Email: Abstract  legend . Optogenetic approaches for vision restoration in end-stage retinal degeneration. In inherited retinal degenerations, there is progressive loss of photoreceptors (rods and cones) but inner retinal structures remain largely intact. Optogenetic strategies aim to induce light sensitivity in remaining retinal cells using gene therapy, via ectopic expression of an opsin gene. The most widely investigated approach uses retinal transduction via an adeno-associated virus injected either into the subretinal space or via intravitreal injection, with the aim of vision restoration(GC,ganglioncell;BC,bipolarcell;AC,amacrinecell;HC,horizontalcell;RC,residualcones;RPE,retinal pigmentepithelium). The inherited retinal degenerations are a heterogeneous group of disorders that result in photoreceptor cell dysfunction and cell death, leading to severe visual impairment. They affect around one in 4000 people and, with rare exceptions, there are no effective therapies (Verbakeletal.,).Theymaybeinheritedasanautosomaldominant,autosomalrecessiveorX-linkedtraitand somerareformsareassociatedwithmutationsinmDNA. Although most of these diseases are confined to the eye, some are associated with systemic features, when the causativegeneisexpressedinseveraldifferentextraocular tissues.

Many different approaches have been tried, including the use of gene targeted therapies,neuroprotectiveagents,optogenetics,celltransplantation, stem cell therapy and retinal implants (, ). Gene targeted therapies rely on a precise moleculargeneticdiagnosisandgenerallywillbeeffective only for the gene of interest, with some approaches utilizing CRISPR or antisense oligonucleotides targeting only a specific mutation (, ). For muchallelicheterogeneity,suchtargetedapproacheshaveseriouslimitations. Furthermore,gene-basedtherapiesare probably effective early in the disease when significant probably less effective in advanced disease when there is extensive photoreceptor cell death or photoreceptor structure has been lost.

Evidence from animal models (, ) and human post-mortem specimens (, ; , ) indicates relative preservation of inner retinal structures and circuitry even in advanced stages of inherited retinal degeneration. Several gene agnostic approaches have been investigated for the purpose of vision restoration, including cell transplantation, stem cell therapy, retinal implants and optogenetics. Each has reached the stage of clinical trials after extensive preclinical studies. Cell transplantation and stem cell therapy aim to support residual viable photoreceptors and develop new populations of light sensitive cells. By contrast, optogenetic approaches and retinal implants bypass host photoreceptors to stimulate remaining inner retinal neurons and post-receptoral pathways. The latter comprise arrays of electrodes or photodiodes that are   The Authors. The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.

This symposium reviewwillfocusonattemptstouseoptogeneticstorestore sightinlate-stageretinaldegenerations. Optogenetics is a method of neuromodulation that has wide applicability in neuroscience. It involves the use of lighttoactivateapopulationofcellsmadephotosensitive via ectopic expression of an opsin protein (, ). The first reports utilised the expression of a combinationof Drosophila photoreceptorgenestoinduce lightsensitivityinmammalianneurones(Zemelmanetal., ) and several other optogenetic tools have subsequently been developed. Given that the conversion of light to electrical activity occurs in the eye when light triggersphototransductioninrodsandcones,anintuitive application of optogenetic techniques is to induce light sensitivityintheremaininginnerretinalcellsinend-stage an effective optogenetic approach requires consideration of multiple factors, including the characteristics of the light-sensitive protein used, the vector for gene delivery andthetargetcellforexpression. opsins,aswellaschimericandengineeredproteins. These vary in their sensitivity to light, wavelength of light ca usingpeakstim ula tio n,r espo nsekineticsa ndpo ten tial into ion channels or ion pumps and G-protein coupled receptors. The use of light-gated ion channels or pumps is because these do not require the presence of proteins involved in a signalling cascade that may be absent, or reduced, in advanced retinal degeneration. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a rhodopsin with a microbial-type chromophore that was originally isolated from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (, ; , ). ChR2 is itself a light-sensitive cation channel: incident light isomerises itsall-transchromophore into 13- cisretinal inducing a conformational change in ChR2, allowing cations intothecellleadingtodepolarisation(Nageletal.,).This responseisrapidwithanonsetoflessthan50 safterlight exposure(Hollandetal.,),makingChR2well-suited for use as an optogenetic tool. ChR2 responds to light of wavelength under 540 nm, with a peak sensitivity of 450 nm (, ), which is in the blue light spectrum. A disadvantage of ChR2 is the high stimulus intensity required to obtain a response compared to rhodopsin or coneopsins(1015photonscm2s1required forChR2 vs. 1010photonscm2s1forconesand106photonscm2s1 forrods) (, ; , )and this high intensity of blue light may be damaging to the retina. Another potential limitation is range: healthy photoreceptors are able to respond to light intensities spanning 8logunits,whereasChR2responsesareseenovera2log unitrange(Lagalietal.,).Therefore,animageorlight processingdevicemayberequiredtoamplifydimlight,or attenuateveryhighintensitylightforoptimalstimulation ofChR2. Given these limitations, engineered variants of ChR channelrhodopsin(orCatCh),whichhasimprovedlight sensitivityandkineticscomparedtoChR(Kleinlogeletal., ).Othernative(e.g. ChrimsonR)andengineeredChR (e.g. red-light activated depolarizing ChR or ReaChR) have peak sensitivity in the red light spectrum, and high lightintensitiesofthesewavelengthsmaybelessdamaging to the retina than similar intensities of blue light. Studies have also explored the use of an engineered light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR). This bears a mutated cysteine residue, to which a photo switchable tethered ligand can bind. Incident light of 380 nm causes isomerisation of the photo switch and opening of the ion channel,and500nmlightresultsinclosingofthechannel. Expression of this optogenetic tool in murine degenerate retinaresultedinrestorationofvisualresponses(, ) and a second-generation ligand activated at 460 nm has also shown similar efficacy in mice and dogs (Gaubetal.,). Halorhodopsin (NpHR) is a light-sensitive chloride halobacteria (, ). Light stimulation of NpHR causes hyperpolarisation of the cell (similar to the response of photoreceptors in the physiological state) and its peak sensitivity is to a wavelength of 590 nm. Given its very fast activation and de-activation kinetics (Han & Boyden, ), halorhodopsin has good temporal characteristics for therapeutic use. An enhanced variant (eNpHR) has also been developed that permitshigherexpressionlevelswithoutinducingtoxicity   The Authors. The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.4626 S. R. De Silva and A. T. Moore J Physiol 600.21 (, ). However, the stimulus intensity required to obtain a light response is even higher than that for ChR2 (1016photons cm2s1) (, ). Other ion pumps have also been investigated such as the yellowgreen light sensitive proton pump archaerhodopsin or Arch (, ), activation ofwhichleadstoneuronalsilencing. AfurthertoolisJaws, a red shifted cruxhalorhodopsin, which showed greater light sensitivity and ganglion cell spiking compared to other hyperpolarising ion pumps following expression in residual cone photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinal degeneration(Chuongetal.,). G-protein coupled receptors Rhodopsin and cone opsins are found natively in rod of each leads to cell hyperpolarisation. They are G-protein coupled, and this has the significant advantage of permitting signal amplification. For example, a single activated rhodopsin interacts with more than 800 molecules of its G-protein transducin, resulting in the closure of more than 200 ion channels in the photoreceptor outer segment disc membrane, from the absorptionofonephotonalone(Purvesetal.,).This signalamplificationmeansthatG-proteincoupledopsins are sensitive to lower light intensities than ion channels, and therefore could function as optogenetic tools (, ; Cehajic-, ) without the need for modification of the light stimulus required by ChR2 and NpHR. In addition, ectopic expression of these native proteins has a lower probability of incurringan immune response when injected into the eye than microbialopsins. A further mammalian opsin, melanopsin, has also been investigated, which is present in a subset of ganglion cells. Melanopsin is also G-protein coupled and photoisomerisation of 11- cisretinal results in activation downstream signalling cascade causing cell depolarisation, with responses in the physiological light range (, ; , ).

The rationale here is that the mixed visual signal is interpreted via cortical processing, as is presumed to b et h ec a s ew i t hr e t i n a li m p l a n t st h a th a v ea l s os h o w n efficacy despite stimulating multiple retinal cell types (Millsetal.,). However, widespread expression of a light sensitive protein in remaining retinal cells runs the potential risk ofalossofsignalprocessing,limitingthequalityofvision thatcouldberestored. Humanretinalcircuitryiscomplex: cones synapse with 10 types of bipolar cell (ON and OFF subtypes) and rods with one (ON subtype, the most commonbipolarcelltypeintheretina).Thismultiplicity creationofONandOFFpathways,wherealightstimulus excites one population of cells and inhibits another. Theseconnectionsarefurthermodifiedbyhorizontalcells to mediate contrast sensitivity. Cone ON bipolar cells synapse with ON ganglion cells, and OFF bipolar cells synapse with OFF ganglion cells, respectively. Rod ON bipolar cells synapse with amacrine cells, which in turn provide inhibitory input to OFF ganglion cells. There are ganglioncellintheprimateretina,withvaryingfunctions that facilitate our complex visual responses (Grunert & Martin,). Some optogenetic strategies therefore aim to preserve as much signal processing as possible within the retina, by targeting the most upstream remaining cells (e.g. bipolar cells or residual cones) to more closely mimic the retinal circuitry that is normally stimulated by light. In vivostudies using murine models of retinal degeneration have demonstrated successful targeting of eNpHR to hyperpololarise residual cones (, ) and ChR2 to depolarise ON bipolar cells (, ; , ). However, hyperpolarising opsins (e.g. rhodopsin) have been also been selectively expressed in ON bipolar cells in mouse models with restoration of visual responses (Cehajic-, ). Precisely how the visual signal would be interpreted in the latter situation is unclear, given reversal of polarity, although there is evidence to suggest that visual responses were mediated via light-dependent disinhibition of ganglion cell firing (Cehajic-, ). Alternative strategies specifically target the ganglion cell (, ; , ) because this cell type is preserved even in end-stage disease, but again compromise theretina. Delivery of optogenetic agents to the retina of the opsin protein to cells of the degenerate retina is via gene therapy vectors such as adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV). These vectors have been used in human gene supplementation therapy clinical trials and therapy named voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), for an early-onset, severe retinal degeneration (as a result of biallelicvariantsin RPE65)(Maguireetal.,).AAVare single-strandedDNAparvovirusesthatarenotassociated with pathogenicity in humans, and have a genome of 4.7 kb consisting of two genes on either side of which lies a palindromic region known as an inverted terminal repeat (ITR). These native genes can be replaced with a transgeneofinterestandregulatoryelements,suchasthe coding sequence of an opsin gene. A limitation of AAV gene therapy is the size of genetic material than can be packaged within the AAV capsid, which is under 5 kb. However, given that opsin genes are comparatively small, this limited packaging capacity does not significantly impactoptogeneticgenetherapyapproaches. efficacyofexpressionandtargetcelltypebymodifyingits capsid and promoter sequence amongst other elements. (, ), of which AAV2, AAV3 and AAV5 are endemic to humans (, ). To increase transduction efficiency and change cellular tropism, vectors have been pseudotyped in which the ITRs of one serotype are packaged in the capsid of another serotype (, ). For example, packaging AAV2 ITRs in an AAV8 capsid (generating a rAAV2/8 vector) confers the safety and efficient expression of rAAV2 with thetropismofAAV8.rAAV2/2andrAAV2/8arebothable totransduceganglioncellsfollowingintravitrealinjection, and rAAV2/2, rAAV2/5 and rAAV2/8 are able to transducephotoreceptors(Lebherzetal.,). Bipolar cells have been particularly difficult to target using AAV vectors, possibly as a result of viral particles being degraded within the retina before they access this layer. Modification of the capsid VP3 protein, specifically point mutation of tyrosine (Y) residues to phenylalanine (F), can significantly improve the ability of AAV to penetrate the retina and increase transgene expression (, ). A single mutation in rAAV2/8(Y733F) was demonstrated to result in bipolar celltransductioninthe rd10(Doroudchietal.,)and rd1mouse model of retinal degeneration (, ) and the rAAV2/2 quadruple and pentuple mutants are able to transduce bipolar cells when delivered either subretinallyorintravitreallyinwild-typemice(Petrs-, ).

Subretinal the operating theatre and requires intraocular surgery to remove the vitreous (vitrectomy), as well as penetration of the retina using a fine gauge needle followed by subretinal injection of the virus. There are associated small risks of retinal detachment, bleeding, infection (endophthalmitis), inflammation, raised intraocular pressure and developing cataract; however, this method allows for concentrated vector delivery to an area directly adjacent to the residual outer retina, and is the method of Luxturna(Maguire etal.,).Intravitrealinjectionisa commonly performed procedure in clinical care and can be performed in a suitable room in a clinical setting. It involves direct injection through the sclera at the pars plana, with subsequent injection of the drug into the vitreous cavity. However, dilution of virions within the vitreouscavitymayreducetransduction. More recently, a directed evolution approach has been utilised to generate new AAV variants, by screening a library of capsid types generated in the laboratory and isolating the best AAV candidate. Using this approach, an AAV vector named 7m8 was identified that enabled transductionofphotoreceptors(Dalkaraetal.,)and bipolar cells (, ) following intravitreal delivery in mouse retina, with transduction of primate retina also being demonstrated in the former study. However, compared with intravitreal vector delivery in mouse models where widespread retinal transduction is often seen, a much smaller area of retina seems to be transduced in primates, largely in the parafoveal region (, ; , ). This reduction is presumed to be the result of a thicker inner limiting membrane in primates forming a greater barrier to virus particles than in the murine retina. Novel AAV vectors (, ; , ), although this is stillnotaswidespreadasinmousemodels. Alongside modification of the AAV capsid protein, alterationofthepromotercanenabletargetingofdifferent cell populations. Many studies have used ubiquitous promoters to express the light sensitive protein in a wide range of retinal cells. An example of this is the CAG promoter [comprising a cytomegalovirus enhancer (C), chicken beta actin promoter (A) and splice acceptor of the rabbit beta globin gene (G)], which has been demonstrated to facilitate effective transduction of the degenerate retina (, ;, ; , ). Subsequently,cell-specificpromoterssuchas Grm6-SV40 (the glutamate receptor associated with ON bipolar cells) have successfully targeted expression to ON bipolar cells (Cehajic-, ; , ; , ). The combination of this promoter transduction (, ) and modifications of the Grm6-SV40 promoter have also been investigated, either using multiple repeats or additional intronic sequences (Croninetal.,).Ganglioncellspecificpromoterssuch as thesynapsin-1 promoter (, ; Sengupta etal.,)havebeenusedtoeffectivelytargetexpression inthesecelltypes. approaches for vision restoration has led to at least four ongoing clinical trials in this area (https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=optogenetic&cntry= &state=&city=&dist=). The patients most suitable for thesetherapiesarethosewithadvancedvisualloss(visual acuity of hand movements or perception of light only) but with relatively intact inner retinal structures on optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans (Fig. 2). safety and tolerability, and secondary outcome measures include assessment of visual function such as perception of light, visual acuity, full field threshold stimulus test, determiningdirectionofmotion,identificationofobjects, evaluationofmobilityandqualityoflife. The first trial was led by RetroSense Therapeutics, now a part of Allergan, which began recruitment in  (NCT02556736), investigating intravitreal delivery of ChR2 using an AAV2 vector in 14 patients.

Optogenetic therapies are one of several approaches in clinical trials for restoration of visual responses in advanced retinal degeneration.

Patients affected with inherited retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and choroideremia (CHM) often experience gradual loss of night vision and may also develop tunnel vision [ 1,2]. Others, with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), may be born with or experience the early onset of vision loss [ 3]. Patients with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) are commonly observed to present early-onset macular degeneration, loss in visual acuity and the splitting of retinal layers [ 4]. The irreversible progress of visual impairment and lack of effective treatments highlight the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Due to the immune-privileged characteristics of eyes and the continuous identification of causative genes, gene therapy may hold great promises for treating IRDs. This review provides an overview of retinal gene therapy development by summarizing significant contributions and important clinical trials to date (Table 1).Int. J. Mol.

Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 5 of 24 2. Current Developments in Retinal Gene Therapy 2.1. Technological Breakthrough Advances in the identification of causative genes inextricably propel the progress in retinal gene therapy. The identification of crucial driver genes of disease onset/progression provides significant insights into the disease mechanisms and creates the possibility of targeting these genes therapeutically. The delineation of specific underlying genomic and genetic factors in molecular diagnosis establishes the basis for gene augmentation and editing therapeutic designs. Currently, researchers have identified 260 driver genes for IRDs [ 18]. Recent advances in manipulating genetic material and the accumulation of several tools to tailor genetic elements gave gene therapy momentum as a promising upcoming field. 2.2. Retina, the Ideal Playground for Gene Therapy A nonrenewable part of the central nervous system, the retina, is a desirable target for gene therapy due to the complex innate visual signal transmission that modernized tools cannot restore. Moreover, the eyes unique nature promotes the appropriateness and advantages of gene therapy application for retinal diseases [ 19], which foster intense exploration and innovation. The retinal cells do not reproduce after birth; therefore, a single dose of the vector can ensure long-term expression of the transgene [ 20]. Furthermore, the eye is naturally small and easily approachable with intravitreal and subretinal injections. Its small volume allows low quantities of vectors or cells to reach the optimal concentration. Since the ocular compartment is isolated, significant extraocular leakage is rare, which lessens the risks and complexities. The bloodretina barrier assures the immune privilege status, making foreign antigens and viral vector exposure tolerable; additionally, the barrier also provides the antigen-specific inhibition of both cellular and humoral immune responses . 2.3. Gene Delivery Systems Despite the continuous discovery of novel IRD driver genes, the translation of virusmediated gene delivery into the clinic faces several hurdles. Due to the very nature of gene delivery with integrating vectors, translation/application/viability of gene therapy was limited by constitutive/ inherent elicitation of the immune response, insertional mutagenesis, viral tropism, off-target activity and undesired/high profile adverse clinical events [ 22,23]. Despite being a potentially powerful tool for correcting a disease at the genetic level, the inability to accomplish controlled manipulation and safe transgene insertion limited real-life applications of gene therapy. Therefore, the identification of safe and convenient vectors to address these concerns was critical in gene therapy advancement. Currently, gene therapy has diverged into virus-mediated and physical mechanism-based (including application of nanomaterials) gene delivery approaches. Viral vectors are primarily represented by adenovirus (AV), lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV). As adenovirus vectors are immunogenic and lentivirus vectors integrate into the genome, AAV vectors are the most preferred choice for practical use. Integration into the genome may be influenced by the local chromatin structure at the targeted genome site and affect the transgene and native neighboring genes expression. Wild type AAVs are replicationincompetent viruses that require helper AVs to enter the lytic cycle, moreover, Rep protein supplied in trans eliminates the ability of genomic integration. The recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) genome is processed into a double-stranded circular episome that is maintained extrachromosomally. The chromatin-like structure of the AAV vector genome elicits no negative effects to host cells and enables long-term transgene expression in non-dividing cells [ 24]. The property of cell-selective targeting based on a serotype and low immunogenicity made AAVs a real workhorse of gene therapy [ 19]. Furthermore, pseudotyping, a process of creating virus hybrids, is now used to further exploit/refine the tropism and transduction efficiency of each serotype [2527].Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 6 of 24 3. Leber Congenital Amaurosis 3.1. Clinical Characteristics and Genetics Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a rare IRD with a worldwide prevalence of 1/30,000 to 1/81,000 of newborn babies, which accounts for 5% of all IRDs [ 28]. LCA patients may often experience profound vision loss, pendular nystagmus and severe retinal degeneration in infancy or early childhood. LCA comprises a genetically heterogeneous group of mainly autosomal-recessive retinopathies beginning in infancy and childhood, with at least 21 mutated genes and over 400 mutations identified to date [ 29]. These genes regulate such processes as intraphotoreceptor ciliary transport ( CEP290, IQCB1, LCA5, RPGRIP1, SPATA7, TULP1, IFT140 ), photoreceptor morphogenesis ( CRB1, CRX, GDF6, CLUAP1, PRPH2 ), phototransduction (AIPL1, GUCY2D, RD3 ), retinoid cycle ( LRAT, RDH12, RPE65 ), signal transduction ( CABP4, KCNJ13 ), retinal differentiation ( OTX2 ), guanine synthesis ( IMPDH1 ), outer segment phagocytosis ( MERTK ), coenzyme NAD biosynthesis ( NMNAT1 ), subcomponent of a chaperon complex ( CCT2 ) or other protein unknown function ( DTHD1 ) [29,30]. Due to the wide range of genotypic variability, the clinical phenotypes in carriers of LCA mutations are also highly heterogeneous. Variable ophthalmic disorders range from essentially normal to those characterized by refractive errors, photoaversion, nyctalopia, oculodigital reflex, peripheral chorioretinal atrophy, intraretinal pigment migration, drusen-like deposits, keratoconus and cataracts. Some LCA cases even show neurologic, intellectual, or psychomotor developmental delays [ 3135]. In total, there are 18 recognized types of LCA, among them, LCA type 2 (LCA2) is caused by the mutation in the RPE65 gene on chromosome 1p31. Mutations in this gene also cause retinitis pigmentosa. On the other hand, LCA10 is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene on chromosome 12q21. Both homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of these genes were found to cause LCA2 and LCA10 . 3.2. Disease Mechanisms: Interdependence of Photoreceptors and RPE The end stages of IRDs are generally characterized by irreversible progressive thinning of the retina with the loss of RPE and neurosensory retinal cells that lead to severe visual dysfunction or total blindness. Severe perturbation of gross retinal structure mainly involves the retinas thinning upon photoreceptor cell death [ 37]. Moreover, IRDs also cause structural changes, such as rosette-like structure formation in retinitis pigmentosa [ 38] and the physical separation of cells at the outer plexiform layer in retinoschisis . The pathophysiological mechanisms of LCA are related to the disruption of phototransduction and visual cycle and affect the complex homeostatic interplay between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. RPE underlies the retina and serves as an immune-privileged structure that separates the photoreceptor layer and choroidal vasculature. Therefore, the role of RPE as a physical barrier is in maintaining photoreceptor viability by providing nutrients from the choroidal blood supply and transporting away waste products from the photoreceptors [ 39]. Photoreceptors are specialized neurons containing the outer segments (OS) composed of stacked membranous disc carrying phototransduction proteins, opsins, which are responsible for converting captured light to electric signals. RPE phagocytoses 10% of OS discs daily and renews a complete OS in 1015 days . The visual cycles physiology depends on the photoreceptors integrity and functions, as well as on the supporting RPE cells. Therefore, immune-mediated and oxidative stress-mediated RPE damage and malfunction may lead to atrophic age-related macular degeneration with progressive loss of photoreceptors and choroid instability. RPE degeneration induced by the mutations affecting photoreceptor OS in Stargardts macular dystrophy emphasizes the interdependence between these two retinal layers in maintaining their structural integrity .Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 7 of 24 3.3. Visual Cycle and the Role of RPE65 The visual cycle is initiated by the light activation of visual pigment opsin in the photoreceptor cells (Figure 1). Opsins are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that contain the covalently attached cofactor, 11-cis-retinal. The single photon of light results in the conversion of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, which leads to a change in the conformation of the opsins protein moiety. The latter triggers a signal transduction cascade resulting in the closure of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels, which changes the membrane potential, generating nerve impulses that are transduced to the central nervous system to generate vision. On the other hand, all-trans-retinal is reduced into all-trans-retinol and diffuses into adjacent RPE through the interphotoreceptor matrix. The transfer of all-trans-retinol into RPE is mediated by the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). In RPE cells, all-trans-retinol is esterified into all-trans-retinyl esters by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). All-trans-retinyl esters are converted to 11-cis-retinol by RPE65, followed by the oxidization of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. This 11-cis-retinal then diffuses back to the OS of photoreceptor cells, where it is recombined with the opsin polypeptide to form photoactive pigment to complete the cycle [4143]. Figure 1. Outline of retinoid metabolism in the visual cycle. The activation of opsin by light triggers a series of conversions starting from 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal. The cycle is completed by recombination of 11-cis-retinal with opsin protein to form the photoactive pigment. IRBP: interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein; LRAT: lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RPE65: Retinal pigmented epithelium-specific protein with molecular mass 65 kDa. RPE65 is a 65-kD protein specifically expressed in the RPE, which possesses isomerohydrolase enzymatic activity that is required to regenerate 11-cis-retinal [ 38,44,45]. The RPE65 gene contains fourteen coding exons spanning 20 kb. In contrast to other genes whose defects also play a contributing role in degenerative retinopathies, RPE65 is among the genes expressed exclusively in the RPE [ 44,45].RPE65 mutations interrupt the regular retinoid cycle, resulting in the absence of light-sensitive visual pigment in photoreceptors and blindness. 4. Preclinical Studies of the RPE65 Gene Therapy of LCA The ultimate goal of preclinical efforts is to achieve gene delivery to a group of heterogeneous patients who may present with different LCA onset and retinal degenerationInt. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 8 of 24 status. The non-degenerated retina is defined as one that suffers from metabolic dysfunction only, whereby the interrupted retinoid cycle may be restored by the wild type RPE65 gene replacement. In contrast, the degenerated retina is characterized by the loss of photoreceptors that may benefit more from visual prosthetics or stem cell therapeutics. The role of RPE65 mutations in the etiology of LCA was first identified in  [ 45]. The dog model of RPE65 -mutated LCA was established in  [ 46], and was used for preclinical studies in  [ 47]. The first clinical trial in humans was carried out in  [ 5,48]. In a  follow-up study, researchers identified the presence of AAV particles in primates from the study initiated six years ago, in , raising safety issues and immunological concerns [ 49]. Together, these studies highlighted the need to identify possible roadblocks to clinical translation for the benefit of other gene therapies targeting retinal degeneration [ 50]. A roadmap of preclinical studies towards the success of RPE65-based gene therapy is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Preclinical milestones of establishing the RPE65 -based gene therapy. Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 9 of 24 5. Therapeutic Strategies and Clinical Milestones for LCA Based on the establishments preclinical studies had achieved in gene augmentation therapy, clinical applications of various gene therapy strategies were carried out intercontinentally in the US along with University of London, Nantes University Hospital in France and Hadassah Medical Organization in Israel. Besides gene augmentation therapy that helps restore RPE65 by supplementing unmutated gene segments, other therapeutic strategies such as RNA-based antisense oligonucleotide therapy that reduce aberrant splicing and increase wildtype CEP290 production, 11-cis retinal therapy and gene editing therapy are as well in the run towards clinical feasibility (Table 2). 5.1. Gene Augmentation Therapy Since the first identification of the RPE65 gene, researchers have successfully demonstrated safety and proof-of-principle studies using recombinant-AAV in LCA2 murine and canine models. These initial animal model studies encouraged further research in applying gene augmentation therapy in the human retina, which eventually led to human clinical trial approval [ 51]. Clinical trials by various groups began in , including Spark Therapeutics in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania testing their AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector, Applied Genetic Technology in collaboration with the University of Florida testing rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 and the NHS foundation trust in collaboration with the University of London testing rAAV2/2.hRPE65p.hRPE65. Moreover, by , all three groups confirmed that the vector delivery was safe, and no adverse events were reported [ 5,48,52]. In , a clinical phase I/II trial for the treatment of LCA2 patients started in France [ 53]. A schematic graph of how gene augmentation drug exerts it therapeutic effect is shown in Figure 3.Int. J.

( b) Schematic of the retina structure showing the topology of retinal cell types. ( c) The most well-established types of gene therapy of LCA include gene augmentation therapy (Luxturna), gene editing therapy (EDIT-101) and RNA antisense nucleotide-based therapy (QR-110). Top panel: gene editing therapy based on AAV-mediated subretinal delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 system that results in excision of intronic IVS26 mutation in the photoreceptor CEP290 gene that causes abnormal splicing and termination of translation due to introduced cryptic exon. Middle panel: therapy based on intravitreal delivery of RNA antisense oligonucleotides targeting intronic mutation if CEP290 gene that causes abnormal splicing. Oligonucleotides act at RNA level directing normal splicing of mutated pre-mRNAs. Bottom panel: gene augmentation aimed to correct the effect of the mutated RPE65 in RPE is based on the delivery of the wild type RPE65 gene by AAV vector to the subretinal area. Thus, normal RPE65 protein is partially restored, resulting in vision function improvement. Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 12 of 24 5.1.1. Voretigene Neparvovec-Rzyl (Luxturna) In , Spark Therapeutics started the phase I trial of AAV2-hRPE65v2-based voretigene neparvovec-rzyl medication. Three months follow up showed that three patients with LCA2 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with modest improvement in retinal function measured by subjective visual acuity tests. Although one patient developed an asymptomatic macular hole, which is an adverse event, the retinal function was nevertheless restored [ 48]. One year follow up showed that all patients exhibited a sustained improvement in measurements such as dark adaptometry, pupillometry, electroretinography, nystagmus and ambulatory behavior. A subgroup of children who gained ambulatory vision showed the most significant vision improvement . Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl entered phase I/II in . Consistently with the phase I trial, both safety and efficacy profile endpoints met expectations for at least 1.5 years. Furthermore, the subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2 was performed in three subjects, and the retinal function measurements persisted from 1 month to 1.5 years postinjection time points. The safety profile elicited no severe adverse events, although a transient rise in anti-AAV capsid antibodies in several patients was observed. The trial resulted in continuous function amelioration by showing improvements in velocity and amplitude of PLR, light sensitivity and reduction in nystagmus. The positive results in both safety and efficacy measurements further supported the usability of AAV-mediated gene augmentation therapy in treating RPE65 -associated LCA . In , voretigene neparvovec-rzyl entered phase III and began to be administered into the contralateral eye. Previous exposure to the viral antigens may have prompted an immune response that could compromise the effect of the second administration. Concerned with safety, the team readministered the vector to the second eye of three adults at 1.7 to 3.3 years after the initial subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2. After six months, the evaluation of clinical examinations and immunological responses indicated the safety of interventions. In addition, the subjects showed improvements in visual/retinal function and cortical activation after the readministration of gene therapy [ 55]. AAV2-hRPE65v2 gene therapy successfully improved mean mobility and full-field light sensitivity after administration to the contralateral eye. To summarize, the evaluation of safety, immune response, retinal and visual functions and activation of the visual cortex, all supported the usability of AAV2-hRPE65v2 for gene augmentation therapy in RPE65 -associated LCA [ 56]. Maximum visual and retinal function improvements were observed at 6 months posttreatment, and the improvement increased persistently throughout the trial [ 57]. Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl gene augmentation was shown to improve the visual function in RPE65 - mediated LCA, with only two intervention participants having shown severe adverse events unrelated to the treatment, with other adverse events being mild [ 8]. The drug entered the final phase of clinical trials in  with the observation phase. The completion of phase III trials made voretigene neparvovec-rzyl the first FDA-approved gene therapy for a genetic disease now sold under the commercial name Luxturna. 5.1.2. tgAAG76 In , University College London (UCL) in collaboration with Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust initiated a phase I/II trial to test their product, rAAV2/2.hRPE65p. hRPE65 (tgAAG76). The result demonstrated that three young adult patients receiving subretinal injections developed no serious adverse effects. The evaluation revealed that tgAAG76 delivery did not result in any significant changes in retinal functions assessed by objective measurements. However, one patient significantly improved visual mobility and visual function on microperimetry and dark-adapted perimetry. One of the participants showed increased sensitivity to light and improved in an obstacle course under dim light. In summary, only very modest and temporary improvements in retinal sensitivity were observed rather than robust and durable therapeutic effects . In , the UCL team modified the rAAV2/2 vector to enhance RPE65 production efficiency without exceeding the tolerated vector dose to tackle the problem of possibleInt. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 13 of 24 intraocular inflammation. The modified vector, named AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65, contained an optimized promoter sequence, exogenous intron, optimized Kozak sequence, as well as codon optimization of the RPE65 sequence. The AAV2/5 vector was used due to its superior gene delivery effectiveness to human RPE cells than the AAV2/2 vector [ 58]. The UCL team then successfully carried this modified vector into phase I/II in . 5.1.3. rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 The phase I trial of the University of Floridas rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 began in , whereby three young adults aged 21-24 years were recruited and received uniocular subretinal injections. Follow up lasted for 90 days, and the therapy passed safety requirements since no severe adverse events or systemic toxicity were detected. The participants showed limited visual acuity improvement, yet they all reported that the treated eye had better visual sensitivity than the contralateral eye, especially under dim light . The measurements at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year time points indicated that rAAV2-CBSB-hRPE65 augmentation did not elicit vector-related serious adverse events, and those significant improvements in visual sensitivity reported at the 3 month-time point extended to 12 months. The safety and efficacy of rAAV2-RPE65 gene therapy could last at least one year posttreatment [ 59]. There was no systemic toxicity reported for safety concerns, while ocular adverse events were due to surgery [ 60]. Until , the clinical trials indicated that visual gain was detectable within the first month and efficacy could persist for at least three years. Longer follow-up observations found that although the treated eyes improved vision persisted, there was progressive photoreceptor degeneration which caused a diminution of visual sensitivity . 5.1.4. rAAV2/4-hRPE65 rAAV2/4-hRPE65 underwent a phase 1/2 trial in  conducted by the University of Nantes, and the results were reported in . All patients showed good immune tolerance to the vector with improved visual acuity, visual field and cortical activations along visual pathways [ 10]. In this study, patients were segregated into cohorts based on the age and dose of the viral vector injected.  identified that, compared with previous clinical trials of other vectors, the dosage designed for the rAAV2/4 vector (1.221010vgto 4.81010vg) was lower than that for vectors from other studies (ranging from 1.51010vgto 6.111011vg), indicative that in haplodeficient diseases, the designed dosage may have been insufficient to restore enough functional protein to slow down the degeneration process and improve visual function. 5.2. 11-Cis-Retinal Replacement: QLT091001 QLT091001, a synthetic 9-cis-retinyl acetate, is an oral drug that serves as a replacement for the missing 11-cis-retinal, which combines with opsin to form its photoactive form required for the phototransduction cascade. The chromophore reaches the retina in a noninvasive manner and can be withdrawn if necessary. It enables bypassing through the block of the retinoid cycle and helps to preserve the morphology of the retina. The administration of QLT091001 was shown to improve visual function as measured by Goldmann visual field, visual acuity and functional MRI; positive subjective observations were also reported by patients [ 58]. QLT091001 entered a phase I trial enrolling 32 patients in . The authors claimed that non-invasive oral therapy is well tolerated, and it improved the visual functions of LCA patients with RPE65 and LRAT defects.  used high-definition optical coherence tomography and found a positive correlation of the photoreceptor layers larger baseline OS thickness with treatment response prediction . 5.3. RNA-Based Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy: QR-110 (Sepofarsen) Unlike LCA2 driven by the defective RPE65 enzyme, LCA10 is associated with splicing defects in cilia transport protein CEP290. LCA10 patients CEP290 pre-mRNA contains a hypomorphic cryptic splice site in intron 26 [ 6265]. As a result, two CEP290 transcriptsInt. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 14 of 24 are produced: wild type transcripts are produced in parallel with alternatively spliced transcripts containing an extra cryptic exon of 128 nucleotides that introduces a premature stop codon (p.Cys998*). The c.2991 + 1655A > G alleles hypomorphic nature results in significantly lower levels of functional CEP290, a key protein of the primary cilia [ 6668]. Photoreceptors are particularly vulnerable to disruptions of cilia function [ 69]. QR-110 is a single-stranded 20-O-methylated RNA antisense oligonucleotide that corrects splicing defect arising from the CEP290 c.2991 + 1655A > G mutation. (Figure 3) QR-110 was shown to restore the normal splicing of CEP290 in homozygous retinal organoids carrying the CEP290 c.2991 + 1655A > G mutation and thus restore normal CEP290 mRNA and protein, leading to increased ciliogenesis. Moreover, QR-110 was proven to be effective when used on retinal organoids due to its good accessibility to the retina and good tolerance following intravitreal (IVT) injection in humans [ 70]. QR-110 entered phase II in , followed by phase II/III in . There were no serious adverse events, and visual acuity, self-reported clarity and brightness in the treated eye were encouraging for the application of QR-110 in LCA10 patients. 5.4. Gene Editing Therapy: EDIT-101 The collaborative effort of Allergan, Editas Medicine and the University of Florida translated the very first gene-editing approach to treat LCA10 to clinical trials in . AGN151587 (EDIT-101) was designed to excise the pathogenic splice site, which would result in the normal splicing and expression of CEP290 protein [ 71]. (Figure 3.) Another group using a single AAV vector, , circumvented the limitation of the carrying capacity of AAV by using a smaller Staphylococcus aureus CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 system that allowed an AAV5 vector to deliver the Cas9 gene and two guide RNAs [ 72] under the regulation of the GRK1 promoter that is specific to photoreceptors only. Advance in preclinical study was shown as EDIT-101 performed gene editing after its delivery to humanized CEP290 mice. Hence, in September , EDIT-101 entered clinical trial phase I/II with 19 patients enrolled to evaluate single ascending dose effects in participants with LCA10. To date, no study report has been published. 6. Limitations and Challenges A comprehensive review of clinical trial reports brought to light numerous unmet challenges of retinal viral gene therapy. These include the lack of a control vector to distinguish the therapeutic effect between the vector and RPE65 re-establishment to ensure that any improvements specifically reflect the expression of the protein encoded in the AAV vector. Therapy complications generally do not arise from exposure to viral vectors but rather from intervention with the subretinal administration. Furthermore, high patient success variability and a lack of reliable baseline comparison within a small sample group raise concerns on upgrading/refining future development. 6.1. Surgical Complications In , Young and Bok identified that primate photoreceptors renew their OS within two months [ 73]. In , it was shown that the standard configuration of the experimentally detached retina returned to normal within 1 to 2 months [ 74], laying the foundations for the use of the subretinal intervention. However, it was not until  that Cooper and Thomas consolidated the use of subretinal surgery techniques [ 75]. Due to the limited target effect of intravitreal delivery in the posterior segment of the retina, only subretinal delivery of vectors can ensure safe and efficient transduction of photoreceptors and RPE cells [ 6]. The most common AAV vectors do not efficiently target the outer retina following intravitreal injection [ 7679]. While most postoperative subretinal detachments are reversible and subject to repair, several studies reported myriad surgical complications that may result in macular hole development [ 48,54,60]. These common complications include effusions, hypotonia, retinal tears, subconjunctival hemorrhage, ocular hyperemia and increased intraocular pressure [52,60,80].  devised a safer administration,Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 15 of 24 whereby up to 1mL of rAAV vector could be delivered through a single retinotomy without causing tears in the thinned, degenerated retina [ 81]. With the complications delineated above, subretinal injections are thus contraindicated in fragile and degenerating retinas, significantly limiting the population who may benefit from the therapy. The demand for intravitreal injection has ignited research on the directed evolution or design of specific capsid mutations that may lead vectors to target the outer retina via intravitreal injection [ 82,83]. Furthermore, subretinal injection is a procedure that requires a surgical room and general anesthesia that also possesses inherent risks. Surgical complications necessitate the development of vectors that may target the outer retina via intravitreal injection, which may also be performed at a clinic with local anesthesia. 6.2. Variability of Patient Response Patient response to RPE65 gene therapy was shown to be variable within and between studies.  observed the gain of visual function in 9 out of 12 patients. However, the individual visual function parameters that improved varied among these patients, and two patients showed a decrease in BCVA in the treated eye compared to the untreated eye [ 80]. In contrast to the successful stories exemplified by Luxturna, the trial (NCT00821340) testing the rAAV2-hRPE65 vector showed drastically different results. Instead of improving visual acuity, post-treatment visual acuity decreased predictably due to the temporal retinal detachment induced by subretinal administration and returned to preoperative levels only by six months [ 48]. No clinically significant improvement was observed in any of the three patients, as determined by Goldmann perimetry testing, microperimetry, or pattern electroretinography. The advertised advantage of RPE65 gene therapy was the improvement of nystagmus; however, nystagmus in two patients who suffered from high-amplitude nystagmus showed no resolution [ 48]. This was consistent with a trial by Cideciyan, where it was reported that none of their patients demonstrated decreases in nystagmus. Out of the three patients, visual function only improved in one patient [ 48]. The varied patient response may be a consequence of a considerable variation in baseline visual function and differences in vector administration site . Analyzing the physiology behind it, Cideciyan proposed two hypotheses for slow chromophore delivery rate: (i) reduced rate of synthesis and (ii) increased physical or chemical barrier to its transport. The evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes: (1) the dramatic accumulation of all-trans-retinyl ester (precursor of rhodopsin) in RPE, (2) disorganized and unhealthy rod OS that aggravates the resistive barrier [ 46,8486] and (3) altered RPE/photoreceptor interface due to subretinal administration induced retinal detachment [ 87]. The low expression of RPE65 despite successful retinal transfection could reduce the rate of chromophore synthesis and act as an enzymatic limiting stage to rhodopsin regeneration, as observed in mice engineered to express low levels of wild type RPE65 . This enzymatic bottleneck must be circumvented with a vector that allows the higher expression of RPE65 . Furthermore, limitations of the small sample of patients are aggravated when the study design does not involve the randomization of eyes, namely, clinicians tend to preferentially treat patients with worse vision. Another bias arises when examiners are not masked to the study eye versus control eye. The statistical approach was thus confounded by numerous issues [ 60]. During the postoperative period, patients may have an inclination to use the control eye and are unaware of visual gain in the treated eye, unless dictated to do so . An additional confounder arises from the presence of nystagmus and amblyopia. These conditions would dictate the amount of time the eye can fixate on a particular object and is known to affect the degree of cortical activation that may induce false positive improvements in LCA patients [ 89]. Lastly, the heterogeneity of disease progression and the nature of RPE65 mutation should be evaluated and grouped on an individual basis for relevant comparisons .Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 16 of 24 6.3. Readministration Safety Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl was the first randomized gene therapy trial for a genetic disease to enter phase 3.  stress that the current clinical trials that use an uninjected contralateral eye as a control are not reflective of the clinical scenario where bilateral administration would be given. Unilateral injection of therapeutics also does not allow the relevant assessment of systemic effects [ 8]. Hence,  aimed to address whether the readministration of virus-mediated gene delivery to the patients exposed to priory delivery with the same vector may elicit immune responses that would diminish the retinal improvements and visual function of the originally injected eye. An intriguing observation revealed that the initially injected eyes function improved after the readministration into the second eye, as shown by fMRI. Surprisingly, the second treated eyes had better clinical performance than the first treated eye, despite being severely damaged for more than 2.5 decades. After confirmation by pupillometry, fMRI and fullfield sensitivity testing, the second eye became more sensitive to dim light. A universal phenomenon observed in numerous trials was that post-treatment retinal and cortical responses did not show spontaneous recovery. Similar to experimental results in large animals, the progression in retinal and cortical responses showed a continuous increase in early stages and plateaued between 1.5 and 3 months postadministration [ 55]. Noteworthy, after confirming the therapeutic effects and safety in three adults who had received a unilateral subretinal injection of AAV2-hRPE65v2 previously,  aimed to restore vision in injected eyes and evaluate the safety and efficacy of the second injection in the NCT01208389 trial [ 55]. As the AAV capsid and foreign RPE65 are potential antigens, physicians were concerned that the readministration would result in an inflammatory response upon re-exposure. Nevertheless,  demonstrated that readministration was not accompanied by the potentially damaging immune response. The safety profile of readministration may be due to the eyes immune-privilege nature and the small volume of the ocular compartment that enables a low vector dosage . 6.4. Age-Dependent  also observed that younger individuals tended to achieve better vision recovery than older patients. However, these results may also reflect an age effect, whereby the retina from younger patients had not undergone as much deterioration and toxin buildup [ 55]. Nevertheless,  argued that age did not significantly affect either the overall visual improvement parameters of the participants. Surprisingly, the most dramatic visual acuity increases were observed in two older patients (aged 24 and 30).  further addressed the reason behind the proposed trend as a matter of emphasis. They believed a similar improvement in a child patients light sensitivity would be emphasized over the same improvement in an adult patient. Similarly, the younger patients mobility performance was studied uniocularly with lower room illuminations, whereas the older patients were studied binocularly at 250 lux light level [ 60]. An ongoing  aimed to determine whether treatment efficacy may be enhanced in a population with amblyopia and retinal degeneration has not been concluded . 6.5. Inappropriate Clinical Markers It is not clear whether the improvement in visual responses is entirely due to enhanced levels of RPE65 in the retina. It is not safe and ethical to obtain evidence merely through the biopsy of retinal material [ 5]. Some studies have demonstrated improved navigational abilities using the newly injected eye [ 55]. Functional assays to study retinal function, such as navigational abilities, were elaborated through trial and error.  therein pioneered using more objective parameters, such as psychophysical testing and fMRI measurements, to study the responsiveness or activation of neurons in the visual cortex that processes vision. Their study confirmed that the gene augmentation therapy of LCA2 patients rendered the retina (and visual cortex) activation more sensitive to dimmer light and lower contrast stimuli [ 89].  confirmed an increase in visualInt. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 17 of 24 acuity post-treatment when comparing low levels of spatial vision to recovery levels that were still low. The improvement of vision in dim light was patient self-reported and not objectively quantified [ 48]. Since the clinical presentation, the hallmark of LCA is nyctalopia, night blindness that makes navigation difficult in dim light. Hence, the novel outcome measure of functional vision based on assessing different degrees/Lux of light levels and navigation accuracy, called the Multi-luminance Mobility Test (MLMT), was proposed. The MLMT measures individuals navigating while avoiding obstacles at seven standardized illumination levels with a pass or fail based on course navigation completed within 180 s with three or fewer errors. Additionally, a positive score indicates passing the MLMT at a lower light level. 6.6. Short Follow-Up and Small  maintained a follow up of six months, but acknowledged the need for longer follow up and a larger patient pool to determine safety and efficacy measures and to identify factors influencing the extent and duration of visual recovery [ 55]. To circumvent the small sample size bias,  designed a measurement method that allows statistical high-power acquisition for a small trial. Using the MLMT framework to convert various lighting conditions into a continuous metric provides the quantification of the continuous improvement . 6.7. Undeterred Onset of Photoreceptor Degeneration Gene augmentation therapy for RPE65 deficiency using AAV2/2 vectors can improve different aspects of sight in humans [ 5,48,52,80,90]. However, the central question in gene therapy efficacy is whether the disease progression can be halted. Progressive retinal degeneration limits the efficacy of retinal sensitivity in the long run, and the functional improvements in photoreceptor cells found in animal models have been relatively mild in humans [ 6,81,91]. Yet, subjective outcome measurements, such as visual acuity, Goldmann perimetry, navigational vision and pupillometry, were reported to reveal improvements. RPE65 protein expression in humans is greater than in dogs, indicating a greater demand for RPE65 protein in the former. The balance between efficacy and dosage-induced toxicity limits the benefits of current vectors  Young RPE65-mutant dogs (4 months) were given interventions and then evaluated 511 years later. Minimal degenerative changes in the injection sites indicated that gene therapy indeed halted degeneration progress. However, such beneficial effects were not observed in humans [ 93]. This raises questions as to whether variations in age, stage of disease, species, mutations or complications cause the difference. Treatment in older age may not prevent structural degeneration. Despite the uncertainties, phase I trials have shown that gene therapy is safe, stable and restores partial retinal function . 7. CRISPR-Cas9 System Application in Inherited Retinal Dystrophies Gene augmentation therapy through AAV-mediated gene delivery has shown promising therapeutic effects clinically; however, the stringent cargo limit of vectors narrows its application to only a portion of cases with mutations in causative genes of relatively small size [ 95]. Thus, approaches other than gene augmentation are in demand for a vast population of IRD patients. CRISPR-Cas9 is emerging as a new gene-editing tool to address the issue. The system utilizes guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to specific gene loci proximal to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), inducing a double-strand break (DSB). Cell machinery then repairs the CRISPR-targeted site by performing non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [9698]. To date, retinal gene therapy approaches can be categorized into mutation dependent and mutation independent. In the mutation-independent approach, all endogenous chromosomal target genes, namely, both of the alleles, are ablated permanently by the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, while exogenous wild type cDNA is supplemented to complement the gene loss. P23H and D190N are two common mutations in the rhodopsin ( RHO )Int. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 18 of 24 gene that result in the autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) [ 99]. Two separate vectors, AAV-gRNA-mRho promoter-hRHO cDNA and AAV-Cas9, were mixed and subretinally injected into a RhoP23H or RhoD190N mutation knock-in mouse model. The ablate and supplement treatment caused an improvement in retinal outer nuclear layer thickness and better preservation of a and b wave amplitude compared to the gene augmentation control only group [ 100]. Koji M. et al. proposed a system termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), with small microhomology arms of approximately 20 bps, MMEJ allows the specific integration of complementary DNA into the desired genome loci via a single AAV platform. Compared with dual vector-based mutation replacement, the MMEJ system showed an improvement in genome editing efficacy and thus showed robust restoration of the visual function in retinal dystrophy mouse models [ 101]. The combination of CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ or MMEJ that mediated mutant allele knockout and concomitant delivery of the wild type cDNA that compensated for the loss of the endogenous target gene combination has shown potency to correct mutations via AAV-mediated delivery. In a mutation-dependent approach, dominant mutant genes in the heterozygous pair of alleles responsible for the dysfunction can be selectively disrupted, while the wild type allele gene should maintain its expression. Differentiation between wild type and mutant alleles during Cas9 cleavage is achieved through the requirement of Cas9 activity upon recognizing PAM. Serine amino acid substitution at the 334/338 site results in the dysfunction of rhodopsin protein and affects protein trafficking to the photoreceptor OS. The selective deletion of RhoS334in the rat model stopped the RHOS334production; meanwhile, normal Rhocould be expressed dominantly [ 102]. Another example of mutant knockout was demonstrated in the retina of RhoP23H heterozygous mice. Results showed a reduced expression of mutant P23H transcript and improved thickness of photoreceptor layers . Though the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized gene therapy in several aspects, the drawbacks are that CRISPR mandates highly allele-specific designs, while gene defects underlying IRDs are extremely heterogeneous. Genetic heterogeneity has made the development of IRD gene therapy prohibitive, as clinical trials are mandatory for every mutation [ 104]. As a result, instead of manipulating the mutant genes, some studies turned to targets that could be applied to a larger population, for example, the neural retina-specific leucine zipper ( Nrl) gene. In RP disease progression, the loss of cone, which results in blindness, is considered to be a secondary effect of rods degeneration. The Nrlgene is a determinant in the development of rod photoreceptors, and it also plays a key role in maintaining rod function and homeostasis in mature rod photoreceptors. Consequently, the knockdown Nrlby AAV-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 in mice induced morphology and functional changes in rods, allowing the cells to overcome the degeneration progress [ 105]. 8. Conclusions and Future Initiatives In summary, the evolution of gene therapy has overcome many barriers to achieve translation from fundamental science advancements to clinical development and proved to be relatively safe in multiple clinical trials, albeit with variations in outcomes. Among these clinical trials, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna) that targets RPE65 -associated LCA was the first FDA-approved gene therapy drug, while other clinical trials of IRDs, including Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Choroideremia and X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP), are also under way. In addition to Luxturna, three clinical trials advanced to Phase III collectively, including antisense oligonucleotides-based QR-110 for LCA10, AAV5-RPRG gene-drug for XLRP and AAV2-REP1 for choroideremia (Table 1). To date, clinical trials are mostly gene augmentation therapies that deliver the correct gene to the retina to restore its function. A few studies have taken advantage of antisense oligonucleotides to direct the normal splicing of mutant pre-mRNA and thus correct the mutation on the mRNA level. A gene editing strategy using the CRISPR-Cas9 system is utilized in correcting gene aberrations by editing the pathogenic variants in a targeted fashion. Despite the advances in IRD gene therapies, how to tackle IRDs presenting with early onset degeneration orInt. J. Mol. Sci.  ,22, 4534 19 of 24 causing aberrant retinal development is unsolved. In such cases, gene augmentation intervention may be applied early, even in utero, raising ethical and practical challenges. Furthermore, AAV-based gene therapy drawbacks include low transduction efficiency and viral capsule immunogenic adverse effects; thus, proper dosage optimization is required to find a compromise between these two factors. Each RPE cell serves up to 40 photoreceptor cells in the primate retina [ 106]; therefore, targeting RPE-specific mutations (such as RPE65 ) results in an amplified intervention effect and requires a lower dosage. On the other hand, targeting photoreceptor-specific genes may require the optimization of vectors to increase the tropism towards this cell type. As such, AAV8-based vectors can be more preferential than AAV2-based vectors, as the former is more efficient in transducing photoreceptors, to date; the development of higher efficiency viral vectors may be required in the future [ 107].

keywords of patient-reported outcome, questionnaire, retinal dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, retinitis pigmentosa. The search was limited to PubMed indexed Englishlanguage journals and PROs identified in previous reviews that are disease-specific to a condition of inherited retinal degeneration. In this review, we will discuss the use of PRO instruments, status of current PROs, and recommendations for PRO development. There will be particular emphasis on three key features of PRO development described by the FDA and their particular importance in IRD gene therapy populations. A validated PRO measure is an instrument that has undergone a qualitative analysis of in-depth patient interviews as well as thorough quantitative statistical analysis to determine the measures reliability and ability to detect change in the target population. After a review of the existing PRO literature, we have found  Page 2 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinstruments do not fully meet the needs of a PRO for gene therapy clinical trials therapy and suggest the development of a novel PRO for this application. Why use PRO Instruments? Patient-reported outcome measures offer a means of capturing patients experience of how their vision condition affects their daily life. These measures are commonly administered as questionnaires that can be used as a screening tool for visual impairment or as a functional outcome measure, and their application results in an enhanced communication between the patient and provider by uncovering aspects of vision and living that might otherwise would be ignored. Despite the variety of clinical tests used to diagnose and monitor IRDs, researchers and clinicians still struggle to relate the results of clinical tests to a patients experience. Here we will highlight three prominent challenges facing reliance on the results of current visual and retinal function tests in the IRD population. First, each clinical test individually does not capture the breadth of visual dysfunction and there is no gold standard test that can fully characterize the impact an IRD has on a patient. As a result, physicians often order a large number of clinical tests for IRD patients. Although recommendations have been made for standardizing testing and outcome measures, patient burden from several hours of testing can be significant, and often the tests yield findings that fail to address domains that are relevant to their condition and its treatment( 13). Second, clinical test results can be incongruent with what the patient is experiencing. For example, patients may report changes to their vision, yet their visual acuity shows no change. Further investigation and testing may help explain patient symptoms, as seen with contrast sensitivity testing in patients with Stargardts disease and normal visual acuity( 15). Ultimately, a patients quality of life should be the most important consideration in evaluating treatment efficacy, and thus PRO instruments have the potential to be the most comprehensive measure of a clinically meaningful treatment effect. Third, the outcome of often-used tests such as visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography can show substantial test-retest variability in the IRD population( 8 10)and some claim that these supposedly objective measures could be influenced by patients moods or feelings about their general health( 11, 16). This presents a challenge in interpreting and analyzing test results over time in IRD patients. In preparation for their clinical trials, groups have attempted to quantify the degree of variability in clinical tests for ABCA4 (12, 17), RS1(7), CHM (18), RPE65 (19) to inform the use of these data to define meaningful change beyond variability in these measures. High quality PRO instruments are designed to offer reliable measures in their target population, which can mitigate the potentially inconsistent data obtained from clinical testing measures. In IRD gene therapy research, PRO tools have provided meaningful data to demonstrate treatment efficacy. In August , published results of a Phase 3 trial of voretigene neparvovec (trade name: Luxterna) showed patient improvement in two non- Page 3 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptstandard outcome measuresresults of a mobility task and a PRO instrument, the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) that measures visual functioning in a variety of domains. ( 20) In response to this report and previous findings, Luxturna was approved for treatment of RPE65-mediated IRD in December ( 21). Research to-date places a heavy reliance on a small number of tested and validated PRO questionnaires. While well-established instruments such as the NEI VFQ-25 are high-quality and valuable tools, they were not designed for use in IRD populations nor for gene therapy trials. As will be discussed further in this article, use of a PRO instrument as an outcome measure requires careful consideration of the appropriateness of a particular instrument for the target population. Despite these issues, to our knowledge, the only validated PRO instrument that has been used in published gene therapy trials for IRDs is the NEI VFQ-25. Of the peer-reviewed publications of clinical trials in RPE65 , XLRS , and CHM ; three studies have included the NEI VFQ-25 as an outcome measure( 20, 22, 23). An additional three studies have anecdotally included patient commentary on the perceived changes in their vision from treatment ( 2426). While patient interviews yield information on PROs, without standardizing the method of collecting patient experience and validating the questionnaire, the utility of patient commentaries is limited. Of the 54 gene therapy trials listed in  in the National Clinical Trials (NCT) database, 17 note the use of a PRO instrument. Only 7 of these trials specify use of a questionnaire that has been validated for use in other conditions in the NCT listings (NEI VFQ-25, SF-36). We note that in ongoing clinical trials it is possible that not all information on the trials methods is publicly available. While results from PROs are not required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, they are highly recommended by the FDA to be incorporated in a clinical trial. They have been identified as valuable outcome measures in other fields such as intraocular lenses ( 27) and the FDA has produced guidelines for PRO tool development ( 28). Published FDA guidelines highlight four properties for evaluation of a PRO as an outcome measure: validity, reliability, ability to detect change, and interpretability ( 28). This review will focus on the first three criteria. Validity (i.e. content-related, criterion-related, predictive) refers to the capacity of the PRO instrument to describe the trait it intends to measure. Reliability (i.e. test-retest, internal consistency, inter-interviewer reproducibility) describes the consistency of the measurements taken using the PRO instrument. The instruments ability to detect change (i.e. effect size, standard error) reflects the sensitivity of the test. Inherited Retinal Dystrophy-Specific PRO Measures Khadka, Senthil, and colleagues have evaluated the content, measurement, psychometric, and validation properties of the existing ophthalmologic questionnaires relative to FDA guidelines ( 29, 30). In their study of IRD PRO instruments, 11 IRD- Page 4 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinstruments were identified (9 for retinitis pigmentosa, 1 for Stargardts disease, and 1 for Congenital Stationary Night Blindness) and few had been adequately validated. To our knowledge, these disease-specific PROs have not been incorporated into past or existing gene therapy trials. We will discuss the merits of each of the PRO instruments and discuss the limitations to their application in IRD gene therapy clinical trials. Perceived Visual Function Questionnaire. As mentioned earlier, clinical function tests may not always reflect a patients subjective experience. To address this concern, Lodha and colleagues developed a PRO instrument and compared PRO responses with visual acuity, visual field, and contrast sensitivity testing in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) ( 2). They identified correlations between PRO items related to near vision with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity when these factors were combined (r=0.609). Similarly, they found a correlation between global vision items and combined visual field and visual acuity (r=0.545). This study is informative in its contribution to the understanding of the intersection of patient reports and clinical testing. However, the study gives little information regarding how PRO items were derived and psychometrically validated. Activities of Daily Vision & Daily Task Performance Questionnaire. Szlyk and colleagues have developed two PRO instruments designed to evaluate the functional tasks and activity limitations experienced by patients with RP ( 3, 31). The first PRO instrument they developed combined two existing questionnaires and added additional questions intended to be specific to RP-related difficulties ( 3). Using factor analysis, they categorized tasks into 6 categories and created a composite score. Additionally, their analysis generated a predictive model to evaluate the relative correlations of visual acuity, visual fields, and ERG to patient-reported functional abilities. Their findings suggest that acuity scores significantly correlated (p<0.01) with 28/33 PRO items (r=0.220.57), while 18/33 items correlated with V-4-e (r=0.200.47) and 23/33 with II-4-e (r=0.210.45) Goldmann visual field areas. ERG data added minimally to the correlation between PRO items and visual acuity and visual fields( 3). In a follow-up to their previous work, the group sought to evaluate how well patient perception of their functional abilities matched their actual functional ability ( 31). Using the Activities of Daily Vision questionnaire and adding 20 RPspecific items identified by expert opinion, their results showed a significant correlation (p<0.01) between 29 of the 32 questionnaire items and a functional assessment by a lowvision specialist (r=0.130.70). In addition, they observed significant correlations (p<0.01) between questionnaire domains (reading/mobility/peripheral detection) and logMAR visual acuity (r s=0.55/0.40/0.38), visual field (r s=0.42/0.47/0.55), contrast sensitivity (rs=0.62/0.54/0.52) and ERG. While both studies are informative, the methods for generating PRO items using in-depth interviews with patients with IRDs and the extent to which the PROs were psychometrically validated are unclear. Independent Mobility Questionnaire & Mobility Difficulties Questionnaire. Turano  developed a PRO targeted to assess mobility in RP patients based on expert opinion and a literature review( 5). One hundred and forty-five patients completed the questionnaire but V A, VF, and contrast sensitivity data were available from only 32 patients. From these PRO data, they created a person-measure to describe the overall ability  Page 5 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpatient. When comparing the clinical data, Turano et al reported that 57% of the variability in person-measure scores could be attributed to V A, contrast sensitivity, and VF converted to a functional retinal area. The strength of this PRO is the development process specifically addressing mobility in patients with RP as well as thorough psychometric analysis of the PRO data. The limitations of this PRO include its sole focus on mobility, its reliance on clinical testing that was performed in a small subpopulation of patients, and the lack of patient input in generating the questionnaire items. In a subsequent study, the group sought to examine how RP patients mobility varies under different lighting conditions( 6). Responses from 25 patients with RP on a 4-item questionnaire were significantly correlated with the walking speed of patients performing a mobility task when patients reported difficulty in more than one area (p<0.01). Furthermore, the group reported that contrast sensitivity and visual field extent accounted for 69% of the variance in walking speed. While short questionnaires provide certain advantages, this 4-item questionnaire was not validated and was limited to evaluating mobility in the context of varying lighting conditions. Everyday Task Questionnaire. In a continuation of their previous work, Lowe and Drasdo sought to broadly describe the patient experience with RP( 32). Forty-eight patients with RP were sent a 16-item questionnaire and Snellen chart via mail. Patients were asked to complete the questionnaire and record their V A at home. Through these responses, they collected information regarding common features of RP, however the small sample size, and lack of validation present challenges for further application. Vision-Related Activity of Daily Living & Field Expander Questionnaire. In the course of studying visual field expander aids, two different groups created PRO instruments to collect information on patient experience ( 33, 34). While both studies were performed in small populations (16 and 10 patients), the questions were adapted to their RP low-vision aid users. The small sample size, specific focus of the questions, lack of validation, and insufficient information given regarding the PRO questionnaire all limit the generalizability of these PROs for use in other studies. Stargardts Macular Dystrophy Vision Questionnaire & Night Vision Questionnaire. Apart from RP, only two PROs have been developed to target other IRDs. Miedziak et al studied 200 patients with Stargardts disease to better characterize the condition( 35). The group created a PRO tool based on existing instruments and patient input. While a strength of this PRO is its development in a large Stargardts population, applying this PRO to all other IRDs would be inappropriate. Additionally, the validation methods of this PRO instrument are unclear. In a study of 101 Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB) patients, Bijveld et al attempted to specifically address night vision and created a PRO instrument that was based on existing low luminance questionnaires with some additional questions( 1). While CSNB is an inherited retinal condition, the non-progressive nature of CSNB as well as the isolated symptom of night blindness are key distinguishers that limit the use of this PRO in a larger IRD population. Page 6 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptGuidelines for PRO Creation in IRD Gene Therapy Trials Novel and existing PRO instruments used in clinical trials must be held to the same scientific standards as required for other outcome measures. Critically, the use of a particular PRO instrument must have demonstrated validity and reliability as well as appropriateness for its suggested application( 14). To-date, no clinical trials have used publicly available PRO tools intended for use in the IRD gene therapy trials. Development for intended population. First, it is critical that a PRO instrument used in an IRD clinical trial has sound psychometric properties when applied to the target population. As Patrick et al and FDA colleagues have highlighted, the basic psychometric features of a PRO instrument are its reliability, validity, and ability to detect change ( 28, 36). In order for the application of a PRO to be appropriate for a clinical trial, each of these instrument features must be tested and proven in the IRD population targeted for clinical trials. The PRO should be developed for application to patients with a diagnosed retinal dystrophy who meet the eligibility criteria of the clinical trial (i.e. appropriate visual acuity, visual field, and ERG). While IRD clinical trials are largely enrolled based on identified pathogenic variants of genes (i.e. RPE65 , ABCA4 , etc.), given the similarity in clinical characteristics across many IRDs, we consider it appropriate to develop a PRO instrument in a non-gene specific IRD population first. As we gain further insight on these conditions e.g., defined by genotype--and their responses to treatment, developing genotype-specific IRD PRO instruments may be warranted. At this time, a comprehensive PRO measure that evaluates all domains of visual dysfunction causing limitations, validated in a general IRD population (i.e. non gene-specific) has the greatest utility. Notably, many IRD clinical trials are conducted in children which presents additional challenges to the validity and reliability of these measures. Items addressed in a PRO must be comprehendible and relevant to the development level of the population. Patient input. The basis for generating applicable content and items in a PRO instrument is patient input. Patrick and colleagues have detailed the appropriate methodology for collecting and analyzing the qualitative data generated from patient input ( 37, 38). This involves a series of in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients to capture their perceptions of how their vision relates to basic domains of their daily life (e.g., functioning, emotional, social) with a series of open-ended questions. These interviews are qualitatively analyzed, and items are identified and sifted by software such as Atlas TI (Version 8.1.3 (522) Atlas.ti, Germany) . Based on identification of recurrent items, common themes and points of emphasis (items), along with obtaining guidance from a panel of experts in the field (retinal specialists, genetic counselors, occupational therapists, electrophysiologists, for example), a set of questions are developed that are designed to address all of the domains in a relevant, understandable, and comprehensive manner. From this, specific PRO items can be generated to target the identified patient symptoms and experiences. After these items are drafted, researchers must solicit more feedback from patients in the form of a cognitive interview to ensure the items clearly and consistently capture their intended concepts. As emphasized by Patrick et al, expert opinion is not a  Page 7 Ophthalmic Genet . Author manuscript; available in PMC  February 26. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsubstitute for this process of direct patient input in establishing content validity of an instrument ( 36). While many PROs are not validated in patients with severely limited vision, questions must be targeted and relevant to the low-vision IRD population. As these conditions are congenital and slowly progressing, patients may have lived with poor vision and/or subtle visual decline their entire life. Therefore, some common activities and experiences included in existing PRO instruments may not be relevant; for example, questions related to driving a car. Patient input is the only method of generating items that are targeting meaningful patient experiences and activities. For these reasons, we highly encourage patient involvement in the early development of content and questions via the in-depth and cognitive interview methods described in FDA guidelines and supporting literature( 28, 37, 38). Psychometric evaluation. After the PRO instrument has been administered to a large sample of patients, statistical analysis must be performed on the collected data. FDA guidelines do not specify the methodology of statistical evaluation. However, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and the ability to detect change (responsiveness) are noted as critical items to address in a novel PRO instrument ( 28, 36). Given that IRDs are slowly progressing, patient reports should yield consistent findings over short time intervals (i.e. two weeks). The measure must elicit reproducible responses from patients and can be tested directly by repeat administration of the PRO instrument to a subset of patients to ensure reliability. We encourage careful consideration of this concept when designing a PRO for children as consistency in responses may be a particular concern. The ability of a PRO instrument to detect change might be a particular challenge in developing a PRO for the IRD gene therapy population. While many gene therapy trial candidates may have very limited vision, floor effects in the distribution of PRO data raise substantial concerns. PRO items must be able to generate results that detect the subtle differences in ability and/or experience from person to person. Capturing such subtle differences requires careful thought in designing a response scale or metric for each intended question. The responses must have sensitivity to the rate and manner that IRD patients experience vision loss. When examining the same patient over time, the PRO instrument must be sensitive to change in both natural disease progression as well as sensitive enough to detect a possible treatment effect of improved visual function. PRO statistical analysis conducted using factor analysis methods have been described as yielding first-generation instruments ( 39). Some have advocated the creation of secondgeneration instruments that are based on applying Rasch validation techniques ( 39, 40). The FDA does not advocate for the use of a particular statistical method to use in its guidelines. With the proliferation of gene therapy trials that are intended for regulatory approval, use of validated PRO instruments for IRD-specific populations is imperative to fully understand treatment efficacy. To our knowledge, there is currently no PRO instrument developed for and validated in the population of potential IRD gene therapy candidates. We assert  Page 8 Ophthalmic Genet .

miR- 181a/b downregulation: a mutation-independent therapeutic approach for Sabrina Carrella1,2,*, Martina Di Guida1,3, Simona Brillante1, Davide Piccolo1, Ludovica Ciampi1, Irene Guadagnino1,3, Jorge Garcia Piqueras1,3, Mariateresa Pizzo1, Elena Marrocco1, Marta Molinari1, Georgios Petrogiannakis1,4, Sara Barbato1, Yulia Ezhova1,4, Alberto Auricchio1,5, Brunella Franco1,6,7, Elvira De Leonibus1,8, Enrico Maria Surace6, Alessia Indrieri1,9& Sandro Banfi1,3,** Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of diseases whose common landmark is progressive photoreceptor loss. The develop-ment of gene-specific therapies for IRDs is hampered by their widegenetic heterogeneity. Mitochondrial dysfunction is proving toconstitute one of the key pathogenic events in IRDs; hence,approaches that enhance mitochondrial activities have a promis-ing therapeutic potential for these conditions. We previouslyreported that miR- 181a/b downregulation boosts mitochondrial turnover in models of primary retinal mitochondrial diseases. Here,we show that miR- 181a/b silencing has a beneficial effect also in IRDs. In particular, the injection in the subretinal space of anadeno-associated viral vector (AAV) that harbors a miR- 181a/b inhibitor (sponge) sequence (AAV 2/8-GFP-Sponge-miR- 181a/b) improves retinal morphology and visual function both in models ofautosomal dominant ( RHO-P 347S) and of autosomal recessive (rd10 ) retinitis pigmentosa. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR181a/b downregulation modulates the level of the mitochondrial fission-related protein Drp 1and rescues the mitochondrial fragmentation in RHO-P 347Sphotoreceptors. Overall, these data support the potential use of miR- 181a/b downregulation as an innovative mutation-independent therapeutic strategy for IRDs,which can be effective both to delay disease progression and toaid gene-specific therapeutic approaches.

They encompass a variety of different clinical subtypessuch as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Leber congenital amaurosis(LCA), and macular diseases. IRDs display extensive genetic hetero-geneity with more than 250 causative genes identified thus far( ). Gene-replacement therapies are proving to be effective in the treatment of IRDs caused byloss-of-function mutations as exemplified by the recent approvalof Voretigene Neparvovec for the treatment of conditions caused bymutations in the RPE65 gene (Ledford,  ; Apte,  ). Unfortunately, gene replacement cannot be effectively applied to IRDscaused by gain-of-function mutations, in which the silencing ofthe mutated allele is primarily required. Moreover, the highgenetic heterogeneity of IRDs significantly limit the set up of 1Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), Pozzuoli, Italy 2Ecosustainable Marine Biotechnology Department, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy 3Medical Genetics, Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania L.

EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | 1of19gene/mutation-specific approaches that can be applied to a large fraction of patients (Carrella et al, ). Gene/mutation-independent therapeutic strategies that aim at decreasing and/or delaying cell death in the affected retina, inde-pendently of the primary genetic defect, constitute a valid and/orcomplementary alternative to gene-based approaches (Carrella et al,  ). Degeneration of photoreceptors (PRs) is the common landmark in IRDs even though a precise knowledge of the underlyingmolecular and cellular events is still far from reach. Among the mostrelevant pathways involved, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroin-flammation, and microglia activation are known to worsen PR deathand accelerate disease progression (Ambati et al, ; Cuenca et al, ; Zhao et al, ; Lefevere et al, ; Mirra & Marfany,  ; Carrella et al, ). Targeting key effectors that impact on common dysregulated pathways in neuronal damage during diseaseprogression hold great promise for therapeutic purposes (Indrieriet al, ; Carrella et al, ). In the latter respect, microRNAs (miRNAs), given their ability to simultaneously modulate multiplemolecular pathways commonly associated with disease pathogene-sis and progression, constitute appealing targets toward the designof gene/mutation-independent therapeutic strategies (Askou et al,  ). We recently identified miR-181a and miR-181b (miR-181a/b) as possible therapeutic targets for mitochondrial-related retinal dis-eases (Indrieri et al, ). MiR-181a/b are highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and in different retinal cell types(Busskamp et al, ; Indrieri et al, ). They are part of the miR-181 miRNA family and are localized in two distinct genomicclusters in mammals ( miR-181a/b-1 and miR-181a/b-2 ). The mature forms of miR-181a and miR-181b produced by both clus-ters show identical sequences. Furthermore, the seed sequence,that is, the domain hypothesized to play the most relevant role intarget recognition, is identical between miR-181a and miR-181b(Indrieri et al, ). Several mitochondrial-related transcripts are direct targets of miR-181a/b, for example, Bcl2,Mcl1 , and Park2 (Ouyang et al, ; Cheng et al, ). We recently demonstrated that miR-181a/b control mitochondrial turnover and func-tion in vivo by targeting genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and clearance, as well as in reactive oxigenspecies (ROS) detoxification (i.e., Tfam ,Nrf1,Cox11 ,CoQ10B , and Prdx3 ) (Indrieri etal, ; Barbato et al, ). Genetic inactivation of miR-181a/b-1 leads to increased levels of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in the retina of mouse models of pri-mary mitochondrial dysfunction leading to strong protection fromneuronal cell death and to significant amelioration of the diseasephenotype (Indrieri et al, ). In particular, we showed that genetic inactivation of miR-181a/b-1 protects retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and ameliorates visual function in different mouse modelsof Lebers hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) strongly indicatingthat these miRNAs may represent effective therapeutic targets forthis disease (Indrieri et al, ). Notably, we also demonstrated that miR-181a/ b-1ablation did not cause per se neither abnormalities in retinal morphology nor alteration of retinal function, thussupporting the safety of miR-181a/b downregulation in the retina(Indrieri et al, ). Over the last decades, evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction to IRDs is increasing (Carrella et al, ). The outer retina is known to have a high metabolic demand, which is associated withabundance of mitochondria in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)and PRs. The latter cells are under constant environmental chal-lenges and are highly prone to oxidative stress, a major contributorto retinal degenerations and hence IRDs (Lefevere et al, ; Mirra & Marfany,  ; Jiang et al, ). Importantly, since mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be an early event in IRDs, approachestargeting basic mitochondrial functions hold great therapeuticpromise (Lefevere et al, ; Carrella et al, ). Here, we tested the possible neuroprotective effect of miR-181a/ b downregulation in IRDs. We demonstrated that miR-181a/b down-regulation protects PRs from death and ameliorates their morphol-ogy, resulting in improvement of visual function in two differentIRD models. We also observed amelioration of mitochondria mor-phology in PRs, along with a concomitant downregulation of themitochondrial fission protein Drp1 mediated by the activation of theJAK2/STAT3 pathway. Our data unveil a novel molecular mecha-nism by which miR-181a/b regulate mitochondrial morphology andfunction in diseased conditions and identified an AAV-mediatedsponge strategy to efficiently downregulate miR-181a/b in vivo .W e demonstrated that miR-181a/b downregulation could be effective inameliorating retinal function across different IRD models with amutation/gene-independent mechanism, thus providing a novelpotential therapeutic strategy that deserves further developmenttoward clinical application in patients. miR- 181a/b-1 downregulation slows down retinal degeneration The transgenic line carrying the proline-347 to serine (P347S) muta-tion in the Rhodopsin (RHO) protein is a model for autosomal domi-nant (AD) RP. These animals show a reduction in electroretinogram(ERG) amplitudes that correlate with the extent of PR loss (Li et al,  ). The P347S mutation leads to mis-trafficking of the RHO protein with defective vectorial transport of post-Golgi vesicles, whichmostly fail in reaching the nascent disks of the PR outer segment(OS) (Li et al, ; Greenwald et al, ) and is therefore mislocalized to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the transgenic mouseretina (Chadderton et al, ; Marrocco et al, ; Patrizi et al,  ). A reduced ERG response in RHO- P347S mice (from now onward termed P347S) can be observed at postnatal day (p) 30 and,albeit severely impaired, can be recorded up to p70 90. To study the effect of miR-181a/b inactivation on RP progression, we crossedmiR-181a /b-1 +//C0(Henao-Mejia et al, ; Indrieri et al, ) with P347S+/+mice to obtain, in the same litters, P347S+//C0/miR-181a/ b-1+/+and P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals, termed P347S and P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0, respectively (see Materials and Methods). Most of the analyzed miR-181a/b targets (i.e., Cox11 ,Erk2, Mcl1 , Bcl2,Nrf1,Coq10b ,Atg5 ,Xiap ,Pgc1a ,Park2 , and Prdx3 ) displayed increased transcript levels in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0versus P347S eyes, as measured by quantitative (q)RT PCR (Fig 1A). Cell death was analyzed in the retinas of P347S and P347S/miR181a/b-1+//C0animals by active caspase-3 staining and TUNEL assays at p30. A significant decrease of cell death in the ONL of P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0with respect to P347S was observed (Fig 1BG). At the same time point, we also detected a significant improvement of 2of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et alERG responses (both a-waves and b-waves) registered in scotopic conditions in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0compared with P347S eyes (Fig 2AC ). Although we did not observe significant differences in ONL thickness at p30 (Fig EV1A D), the expression of the PR markersRhodopsin (Fig 2DF0), C-Arrestin (Fig 2GI0), and Recoverin (Fig EV1E H) was better preserved in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0eyes as compared with P347S controls. In particular, we noticed amelio-ration of: (i) Rhodopsin distribution, which displayed a lower extentof retainment in the ONL (Fig 2DF 0and P); (ii) structure of cone Figure 1. miR- 181a/b-1downregulation slows down retinal degeneration in P 347S mice at p 30.

Notably, the beneficial effect of miR-181a/b downregulation was still detectable at later time points (p90), when we observedstatistically significant preservation of b-wave ERG response(Fig 3AC ), with amelioration of PR markers expression (Fig 3D L) and a slight increase in ONL thickness (Fig 3M). We observed a statistically significant increase in photopic a-waves ampli-tudes suggesting that the PRs with preserved functionality aremostly cones at this late time point. We also decided to test thespatial frequency threshold of vision (i.e., visual acuity expressedin cycles/degree), determined by measuring the optokineticresponse (OKR). P347S animals displayed a dramatic impair-ment of OKR response, in agreement with previous reports (Yuet al, ). Conversely, P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0animals showed a significant amelioration of OKR response at the same stage(Fig 3N). Taken together, these results indicate that miR-181a/b downregulation improves retinal function and slows down retina degenera-tion in P347S mice.

However, mitochondria defects have not been reported in the P347S model to date.

We therefore investigated in further details the putative mitochondrial defects in the P347S retina. EManalysis highlighted a fragmented mitochondrial morphology at p12and p30 in PRs (Fig 4B, C and E ; see Materials and Methods section and Appendix Figs S1andS2for further details). The extent of fragmentation was quantified by measuring the mitochondrial perime-ter, which is significantly decreased in P347S animals comparedwith WT mice at both time points (Fig 4G). Although we did not observe any significant variation in the total number of mitochon-dria (Fig 4H), we found a strong reduction in mitochondrial area in P347S versus WT PRs at p30, suggesting a decrease in mitochon-drial mass during retinal degeneration progression (Fig 4I). This observation was further confirmed by the decrease in mitochondrialproteins in P347S retinas as assessed by immunofluorescence ofcitrate synthase (CS) at p12 and p30 (Fig EV2A B 0, D and D0, red triangles) and by Western blot (WB) for the mitochondrial proteinsAtp5A, Uqcrc2, Mtco1, Sdhb, NdufB8, and CS (Fig EV2F and G ). Interestingly, the reduction of miR-181a/b levels in P347S/miR181a/b-1 +//C0mice led to an amelioration of CS staining (Fig EV2C, C0, E and E0), an increase in mitochondrial proteins (Fig EV2F and G) and an amelioration of the mitochondrial fragmentation phenotype at p30 (Fig 4D, F and G ). Accordingly, WB analysis also revealed significantly increased levels of Drp1 (Fig 5A and B ) and a trend of increased levels of Fis1 (Fig EV2H and I ), two key regulators of mitochondrial fission, in P347S retinas, while no significantvariation was observed for Opa1 and Mfn1/2, which are key regula-tors of mitochondrial fusion (Fig EV2H and I ). We therefore hypothesized that the increase of Drp1 and Fis1 could underlies themitochondrial fragmentation in P347S PRs. Interestingly, in P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0retinas, we observed that the Drp1 protein levels were decreased with respect to the P347S retina (Fig 5A and B ). Notably, downregulation of the Drp1 protein correlates with adecrease in Drp1 transcript levels in the eyes of P347S/miR-181a/ b-1 +//C0with respect to those found in P347S animals (Fig 5C). These data suggest that the partial rescue of Drp1 protein amounts likelyoccurs at the transcript level. It was recently reported that Drp1 transcription can be negatively modulated by IRF1 (Huang et al,  ), a downstream effector of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Guschin et al, ; Kojima et al, ; Yamanaka et al, ; Sato et al,  ; Garcia-Diaz et al, ). We thus hypothesized that the decrease in Drp1 transcript and protein levels could be mediated by miR-181a/b targeting of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Signal transduc-ers and activators of transcription (STATs) constitute a family oftranscription factors that mediate a wide variety of biological func-tions in the nervous systems. STAT activation is mediated by JAKfamily members and is induced in response to multiple cytokinesand growth factors that are released after injury in neuronal tissues. STAT family members can play different roles. In particular, STAT3is emerging as a key effector of neuronal survival by inducing theexpression of neuroprotective genes (Dziennis & Alkayed,  ). STAT3 augmentation was previously shown to significantly enhancePR survival and improve retinal electrophysiology in P347S mice(Jiang et al, ). Both Jak2 and Stat3 have been reported to be direct targets of miR-181a/b (Qu et al, ; Lai et al, ). We observed, by qRT PCR, that Jak2 and Stat3 transcripts are upregulated in P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0with respect to P347S eyes(Fig 5D). This upregulation is accompanied by an increase in both STAT3 and of Phospho(p)-705-STAT3 protein levels (Fig EV3A and B). Immunofluorescence analysis of the STAT3 protein revealed that the increase in P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0occurs in all retinal layers, including the ONL (Fig EV3C G). The phosphorylation at position 705 is mainly mediated by JAK2 and leads to the translocation ofSTAT3 to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of severalpro-survival genes (Dziennis & Alkayed,  ; Jiang et al, ). Consistently, we detected, by qRT PCR, increased transcript levels of several p-705-STAT3 downstream targets, among which Irf1(Lee et al, ; Walch-R uckheim et al, ) (Fig EV3H ), while we did not observe any statistically significant variation of p-727-STAT3(Fig EV3A and B ), a modification that mediates STAT3 translocation to mitochondria (Wegrzyn et al, ; Zhang et al, ). To verify whether the upregulation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway mediates, viaIrf1, Drp1 downregulation in P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0eyes, we treated P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0eyes with a JAK2 inhibitor (FEDRATINIB) in ex-vivo conditions. Eight hours of treatment led to a decrease of p-705-STAT3 as determined by WB (Fig EV3I and J ). We observed that the FEDRATINIB treatment dramatically reducesIrf1 transcript levels (Fig 5E) and increases Drp1 transcript and Drp1protein levels (Fig 5A, E and F ) in P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0as compared with DMSO only treated eyes. These data confirm thatdownregulation of miR-181a/b rescues Drp1 levels by enhancingthe JAK2/STAT3/IRF1 pathway. AAV2/8-Sponge-miR- 181a/b delivery downregulates miR- 181a/b activity and ameliorates the retinal phenotype of P347 S mice Based on the evidence that the heterozygous genetic inactivation of the miR-181a/b-1 locus exerts a beneficial effect in the P347S model(Figs 14), we decided to further explore the therapeutic potential of miR-181a/b silencing by using an AAV-mediated delivery to theretina of a miRNA sponge. MiRNA sponges are RNA molecules withtandemly repeated miRNA antisense sequences (miRNA bindingsites, MBS) that can sequester miRNAs from their endogenous tar-gets resulting in their long-term silencing in vivo (Ebert & Sharp,  ). We previously generated miR-181a/b sponges and tested their efficacy in vitro (Barbato et al, ). To achieve long-term loss-of-function of miR-181a/b in vivo , we produced AAV2/8 vectors expressing the miR-181a/b sponge construct (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b) and a control (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP).To demonstrate efficacy of the miR-181a/b Sponge in the retina, weinjected the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b vector in thesubretinal space of WT mice at p20. As controls, the contralateraleyes were injected with the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP vector. The AAV2/8serotype efficiently transduces RPE, PRs, and M uller glia cells upon subretinal administration in several species, including mice (Alloccaet al, ). Accordingly, we observed a good transduction of RPE, PRs, and M uller glia cells 3 weeks after subretinal administration of both AAV2/8.CMV.GFP and AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b(Appendix Fig S3AF). Subretinal injection at p4 of AAV2/ 8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b in WT retina does not alter ERGresponses at p30 with respect to AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected retinas(Appendix Fig S3G and H). Moreover, we observed, by qRT PCR, significantly increased levels of miR-181a/b mRNA targets in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b versus AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injectedretinas (Appendix Fig S3I). 6of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et alFigure 4. miR- 181a/b-1downregulation improves the mitochondrial phenotype in the retina of P 347S mice.

Toward that goal, we also generated AAV constructsdriving Sponge-miR-181a/b expression either in the RPE or in therod PRs using cell type-specific promoters. To specifically overex-press sponge-miR-181a/b in rod PRs, we prepared an expression Figure 5. 8of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et alcassette in which the GFP-sponge-miR-181a/b is under the control of the human RHO promoter (Botta et al, ) (AAV2/8.RHO.GFPSponge-miR-181a/b). For the RPE-specific overexpression, we usedthe promoter of the human VMD2 gene (Esumi et al, ) (AAV2/ 8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b). Vectors driving the expressionof GFP under the control of the same promoters (AAV2/8.RHO.GFPand AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP) were used as controls and injected in thecontralateral eyes. We tested the above-described constructs inP347S animals (Appendix Fig S3JO). The animals were subretinally injected at p4, and their retinas were analyzed at p30 and p70.We observed a significant increase in b-wave ERG responses, regis-tered under scotopic conditions, at both time points in P347S eyesinjected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b and in eyesinjected with AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b, comparedwith the corresponding control-injected eyes (Fig 6AC ). Conversely, we did not observe any significant effect when using theAAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b (Fig 6AC). These results suggest that miR-181a/b silencing restricted only to the RPE is notsufficient to exert a protective effect in P347S mice. Although notsignificant, we observed a trend of amelioration, both at p30 and atp70, in the a-waves registered in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected P347S eyes versus the corresponding controls(Fig EV4A C). Cryosections of P347S AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-SpongemiR-181a/b- and AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injectedretinas were analyzed at p30 and p70. We detected with both con-structs, and at both time points, improved PR marker expression,observing greater effect when using the CMV promoter (Fig 6DG 0, LO0, T and U; please compare panels D and E, white arrowheads). Moreover, we observed amelioration of C-Arrestin staining in theOS (Fig 6HK 0,PS0, T and U; white arrowheads) and of Recoverin staining at p70 (Appendix Fig S4AI). We also evaluated the extent of photoreceptor cell death at p30, by TUNEL assays. We observed adecrease in TUNEL-positive cells per injected area (GFP-positivearea) in the ONL of AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injectedeyes versus those injected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP (Fig EV4DH , black triangles). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showedan amelioration of CS staining in the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected IS with respect to the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected ones (Fig EV4I L, red triangles), suggesting that SpongemiR-181a/b-treatment induces an amelioration of the mitochondrialphenotype similar to what we observed in the genetic miR-181a/bdownregulation model (Fig EV2D E 0). To assess whether miR-181a/ b downregulation exerts a beneficial effect also when delivered atlater time points, in a fully differentiated retina, we injected P347Smice at p12/p14 using both AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/band AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b along with their corre-sponding control vectors. Such time points of intervention representmore disease-relevant stages. Following subretinal injection at p12/p14, we recorded a trend of improved ERG responses (b-waves) atp30 and p70 (Appendix Fig S5AC and M O), with a statistically significant effect at p30 (Appendix Fig S5B), and amelioration of PR markers expression in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes versus the corresponding control eyes, moreevident at p30 (Appendix Fig S5DE 0,HI0and L) than at p70 (Appendix Fig S5PQ0,TU0and X; white arrowheads). A similar trend was also observed in AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/banimals subretinally injected at p12/p14 and analyzed at p30 andp70, albeit a statistical significance in ERG results was not obtained(Appendix Fig S5AC and M O), and with lower effects on PR marker expression at both p30 and p70 (Appendix Fig S5FG 0,JL, RS0and V X; white arrowheads). The above data indicate that AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Spongemediated miR-181a/b inhibition ameliorates the P347S retinal phe-notype also when administered after the onset of degeneration. Theobservation of a stronger effect obtained with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b versus AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/binjections, particularly following injections at later time points, indi-cates that although the effect of miR-181a/b downregulation in theP347S model has a PR cell autonomous component, it may probablyinvolve other retinal cell types. AAV2/8-Sponge-miR- 181a/b delivery ameliorates the retinal Based on the evidence that AAV2/8-Sponge-miR-181a/b delivery exerted a beneficial effect in the retina of P347S mice, we decided toinvestigate whether this strategy could be extended to other IRDmodels to evaluate the mutation(gene)-independent value of thisapproach. To achieve this goal, we tested the AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b, which yielded the most evident effect in P347Smice, in the rd10 mouse model. The latter is a model for autosomal recessive (AR) RP and carries a spontaneous mutation in the Pde6b gene that recapitulates the human condition (Chang et al, ). Pde6b encodes the bsubunit of the rod-specific phosphodiesterase (bPDE), which, when absent, results in toxic levels of intracellular 2+and PR cell death. We chose the rd10 model because it wasFigure 5. miR- 181a/b-1downregulation decreases Drp 1levels via regulation of the Jak 2/Stat3 pathway.

Moreover, rd10 animals display, similar to P347S mice (Jiang et al, ), increased levels of the STAT3 protein in the degenerating retina (Ly et al, ; Roche et al, ).Rd10 mice show a severely impaired ERG response and a dramatically reduced ONLthickness at p30 (Chang et al, ). The animals were subretinally injected with AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b in one eye andthe corresponding control vector (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP) in the con-tralateral eye, at p4 or p10. As expected, the ONL thickness of rd10 AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected retinas was significantly reduced at p30,because of progressive retinal degeneration. Conversely, the ONLthickness was higher at p30 in Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected rd10 retinas following both injection time points (Fig 7AH 0). The p4injected retinas also showed enhanced expression of Rhodopsin(Fig 7AB 0and I), C-Arrestin (Fig 7EF0and I), and Recoverin (Fig EV5A E). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis showed an amelioration of CS staining in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes versus AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected controls(Fig EV5F I, red triangles). The rd10 mouse model shows a rapid and severe degeneration (Chang et al, ); therefore, ERG responses were severely impaired (Fig EV5J O), as expected, and we could observe only a significant amelioration of b-waveresponses in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b p4-injected Figure 7.

We thus decided to carry out visual functional assays that allow to detect slight differences in retinal function, such as pupillary light responses (PLR) and water maze tests. Retinalfunction tests based on PLR showed a significantly higher pupil con-striction in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected than inAAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injected rd10 eyes, at both 10 and 100 lux stimuli (about 23 and 25% more, respectively) (Fig 7J). In addition, the water maze test was used to analyze visual acuity as previouslyreported (Pang et al, ; Batabyal et al, ). This latter test revealed an improved visual function in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected animals that showed a significant reduction inthe latency to reach the platform with respect to control-injectedones (Fig 7K). These data indicate that miR-181a/b downregulation ameliorates retinal morphology and function across different IRDmodels. In this report, we show for the first time that miR-181a/b silencing,obtained both by genetic approaches and by administration to theretina of a specific miR-181 inhibitor (sponge), exerts a beneficialeffect in two very different models of IRDs, namely an autosomaldominant model, characterized by a gain-of-function mechanism(P347S) and an autosomal recessive model, caused by a loss-of-function mutation ( rd10). The AAV-mediated subretinal administration of a specific miR-181a/b silencing molecule provided us withthe proof of the translational potential of miR-181a/b downregula-tion as a mutation-independent therapeutic strategy for IRDs. Bene-ficial effects were obtained by interventions at early and later timepoints, when fully differentiated P347S and rd10 retinas already exhibit initial signs of degeneration. We observed amelioration ofvisual function and PR marker expression following injection atboth time points, although injections at later time point yielded amilder improvement. Nevertheless, the functional recovery by injec-tions carried out after disease onset is important, as it supports theclinical potential of the approach at stages of disease progressionrelevant for the amelioration of patients quality of life. The useddelivery route, vehicle (i.e., AAV vectors, serotype 2/8), and diseasestage at intervention (i.e., onset of retinal degeneration) are compat-ible with the development of a clinical protocol for human transla-tional purposes (e.g., subretinal delivery in patients) (Hudry &Vandenberghe,  ). We previously demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-181a/b, via genetic ablation of cluster-1, does notimpact on retina structure and function (Indrieri et al, ), and we now showed that the AAV subretinal delivery of the sponge,which results in effective decrease in miR-181a/b activity, does notalter ERG response providing further support to the safety of thisapproach. The data obtained with the use of the RHO andVMD2 promoters demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of miR-181a/b downreg-ulation in this IRD model is exerted, at least in part, through a PR-autonomous mechanism. The AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections did not produce any significant improvement ofERG responses, indicating that the miR-181a/b downregulationrestricted to the RPE is not sufficient to warrant a beneficial effect inthe retina of P347S animals. However, we cannot rule out the possi-bility that the VMD2 promoter does not yield the same level ofexpression as the CMV protomer in the RPE, and further experi-ments are needed to discriminate between the two possibilities. AAV2/8.RHO.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections determined anamelioration of the retinal phenotype, which, however, was less evi-dent and significant compared with that obtained after AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b injections. This indicates that theadministration of the Sponge-miR-181a/b under a ubiquitous pro-moter had a stronger effect, presumably through the pleiotropicaction of this miRNA on multiple cell targets that are transduced bythe 2/8 AAV serotype (e.g., rod and cone photoreceptors, M uller glia, and microglia). Besides neurons, the retina also contains a glialcomponent, represented by M uller cells, astrocytes, and the microglia, that orchestrate neuroinflammatory response, recovery frominjury and progression of disease. At present, we do not have anyevidence for a role of miR-181a/b in microglia modulation, but fur-ther studies are needed to gain insight into this issue. The hypothesis of a PR-autonomous action of miR-181a/b, although partial, is also corroborated by our EM data, whichrevealed an alteration of mitochondria morphology in P347S PRs. Although it was previously reported that the RHO- P347S mutation causes mis-trafficking of RHO proteins (Li et al, ; Greenwald et al, ), the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the retinal degeneration, as well as the final cell death mechanisms, are notfully elucidated in this model. Here, we describe, for the first time, amitochondrial phenotype in P347S mice that can be detected asearly as p12, thus supporting its early involvement in disease patho-genesis. This model displays (i) transcriptome changes pointing tomitochondrial dysfunction and (ii) mitochondrial fragmentation. The latter results correlate with an increase in Drp1 and Fis1 proteinlevels. These two proteins are key regulators of mitochondrial fis-sion, and therefore, their upregulation may explain the mitochon-drial fragmentation phenotype. MiR-181a/b have already beendemonstrated to regulate key genes involved in mitochondrial bio-genesis and function (Indrieri et al, ; Barbato et al, ). Here, we show that their downregulation rescues the mitochondrial frag-mentation phenotype of P347S PRs, with a concomitant ameliora-tion of mitochondrial proteins and a decrease in Drp1 protein levels,mediated by miR-181a/b regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. The activation of the latter pathway leads to the increase in severaltarget genes, involved in pro-survival function. Interestingly, it waspreviously demonstrated that endogenous Stat3 expression was sig-nificantly increased in mutant PRs from three unrelated IRD models[P347S, Prph2 rds/ +(Jiang et al, ), and rd10 mice (Ly et al,  ; Roche et al, )], and significantly improves mutant PR survival and retinal electrophysiology (Jiang et al, ). Although the mechanism underlying the protective effect of Stat3 in IRDs remainsto be defined (Jiang et al, ), it is tempting to speculate that the p705-Stat3 downstream genes, which are upregulated in our modelafter miR-181a/b-1 inactivation (Fig EV3H ), may be responsible for the Stat3-dependent effect on mutant PR survival and could have animpact on the decrease in cell death detected. We report here that the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway has an impact on the mitochondrial dynamics related protein Drp1,whose imbalance is often associated with neuronal cell death (Kimet al, ; Viringipurampeer et al, ; Oliver & Reddy,  ). In cells, the equilibrium between small-fragmented mitochondria andlong interconnected mitochondrial networks is essential to ensuremitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival. This equilibrium is 12of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et almaintained by the proper balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, which guarantee the ever-changing dynamicstate of mitochondria, where mitochondrial networks are constantlyelongating and dividing (Twig & Shirihai,  ; Calo et al, ; Balog et al, ; Anzell et al, ). Increased mitochondrial fission and reduced fusion are prominent features in aging and inmany neurological diseases (Oliver & Reddy,  ). The master mediator of fission is Drp1, whose role is fundamental in maintain-ing balance in mitochondrial dynamics, primarily as a mitochondrialfission factor, but when downregulated, indirectly promotes fusion. In this respect, we observed mitochondria elongation rescue anddecreased level of Drp1 in the P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0retina, mediated by the increase in the JAK2/STAT3/IRF1 pathway, thus unveil-ing a novel mechanism of JAK2/STAT3 regulation of mitochondrialdynamics. We previously demonstrated that miR-181a/b control mitochondrial turnover by acting on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy inthe retina of mouse models of LHON (Indrieri et al, ). We now report that these miRNAs also act on mitochondrial fission/fusionbalance as revealed by the analysis of an autosomal dominantmouse model of RP. Altogether these findings reveal that miR-181a/b have a pervasive role in the modulation of mitochondrial activi-ties. Moreover, our results highlight that miR-181a/b downregula-tion/silencing has a protective effect in clinically and geneticallydifferent types of retinal neurodegenerative diseases, including amitochondrial disease model (Indrieri et al, ), an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive IRD models. These data sup-port the potential of miR-181a/b modulation as a gene/mutation-independent therapeutic approach to slow down the progression ofa vast class of retinal diseases with either primary or secondarymitochondrial involvement, which affect both the outer and theinner retina. This strategy can represent a therapeutic agent thatdampens disease-amplifying processes, thus also supporting gene-specific replacement approaches, and may also be relevant for non-mendelian, multifactorial forms of retinopathies associated withmitochondrial dysfunction, such as age-related macular degenera-tion or diabetic retinopathy, although further research efforts areneeded to address this latter perspective. All studies on mice were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal research (ARRIVE guidelines) andapproved by the Italian Ministry of Health; Department of PublicHealth, Animal Health, Nutrition and Food Safety in accordance withthe law on animal experimentation (article 7; D.L. 116/92; protocolnumber: 254/-PR). All animal treatments were reviewed andapproved in advance by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the Tele-thon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (Pozzuoli, Italy). Mice weremaintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF)-like conditions at theTIGEM Animal Facility. Examinations are conducted periodically onthe animals stored in the establishment to confirm they are not con-taminated with pathogens of infectious diseases. Same sex litter mateswere housed together in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) withmaximum four mice per cage. All mice were maintained on a regular12/12-h light/dark cycle, temperature of 20 24C, and humidity of 5465%, with ad libitum access to food and water. Feeding control and sanitary control are carried out under the supervision of a com-mittee that include veterinarians in the establishment. All materials,including IVCs, lids, feeders, bottles, bedding, and water, were auto-claved before use. Both male and female animals were used in allexperiments. For subretinal injections in the RHO- P347S background, pups were obtained by crossing the RHO- P347S +/+transgenic (A1 line) (Liet al, ) with C57BL/6J mice (JAX /C226Mice Strain, Charles Rivers Laboratories, Strain Code 632), to obtain the P347S+//C0mice (Mussolino et al, ;B o t t a et al, , ; Karali et al, ). Please note that we excluded the presence of the rd8allele in the above mice. TheRHO- P347S+/+(A1 line) is in the 129 S2/SvHsd (Harlan, Huntington, UK) background and was obtained from the laboratory of Dr.Jane G. Farrar (Loscher et al, ;C h a d d e r t o n et al, ; Palfi et al,  ), and was maintained by crossing A1 P347S +/+with A1 P347S+/+. For the analysis of miR-181a/b genetic decrease in RHO- P347S background, we crossed RHO-P347S+/+transgenic (Li et al, ) with miR-181a/b-1+//C0(Henao-Mejia et al, ; Indrieri et al, ), obtaining in the same litters P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+/+, simply termed P347S, and P347S+//C0/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals, termed P347S/ miR-181a/b-1+//C0. Please note that all the analyzed P347S and P347S/miR-181a/b-1+//C0animals were obtained from the same litters and sacrificed at the same time. Pde6brd10(rd10) mice were kindly provided by Dr. Mathias Seeliger (Division of Ocular Neurodegenera-tion, Centre for Ophthalmology, Institute for Ophthalmic Research). Optic cup samples were processed in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN). Total RNA from optic cup samples was extracted using the RNeasyextraction kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturers instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR For quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT PCR) experiments, cDNAs were generated using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturers instruc-tions. Primers for qRT PCR reactions were designed to span two different exons to avoid genomic DNA amplification using in silico tools ( ) to predict their melting temperature ( T m) and to avoid the possibility of selfannealing or primer dimerization. The specificity of the designedprimers was tested in silico using the BLAT or BLAST tool in Genome Browser ( https://genome.ucsc.edu/ ) or Ensembl ( http:// www.ensembl.org/index.html ). Primers were tested as described (Bustin et al, ). Primer sequences are reported in Appendix Table S1. Quantification data, obtained in qRT PCR reactions on cDNAs obtained from different treatments, are expressed interms of cycle thresholds (Ct). The HPRT and GAPDH genes were used as endogenous reference controls for experiments. The Ct val-ues were averaged for each in-plate technical triplicate. The aver-aged Ct was normalized as difference in Ct values ( DCt) between the analyzed mRNAs and each reference gene in each sample ana-lyzed. The DCt values of each sample were then normalized with respect to the DCt values of the control ( DDCt). The variation was reported as fold change (2 /C0DDCt). Each plate was performed in /C2112022 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | 13of19Sabrina Carrella et al EMBO Molecular Medicineduplicate, and all the results are shown as means /C6SEM of at least three independent biological assays. Protein isolation and Western blotting (WB) Optic cup samples for total protein extraction were homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail 100 (Sigma) and phosSTOP-Easypack phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche).Protein extract concentrations were determined using the Bio-Radprotein assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 30 lg protein from each sample was loaded in SDS polyacrylamide gels. For WB, gels were electroblotted onto PVDF filters (Millipore) and sequentially immunos-tained with the following primary antibodies: anti-Atp5A, anti-Uqcrc2, anti-Mtco1, anti-Sdhb, anti-NdufB8 (Abcam, Total OXPHOSRodent WB Antibody Cocktail ab110413, 1:250); anti-Drp1 (Abcam,ab184247; 1:1,000); anti-TTC11/Fis1 (Abcam, ab229969; 1:1,000);anti-Opa1 (BD Biosciences, 612607; 1:1,000); anti-Mfn1 (Abcam,ab57602; 1:200); anti-Mfn2 (Abcam, ab56889, 1:1,000); anti-CitrateSynthase (Abcam, ab9660, 1:1,000); anti-Stat3 (Cell Signaling,ab30835, 1:1,000); anti-p507-Stat3 (Cell signaling, ab4113, 1:1,000);anti-p727-Stat3 (Cell Signaling, ab9134, 1:1,000); anti-p115 (SantaCruz, sc-48363, 1:3,000); anti-Gapdh (Santa Cruz sc-32233,1:3,000). Proteins of interest were detected with horseradishperoxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody(1:3,000, GE Healthcare) visualized with the Luminata Crescendosubstrate (Millipore) or the Super Signal West Femto substrate(Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturers protocol. WBimages were acquired using the Chemidoc-lt imaging system (UVP),and band intensity was calculated using the ImageJ software. Thesignals for each protein staining were quantified and then normal-ized for Gapdh or p115 in the same sample (internal normalization).These normalized values were then compared with the values in thecontrol sample. Only bands on the same blot were compared. Theaverage of the normalized values from three different biologicalreplicates is reported as the relative fold change. For TUNEL assay, mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and cryosectioned. TUNELassay was performed using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) as described (Indrieri et al, ). Only sections in which the optic nerve was contained were analyzed with a Leica DM-5500 micro-scope, and TUNEL-positive cells were manually counted and nor-malized per section. The TUNEL count was performed on threeeyes/genotype on at least six sections/eye that contain the opticnerve. For the analysis of photoreceptor cell death in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b-injected eyes ( N=4; four sections/ eye that contain the optic nerve) and in AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-injectedones ( N=3; four sections/eye that contain the optic nerve), only GFP-positive areas were taken into account for the count of TUNEL-positive cells, and the data were normalized per area. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis For immunofluorescence analysis, mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, andcryosectioned. Fourteen-micrometer cryosections was collected onslides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Sectionswere permeabilized by incubation with 1% NP40 for 15 min forRhodopsin and C-Arrestin immunostaining, or by boiling in sodiumcitrate buffer (0.1 M citric acid, 0.1 M sodium citrate in water) forCaspase 3 active staining or in citrate buffer (0.01 M citric acid inwater) for citrate synthase and Stat3 staining. After 1-min boiling,the slides were cooled down at room temperature. The followingprimary antibodies were incubated overnight: anti-Rhodopsin(Abcam, ab3267, 1:5,000); anti-C-Arrestin (Millipore, 1:1,000); anti-Recoverin (Sigma-Aldrich, AB5585, 1:500); anti-Citrate Synthase(Abcam, ab9660, 1:500); anti-Stat3 (Cell Signaling, ab30835, 1:100);anti-Caspase 3 active (R&D System, AF385, 1:1,000). Sections werethen incubated with the Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:1,000;Invitrogen). Phalloidin staining was performed washing cryosec-tions three times in PTW1 , blocking for 1 h in PTW1 +10% FBS and then sections were incubated for 20 min with Phalloidin (Invit-rogen Alexa Fluor 568). For PNA staining, cryosections werewashed three times with PBS1 . The slides were incubated over night with (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) (L7381,Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (VectorLaboratories). All the immunofluorescence stainings were acquiredusing a Zeiss LSM700 Confocal, with the exception of the CitrateSynthase staining that was acquired through a Zeiss LSM800 Confo-cal. Only sections in which the optic nerve was contained were usedand two images from each section were photographed in compara-ble regions equidistant from the optic nerve head. The fluorescentimages were converted to grayscale and normalized to backgroundstaining, using ImageJ. Quantification of each staining reactivitywas measured as mean values to define fluorescence signal intensity(IntDen/Area) and as the area occupied by fluorescent-labeling ineach region of interest. Active-caspase 3-positive cells count Immunostained sections for Active-casp3, in which the optic nerve was contained, were analyzed with a Leica DM-5500 microscopeand positive cells were manually counted and normalized per sec-tion. The analysis was performed on 4 6 eyes/genotype on at least eight sections/eye that contain the optic nerve. Mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT and cryosectioned. Fourteen-micrometer cryosec-tions was collected on slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pitts-burgh, PA), and washed three times with PTW1 . The sections were then incubated with DAPI in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)1for 10 min. Count of nuclei in ONL was performed on three eyes/genotype (at least two sections per eye) at p30. Only sectionsin which the optic nerve was contained were used, and two imagesfrom each section were photographed under a Leica DM-5500microscope, with the objective Leica /0.17/D, HCX PL FLUOTAR, 40/0.75 that acquires an area of 0.31 mm 2, in comparable regions equidistant from the optic nerve head (Barbato et al, ; Karali et al, ; Ciampi et al, ; Intartaglia et al, ). The acquired images were used for nuclei counts. DAPI-positive nuclei in ONLwere count manually using ImageJ program and normalized perarea. On the same images, the ONL thickness was manually 14of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et almeasured using ImageJ program, by measuring the distance between the Henles fiber layer (HFL) and the outer limiting mem-brane (OLM). The same analysis was performed at p90 on N3 eyes/genotype (at least two sections per eye). Electron microscopy, outer segment (OS) length analysis and Mice, at p12 and p30, were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 1% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 200 mM Hepes Buffer, pH 7.3through the heart. Eyes were removed, and under a dissectionmicroscope, the eyeball was cut along the line between the anteriorand posterior chambers of the eye using Spring scissors (FineScience Tools). Lens were removed and the retina and RPE was leftfor 1 h in the described fixative solution. Specimens of retina +RPE were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embeddedin epoxy resin. Retina samples were cut on ultramicrotome LEICAEM UC7 and collected on the single slot oval grids and analyzedwith FEI electron microscope. Only tissue sections in which thesagittal orientation of the connecting cilium (cc) was visible werechosen, as shown in Appendix Fig S1. We analyzed two eyes/genotype on at least 10 images per eye, for a total number of OS mea-sured of around 200 OS for the P347S and 150 OS for the P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0. These data are represented as mean /C6SEM (Standard Error of the Mean). The researchers in charge of producing theTEM images were blind to the genotypes of the animals. The mitochondrial characterization was performed for all mitochondria located within the entire inner segment (IS), from theouter limiting membrane to the outer segment (OS) with nascentdisks (see Appendix Fig S2), observing that the changes in shape and size that we report are independent from localization within theIS. We analyzed mitochondrial number, perimeter, and area on sev-eral TEM images derived from two eyes/genotypes each time point,for a total number of images analyzed of 22/genotype for each timepoint of analysis. Mitochondrial number was determined using FEIsoftware. Mitochondrial surface area and perimeter were analyzedon the same images using the iTEM software, and these data arerepresented normalized per field, as previously reported (Costaet al, ; Naon et al, ; Quintana-Cabrera et al, ; Indrieri et al, ; Tsakiri et al, ; Xia et al, ; Ozaki et al, ; Anastasia et al, ; Mirra et al, ). The researchers in charge of producing the TEM images were blind to the genotypes of theanimals. Mice were dark reared for 3 h and anesthetized. Flash ERGs were evoked by 10-ms light flashes generated through a Ganzfeld stimula-tor (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Florence, Italy) and reg-istered as previously described (Botta et al, ; Indrieri et al,  ) ERGs and b-wave thresholds were assessed using the following protocol. Eyes were stimulated with light flashes increasing from/C05.2 to +1.3 log cd *s/m 2(which correspond to 1 10/C05.2to 20.0 cd *s/m2) in scotopic conditions. For ERG analysis in scotopic conditions, the responses evoked by 11 stimuli (from /C05.2 to +1.3 log cd *s/m2) with an interval of 0.6 log unit were considered. To minimize the noise, three ERG responses were averaged at each 0.6log unit stimulus from /C05.2 to 0.0 log cd *s/m 2while one ERGresponse was considered for higher stimuli (from 0.0 to +1.3 log cd*s/m2). a- and b-waves amplitudes recorded in scotopic conditions were plotted as a function of increasing light intensity (from/C04t o +1.3 log cd *s/m 2). The photopic ERG was recorded after the scotopic session by stimulating the eye with ten 10 ms flashes of20.0 cd *s/m 2over a constant background illumination of 50 cd/m2. Visual acuity of mice was assessed by using the Optomotor system (OptoMotry; Cerebral Mechanics) as previously described (Indrieriet al, ). Briefly, the OptoMotry machine (CerebralMechanics Inc.) is constituted by a plexiglass box [39 3932.5 cm (LWH)] with rectangular openings [33.5 26.5 cm (W H)] on each wall painted flat white on the inside (screens). Inside thebox, a platform is positioned 13 cm above the floor by securing awhite Plexiglas disk (diameter, 5.3 cm). Above and below thescreens, there are two mirrors and a camera at the top that allowsone to follow the behavior of the animal. The computer program(OptoMotry; CerebralMechanics, Lethbride, Alberta, Canada) wasused to control the rotation speed and the geometry of the stimuli aswell as the spatial frequency and contrast of the stimuli. Analyseshave been conducted twice, at two different time points (p40 andp90), by increasing the spatial frequency for each direction of rota-tion (right/left), after an initial trial of 10 min. The maximum spa-tial frequency that the animal is able to perceive is recorded as athreshold of visual acuity and reported in the graph as cycles/degreeon the y-axis. Pupillary light responses from rd10 mice were recorded in dark condition using the TRC-50IX retinal camera connected to a chargecoupled device NikonD1H digital camera (Topcon Biomedical Sys-tems), as previously described (Tornabene et al, ). Briefly, mice were exposed to 10 lux light-stimuli for approximately 10 s and onepicture per eye was acquired using the IMAGEnet software (TopconBiomedical Systems). For each eye, the pupil diameter was normal-ized to the eye diameter (from temporal to nasal side). We used a modified version of the visual water maze task (Marrocco et al, ) consisting of a circular tank of 1.4-m diameter gray metal, high 40 cm. A visible black platform was 13 cm high,protruding 1 cm above the water (21 /C62C) that was made white with natural color and was positioned in a well-lit room. The northsite the pool contained a divisor panel. Across trials, the platformwas randomly located on the right and left side equidistant from thedivisor. The animal was always released from the south quadrant,and the latency to reach the platform was recorded by using thevideo tracking AnyMaze (Stoelting, USA). Black curtains were posi-tioned around the pool to limit distal cues; the access to distal cueswas prevented by the wall of the pool. To acclimatize the mice tothe platform, the training started with the animal positioned on theplatform for 60 s, before the first training session was administered. Training consisted of two sessions per day of six trials for two 2 con-secutive days. Every two consecutive trials animals rested for /C2112022 The Authors EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | 15of19Sabrina Carrella et al EMBO Molecular Medicine10 min within sessions. The position of the platform is randomly displaced every two trials. Intersession interval was about. Subjectswere given up to 120 s to escape during each trial; if they did notescape within the allotted time, they were gently guided to the plat-form and their escape time was recorded as this maximum. All miceremained on the platform between trials, then after each block theywere towel-dried, and transferred to their home cages under warmair. Behavioral data were acquired with a latency to reach the plat-form during the training trials. All measurements were monitoredby a video camera. P347S and P347S/miR-181a/b-1 +//C0animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, following the institutions guidelines, at p30. Eyes were removed quickly using Dumonts forceps #5 and put in CO2-independent medium Gibco (18045-054). Under a dissection microscope, the eyeball was opened and cut along the line betweenthe anterior and posterior chambers of the eye using Spring scissors(Fine Science Tools). Lens were removed and the retina and RPE,attached in the inferior part of the eyeball, was dissected out using#5 forceps and flat-mounted retina/RPE was placed in a new dishcontaining Dulbeccos modified eagle medium supplemented with10% FBS (Euroclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The ex vivo retinas were treated with the JAK2 inhibitor FEDRATINIB(SAR302503, TG101348; Selleckchem) 100 lM for 8 h. Control retinas were treated with DMSO. Sponge design, construct, and AAV preparation We previously generated miR-181a/b sponge construct (Barbato et al,  ). The sequence is covered by the patent application miR-181 inhibitors and uses thereof (WO2019202162A1). MiR-181a/b sponge was cloned in a vector, containing an expression cassette, into the 3 UTR of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, under the con-trol of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) constitutive promoter. To specifi-cally overexpress sponge-miR-181a/b in rod PRs, we prepared anexpression cassette in which the GFP-sponge-miR-181a/b is under thecontrol of the human RHO promoter (Botta et al, ), and for the RPE-specific overexpression, we used the promoter of the humanVMD2 gene (Esumi et al, ). We generated AAV2/8 vectors expressing sponge constructs to achieve long-term loss-of-functionof miR-181a/b in vivo (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b; AAV2/8.RHO.GFP- Sponge-miR-181a/b; AAV2/8.VMD2.GFP-Sponge-miR-181a/b). Vectors, driving the expression of GFP under the controlof the same promoters (AAV2/8.CMV.GFP; AAV2/8.RHO.GFP andAAV2/8.VMD2.GFP), were used as controls. Recombinant AAV2/8viruses were produced by the TIGEM Vector Core as reported(Hildinger et al, ;D o r i a et al, ). Plasmids used for AAV vector production are as follows: the pAd helper plasmid that contains the adenovirus E2A, E4, and VA RNAhelper genes (Zhang et al,  ); the pAAV2/8 (Gao et al,  )p a c k - aging plasmid with AAV rep2 and cap8 genes; the pAAV2.1 plasmidthat contains the expression cassette flanked by two identical invertedterminal repeats (ITRs), the ampicillin resistance and the bovinegrowth hormone polyadenylation signal (bGH) (Auricchio et al, ). Adeno-associated viral vectors were produced by triple transfection of HEK293 cells and were purified by two rounds of CsCl2gradients as already described (Doria et al, ). Physical titers [genome copies per milliliter (GC/ml)] of each viral preparationwere determined by averaging the titer achieved by dot-blot analysisand by PCR quantification using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems,Carlsbad, CA) (Doria et al, ). Surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Viral vectors were deliv-ered subretinally in the dorsal retinal areas via a trans-scleral tran-schoroidal approach (Liang et al, ). Eyes were injected with 1ll of AAV vector (specified in each ) containing a total of 110 13viral GCs. We excluded from our analysis samples that showed sign of injection-related damages, or eyes that turned out to be not properlyinjected as assessed from GFP expression analysis. The fluorescenceof eye fundi were acquired using a TRC-50IX retinal camera con-nected to a charge-coupled device NikonD1H digital camera (Top-con Biomedical Systems). Retinal sections were also analyzed todetermine the GFP expression and images acquired using the TILE-SCAN function at the Leica DM-5500 microscope. Animals were allocated to experimental and control groups randomly based on the appropriate genotype/conditions/treatments. Ingeneral, for each experiment, we used 3 animals per genotype, in order to obtain statistically suitable values. EM analysis, behavioral,and visual tests were carried out blinded. The number of experimen-tal replicates is indicated in each  legend. The normalityassumption was verified using Shapiro Wilk test. In all experiments, significance of differences between groups was evaluated byThe paper explained Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders affecting the retina characterized by photoreceptor cell death, pro-gressive loss of vision and blindness. Their high genetic heterogeneity,with over 250 different causative genes, represents an important limitation to the development of gene therapy approaches that can beapplied to a significant number of patients. Therefore, the establish-ment of therapeutic approaches for IRDs independent on the geneticdefect and aimed at slowing down disease progression represents ahigh priority. Here, we show that the inhibition in the retina of two small RNAmolecules, namely microRNAs miR- 181a and miR- 181b (miR- 181a/b), exerts a beneficial effect in vivo in different models of IRDs, by delaying disease progression. We also observed a beneficial effect on mitochondria defects observed in these IRDs models. Our findings represent a solid proof-of-principle of the usefulness ofmiR- 181a/b inhibition to counteract disease progression in IRDs and pave the way toward the development of an innovative gene-independent therapeutic strategy for retinal diseases with mitochon-drial involvement. 16of19 EMBO Molecular Medicine 14:e15941 | /C2112022 The AuthorsEMBO Molecular Medicine Sabrina Carrella et alone-tailed or two-tailed Students t-test when the comparison was between two experimental groups, one-way or two-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey analysis and/or Analysis of Deviance for Generalized Linear Model or Analysis of Deviance for Negative BinomialGeneralized Linear Model when the comparison was between morethan two experimental groups.

cases (4.8%). According to this a priori diagnosis based on the clinical and familial history of the patients, the main inheritance pattern in non-syndromic NON-RP and RP was recessive or sporadic, representing the 68% and 75% of cases, respectively. Autosomal dominant and X-linked forms accounted for 21% and 8% for NON-RP and 15% and 8% for RP , respectively (Fig. 2A-I). Families with no familiar data were annotated as unclassified. Non-syndromic RP represents the most common phenotype, representing 55.6% of families in our cohort. In the present cohort, 47% of the syndromic IRD index cases (270/577) suffered from USH2, followed by 17% USH1 (98/577), as well as other very rare syndromes like some atypical forms of Usher syndrome (3%; 16/577) and ciliopathies such as BBS or ALMS (16%; 90/577). A miscellanea of non-ciliopathic syndromes or unclassified symptoms were presented in 103 index cases. Molecular studies. Diagnostic yield. Genetic testing was performed in a total of 3951 index cases with available DNA611 (89.7% of the total cohort), including 1291 NON-RP ,  RP , and 577 syndromic IRD pa-3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports |  11:1526 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81093-y www.nature.com/scientificreports/tients as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The genetic analysis procedures evolved over time since novel genetic approaches were implemented in our laboratory. A definite genetic diagnosis was established for 53.2% (2100/3951) of cases. For NON-RP families, 754 out of 1291 (58.4%) obtained a genetic diagnosis; in RP the molecular cause was identified in 1038 out of  (49.8%). Similarly, 53.4% (308/577) of syndromic IRD families were genetically solved (Fig. 2B). Final inheritance pattern and reclassification of characterized families. The identification of the causative gene allowed us to reclassify the inheritance mode in 8.2% (146/1792) of the NON-RP and RP families, thus establishing the final inheritance type (Supplementary Table S2). A comparison between the a priori suspected inheritance based on the pedigree and the final inheritance suggested by the molecular diagnosis was performed in characterized NON-RP and RP families (Fig. 2C). As expected, most sporadic NON-RP (n = 378) and RP cases (n = 379) were confirmed as having AR inheritance after the genetic testing. The rest of the S cases were reclassified to AD (n = 43) and XL (n = 36) (Supplementary Table S2). Twenty-four cases (11 NON-RP and 13 RP) with an initial unknown mode of inheritance were classified as: AD (n = 5), AR (n = 16), and XL (n = 3) after the molecular testing. Gene landscape. In total, 1549 different pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were identified in 142 differ - ent genes. These included SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) and CNVs (Copy Number Variants). As showed in Figs. 3, 4, 5, there was a wide spectrum of genes implicated in IRD, 121 of them represented in 1% or less of the cohort. The 5 most frequent mutated genes were ABCA4, USH2A, RS1 (MIM: 300839), CRB1 (MIM: 604210) and RHO. In NON-RP families, PRPH2 (MIM: 179605), ABCA4 and RS1 were the most commonly mutated genes, explaining 42.2%, 82.7% and 93.3% of the AD, AR and XL forms, respectively as shown in Supplementary Table S3. For non-syndromic RP , 207 AD-RP families were genetically characterized with heterozygous variants identi - fied in one of 23 genes found. The most frequent mutated genes were RHO (65/207; 31.4%) and PRPF31 (MIM: 606419) (34/207; 16.4%). In AR-RP families, the most common gene mutated was USH2A (127/666; 19.1%). However, the number of other disease genes detected was very high (N = 70) in the 666 families characterized. For XL-RP families, both the number of cases and variety of genes were low (N = 9) as shown in Supplementary Table S4. For these patients, 41.2% (68/165) of the index cases (all males) carried a hemizygous pathogenic variant in RPGR (44 RPGR_ORF15 and 24 in the rest of RPGR regions) , and 32.7% (54/165) in CHM (MIM: 300390). A total of 53 cases out of the total 2100 (2.5%) were clinically reconsidered and reclassified after genetic testing: 12 NON-RP were reclassified as RP (9/754; 1.2%; characterized with RHO, FSCN2, PRPF8, AHI1, CNGB1, TRPM1 and CHM) or as syndromic IRD (3/754; 0.4%; COL11A1, CDH3 and MYO7A) and 37 RP as NON-RP Figure 1.

Moreover, 4 syndromic cases were reclassified to RP group (4/308; 1.3%; RDH12, PDE6A and RPGRIP1). Among syndromic IRD families, the causative gene was identified in 56 families with a diagnosis of USH1, 145 of USH2, 6 of atypical Usher, and 101 of other syndromes including Bardet-Biedl or Alstrom syndrome, respectively. In USH1, biallelic variants in MYO7A (MIM: 276903) were identified in 30 out of 56 patients (53.5%). USH2A defects were the main cause of USH2 in 90% (129/145) of the patients. The group others was a clinically heterogeneous group of non-Usher cases with a total of 48 involved genes, with BBS1 (MIM: 209901) being the most frequent one (N = 23), as shown in Supplementary Table S5. In addition to clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the group of others included in syndromic IRD also presented unusual modes of inheritance, such as triallelism. In our cohort, 4 possible triallelic cases have been Figure 4. Classification of mutated genes in the genetically solved RP affected cases.

The phenotypic modifier effect of the triallelism could only be stablished in two of the 4 families. One has two affected siblings with different phenotypic severity that correlates with the presence of the third allele; and in the other both affected showed triallelism and have the same clinical manifestation. Although, it could not be stablished in the rest of the families, as they were sporadic cases. Most frequent variants. Our findings reflect the high allelic heterogeneity in IRD. We identified 458 different disease-causing variants in 45 genes in cases a priori classified as NON-RP , as well as 836 in 94 genes in the a priori RP cases and 295 in 55 genes in the a priori syndromic IRD. The most common pathogenic variant detected in our NON-RP cohort was the previously known missense change ABCA4 c.3386G > T (p.Arg1129Leu) (180 mutated alleles of 3,618; 5% of the total pathogenic alleles), presented in 21.5% (162/754) of the character - ized families, in homozygous or compound heterozygous state in 18 and 144 families, respectively (Supplementary Table S6). Among the RP families, the most prevalent pathogenic variant was the missense change USH2A c.2276G > T (p.Cys759Phe), identified in 106 alleles in 8.4% of the solved families (87/1038); in 19 cases in homozygous and in 68 cases in compound heterozygous state. In addition, there were 15 other variants present in more than 10 genes (Supplementary Table S6). Some of the mutated genes overlap in NON-RP (Fig. 3), RP (Fig. 4) and syndromic IRD (Fig. 5). Disease-causing variant distribution in Spain. Analysis of causing variants by the different Spanish regions resulted in a wide variety of disease-causing variants. Table 1 shows variants detected in more than 5% of char - acterized families, by Spanish regions. All these variants are depicted in the Supplementary Table S6 of NON-RP and RP most frequent causing variants, except for the nonsense variant PRCD (OMIM: 610598) (GenBank: NM_001077620.3) c.64C > T (p.Arg22Ter), that was found in homozygosity in 3 families, representing 7.2% (6/83) of the identified alleles from Murcia. This is the first and largest comprehensive study addressing the prevalence and epidemiology of IRD in the Spanish population. The cohort here described, comprising 6089 cases from 4403 unrelated families, is not based on a national registry of IRD patients, but it is the outcome of a very wide recruiting effort of a single center over the last 28 years. An increasing number of centers are currently performing clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of IRD in Spain, therefore our cohort did not reflect all of IRD patients in our country. Hence, to date, no accurate data about the IRD prevalence in the Spanish population is available. In terms of representation of patients from the different Spanish regions, our cohort reflects a biased recruitment, being enriched with patients from Madrid and the surrounding regions (i.e. Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha, and Extremadura) probably due to the fact that our hospital has been their referral center during most of the time of the study. Other areas like Andalusia, Catalonia, Navarre or the Valencian Community had different referral centers and genetic testing is performed locally. In spite of these limitations, the large sample size of our cohort and the exhaustive molecular analysis performed over the years, together with an overall low genetic heterogeneity in the Spanish population13, have allowed a straightforward extrapolation of prevalent genes and/or variants in IRD. Considering a worldwide prevalence of 1:1000240001 and an estimated Spanish population of 46.7 million, our cohort would represent 2053% of the total patients with IRD in Spain. Despite numerous studies about the characteristics of the different IRDs in Spain, such as NON-RP and RP have been Table 1.

Several studies on IRD have been performed globally (Supplementary Table S7) and, in the two last years, some including big cohorts1416 or meta-analysis17 have been published, reporting more than 125 genes explaining 5562% of the families using several molecular techniques to achieve that1416 as it could be also seen in this study. Other studies focused on stablishing the prevalence of IRD in certain regions has been performed in Western countries and in cohorts of non-syndromic RP , including Western Australia (1:6000)18 or Maine (1:4756)19, as well as in cohorts with general IRD and an estimated prevalence of 1:3454 in Denmark20 or 1:3856 in Norway21. However, this prevalence has been reported in areas and populations with low rates of consanguinity and could be higher when consanguinity rate increases2, which is not the common scenario in Spain nowadays. Our study identified AR inheritance as the most common mode of inheritance for non-syndromic IRD, explaining up to 7075% NON-RP and RP subcohorts (Fig. 2A-I and A-II). By contrast, only 7% of our NONRP and RP families are explained by X-linked genes. These results were consistent with previous studies published1822. Besides, some cases could be explained by different molecular mechanisms as the pseudodomi - nance, incomplete penetrance or the presence of two variants in an AR gene in AD a priori families8, so extended segregation analysis within these families are needed. Additional non-Mendelian transmission patterns were only found in exceptionally rare cases with syndromic IRD, including 3 families carrying variants affecting the mitochondrial DNA and 4 cases with apparent triallelism in BBS-associated genes. Within syndromic IRD group, most of the cases were explained by AR biallelic monogenic inheritance. Similar to previous published studies from other countries3,23, Usher syndrome was the most prevalent form of syndromic IRD in our cohort, and more specifically, USH2, representing almost half of the total syndromic IRD families. The overall diagnostic rate of 53.2% obtained here is similar to other studies previously reported (5070%)2426. Molecular studies allowed the identification of the genes responsible for the disease and the reclassification of the inheritance type. In our work, 8.2% of the patients were reclassified after the detection of the disease-causing variants in genes with a specific inheritance pattern. All of those were or have been previously validated. Moreover, in all the characterized sporadic cases a more accurate genetic classification and counselling could be done8. Additionally, a 2.5% were clinically reclassified after the genetic testing, due to a poor clinical data acquisition at the origin center. So, identification of the genetic cause of the disease represents a hallmark for the patients, firstly, regarding genetic counselling and the risk of affectation for other relatives; and secondly, given the pos - sibility of future recruitments for clinical trials targeting specific genes and variants. A total of 142 different genes were identified as the cause of IRD in our study, but it is important to notice that each subgroup of the cohort (AD, AR and XL NON-RP and RP) has an enrichment of characterized cases in specific genes. For instance, PRPH2 was mutated in more than a third of AD-NON-RP families, followed by BEST1 (MIM: 607854). As expected, ABCA4 was the most prevalent gene in AR-NON-RP families. Recent studies in Norway21 and Korea22 also identified this gene as one of the most prevalent mutated genes. A study 27 in patients with MD and cone/cone-rod dystrophy showed a similar distribution of mutated genes, with ABCA4 , PRPH2 and BEST1 responsible for 74% of their solved cases. For the XL-NON-RP subcohort, RS1 was the most frequently mutated gene. Non-syndromic RP presented a wider spectrum of causative genes, with RHO , USH2A and RPGR ( RPGR_ ORF15 and the rest of RPGR regions) being the most prevalent ones in AD-RP , AR-RP and XL-RP subcohorts, respectively. Our findings are in line with those published in other studies8,28. For instance, 3, showed as well MYO7A , USH2A and BBS1 to be the most frequently mutated genes in USH1, USH2 and BBS, respectively. Other studies in different populations highlighted different genes as the most representative in their IRD cohorts. For example, 24 described RP1 (MIM: 603937) (11.3%) and EYS (MIM: 612424) (9.4%) as the most frequent genes in German patients with AR-RP , 22 detected that EYS (22%) and PDE6B (MIM: 180072) (17%) are most frequently involved in AR-RP in Korean patients. EYS was also the most prevalent causative gene in the Japanese population 29, implicated in 21 out of 33 AR-RP patients (63.6%), whereas in our population EYS was mutated in 5.5% of the families with a priori AR-RP diagnosis, being the fourth most frequent gene, after USH2A, CRB1 and ABCA4. However, the order of the causative genes in AR-RP changes after reviewing the clinical data of ABCA4 related IRD patients, since they were mostly reclassified as NON-RP , downgrading EYS as the third most common gene in AR-RP in our population. This result supports an eastward gradient in the frequency of EYS variants in patients throughout the world and within Europe, being more frequent in Germany than in Spain. The most frequent causing variants detected in our study appeared, as expected, in ABCA4 and USH2A, the most prevalent mutated genes in the Spanish population68,30. ABCA4 c.3386G > T (p.Arg1129Leu) is a variant almost exclusively found in Spanish NON-RP patients6,30, being probably a Spanish founder mutation31,32. How - ever, USH2A c.2276G > T (p.Cys759Phe) is not exclusive from the Spanish population and has been reported in other populations33. According to the geographical distribution of the variants within the country, no differences between regions were observed. In NON-RP , the two most common ABCA4 variants were also the most represented in regions with variant frequencies above 5%. Meanwhile, in RP we found a higher representation of the most common USH2A variant, which appeared above 5% of the total alleles in four regions. Finally, two variants appeared to be more frequent in some regions, i.e. PRCD c.64C > T (p.Arg22Ter) in Murcia and NR2E3 (MIM: 604485) (GenBank: NM_014249.4) c.932G > A (p.Arg311Gln) in the Canary Islands, where a founder effect could be happening. Our results delineate the genetic background of the Spanish IRD patients, indicating a wide range of causa - tive genes involved in the disease. Some of the causing variants identified are also frequent in Europe. Some examples include the ABCA4 c.5882G > A (p.Gly1961Glu), reported with high prevalence in the Italian, German 8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports |  11:1526 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81093-y www.nature.com/scientificreports/and Spanish populations30,34,35; the c.2276G > T (p.Cys759Phe) as one of the most frequent variants in USH2A, especially in European countries36, USH2A c.2299delG (p.Glu767SerfsTer21), which is possibly an ancestral European pathogenic variant37; BBS1 (GenBank: NM_024649.5) c.1169T > G (p.Met390Arg), identified 38 in 22 North American BBS probands with North European ancestry; and CRB1 (GenBank: NM_201253.3) c.2843G > A (p.Cys948Tyr), identified repeatedly in different European countries39,40. Finally, RHO (GenBank: NM_000539.3) c.1040C > T (p.Pro347Leu), described in the Italian and French populations41,42 and also in non-European cohorts5,43,44. Variants found in individuals from East Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern countries also appeared in our Spanish cohort: PRCD c.64C > T (p.Arg22Ter) 14 in homozygosis in 15 Israeli Muslim Arab families, 45 in a Persian family; and FAM161A (MIM: 613596) (GenBank: NM_001201543.2) c.1355_1356delCA (p.Thr452SerfsTer3), which was identified in Jewish families mainly originating from North African countries46. As mentioned above, the variant in PRCD was found with a higher frequency in the region of Murcia, and this could be due to the settlement of Muslim populations during several centuries during the Middle Ages13. FAM161A does not have a significant specific geographical distribution in Spain. Remarkably, we identified three pathogenic variants with high frequency in Spain: ABCA4 c.3386G > T (p.Arg1129Leu), previously mentioned; CERKL (MIM: 608381) (GenBank: NM_201548.5) c.847C > T (p.Leu283Phe), first 47, and RP1 c.1625C > G (p.Ser542Ter) previously described origi - nally as a Spanish founder pathogenic variant. These three variants had been scarcely reported outside the Spanish population. In the case of RP1 c.1625C > G (p.Ser542Ter) variant48, because of its presence in 11 out of 244 unrelated families, we can extrapolate that it may very well account for approximately 4.5% of all AR-RP cases in the Spanish population. Other groups also identified this variant in Swiss patients26. In conclusion, this study shows the general landscape of the genetic underpinnings of IRD in Spain and will help design clinical and preventive healthcare approaches to this disorder in our country. Cohort description. A retrospective analysis was performed including all IRD patients from our Spanish registry at the Fundacion Jimenez Diaz University Hospital (FJD, Madrid, Spain) from  until August . This patient registry includes: all patients referred to the Genetic Service at the FJD for genetic diagnostic testing and/or counselling due to a previous clinical suspicion of IRD, and patients without genetic analysis in our unit but identified in the shared electronic clinical history of our same-company hospitals using ICD (International Classification of Diseases) terms. The complete cohort contains 6089 IRD affected cases (including index cases and affected relatives) belonging to 4403 unrelated families as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the FJD under approval number 134/2016_FJD and fulfilled all the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and its further reviews. A written informed consent form was obtained from all the patients or their legal guardians. IRD classification and diagnostic criteria. During this study, different clinical, demographic and familiar data were collected, including (i) family pedigree; (ii) age at onset of visual acuity loss, extent of visual field loss, night blindness and/or other early symptoms of retinal dystrophy; (iii) presence of any systemic findings suggestive of syndromic forms of IRD; (iv) geographical origin of the patients. Clinical diagnosis was based on ophthalmic examination, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity, visual field testing, fundus examination and, if possible, full-field electroretinography, fundus autofluorescence and spectral domain optical coherence tomography scan. NON-RP and RP include non-syndromic IRD, and their clinical classification was done according to previously described criteria6,8. NON-RP group include most patients with CD, CRD and achromatopsia, although some of them were included in the RP group due to incomplete phenotyping at the moment of the diagnosis. Non-syndromic LCA cases were also included in RP . For NON-RP and RP families, an a priori inheritance pattern (AD/AR/XL/sporadic (S)) was established according to previously described criteria1. The subgroup of XL-RP also included choroideremia cases. For cases not extensively described in the first referral, a generic classification was made as NON-RP or RP . Criteria for syndromic IRD diagnosis were previously described7,9. Information about the geographic origin of all the IRD cases from Spain was available in 4668. They are distributed throughout the 17 different Spanish communities (Fig. 1A). Inheritance reclassification of IRD cases. After molecular diagnosis, inherited patterns were reviewed and compared with a priori data of each family. Statistical analysis between these data sets to assess the global association in the NON-RP group was made using the Fishers exact test with a p equal to 0.497. Whereas for the RP group, Chi-square test was used with a p below 0.001. Comparisons for each type of inheritance have also been made with the Fishers exact test in the NON-RP Unclassified subgroup and with the Chi-square test in the rest. Fishers exact test was used in those cases in which more than 20% of expected values were below than 5, or at least one of the expected frequencies was below 1. Regarding the significance levels chosen, we have a global comparison for which the significance level is the usual threshold of 0.05 and p-value is not corrected, and several post-hoc comparisons for which Bonferronis multiple comparisons adjustment is applied, multiplying the p-values by the number of comparisons. Prevalence of IRD. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the largest cohort of patients with IRD from Spain, whom were recruited during a period of 28 years by a single center, the FJD. The FJD is a center of reference for molecular diagnosis of IRD from all over the country, especially in some specific autonomous 9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports |  11:1526 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81093-y www.nature.com/scientificreports/communities, like Castile and Leon, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura or Madrid. On the other hand, as we take into account other Spanish regions, there are other centers of reference and the prevalence data obtained is inconclusive. Prevalence was calculated for each clinical type of the disease by dividing the total number of diagnosed IRD cases by the total population in Spain, published by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE; http:// www. ine. es) in January . Genomic screening. Genomic DNA samples were obtained from the FJD Biobank from a total of 3951 families (89.7%), including 1291 NON-RP ,  non-syndromic RP and 577 syndromic IRD families. Molecular studies were performed using different molecular techniques as shown in Supplementary Table S8. According to the technology available and the knowledge on the genetic determinants of IRD at the time of the diagnosis, a maximum of 291 different genes involved in IRD were processed for the molecular characterization (Supplementary S1 Appendix). In these studies, index cases were initially screened, analysed following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG; https:// www. acmg. net/ docs/ stand ards_ guide lines_ for_ the_ inter preta tion_ of_ seque nce_ varia nts. pdf ) variants classification guidelines. If potentially disease-causing variants were found, segregation analysis was performed when DNA samples from relatives were available. In the general description of mutated genes and frequent pathogenic variants, only fully molecularly char - acterized index cases were considered. Patients with a heterozygote allele in a recessive gene were counted as uncharacterized. The frequency of recurrent IRD causing variants was established considering not only the total Spanish population, but also the different geographical regions of Spain (Fig. 1A), in order to assess the possibility of identifying any endemic or founder effects. Pathogenic variants with a prevalence above 5% in a particular region were recorded, and only those with a higher prevalence were considered for further analysis. Part of the NGS data are available in public, open access repositories such as the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA; https:// www. ebi. ac. uk/ ega/ home; EGAD00001005746 and EGAD00001005498), RD-Connect (https:// rd- conne ct. eu/) and the Collaborative Spanish Variant Server (CSVS; http:// csvs. babel omics. org/) as aggregated data.

Open AccessBMC Ophthalmology Cheng Li, Chunxia Peng, Chengyue Zhang and Ningdong Li* Purpose To compare the retinal thicknesses (RT) and choroidal thicknesses (CT) in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) children y children using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) optical coherence tomography (OCT). The RT and CT in different genetic subgroups of autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) and X-linked inheritance RP (XLRP) were further studied to investigate the characteristics of retinal and choroidal changes in the early stages of RP . ospective analysis was performed on a group of patients with RP who underwent EDI-OCT. Thirty-two children (64 eyes) with RP and 28 age- and refraction-matched healthy children (56 eyes) were included in the study. Seven of the 32 RP children (14 eyes) had X-linked inheritance RP , and 10 (20 eyes) had autosomal dominant inheritance RP . RT and CT were measured by optical coherence tomography and compared between the 32 children with RP and 28 controls and between 7 XLRP and 10 ADRP children. , there were 18 males and 14 females with an average age of 6.6  2.4 y ears. The mean RT was smaller in the RP group than in the control group at all of the locations. The mean temporal CT was smaller in the RP group (243.76  60.82 m) than in the control g roup (275.23  40.92 m) (P = 0.001), while there was nificant thinning on the foveal or nasal side. The best-corrected visual acuity of the XLRP group (0.40  0.19) was worse than that of the ADRP g roup (0.68  0.21) ( P = 0.001), but the disease duration was the same (P = 0.685). T (173.85  22.87 m) than in the ADRP gr oup (192.20  9.70 m) (P = 0.003), while there was no sig the other locations we studied. The mean temporal CT was smaller in the XLRP group (211.21  69.41 m) than in the oup (274.45  57.91 m) (P = 0.007); CT measur ements in XLRP children showed a more severe reduction on the temporal side. oid in RP children was preferentially smaller on the temporal side of the macula, and retinal thinning was relatively extensive. Children with RP have strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The XLRP children demonstrated greater RT reduction at the fovea and greater CT reduction at the temporal side of the macula than the ADRP children. Our findings also provide evidence that the changes in thicknesses may be indicative of the greater severity of XLRP versus ADRP in the early stage. mentosa, Retinal and choroidal thicknesses, XLRP and ADRP Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inheritable retinal disor - der with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4000 ~ 5000 in t he global population [1 ]. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), X-linked (XL), or digenic pattern [2 ]. Night blindness usually presents as an *Correspondence:  , Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childr ens Health, No.56 Nanlishi Road, Xicheng District, Beijing 100045, ChinaPage 2 of 9  BMC Ophthalmology  23:25 early symptom of RP , followed by a progressive contraction of the peripheral visual field. The patients central vision may be preserved in the early stage but will decrease over time, ultimately resulting in complete blindness when cone cell function is lost entirely. Fundus changes are typically char - acterized as a waxy pallor of the optic disc with narrowing tinal blood vessels and formation of bone spiculelike pigment deposits at the mid-periphery of the retina. The electrophysiological response of the patients retina in an electroretinogram (ERG) may be diminished or absent. RP has strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity, with diverse inheritance patterns, disease-causing genes and clinical features. The expressivity of the causative genes is variable among patients with different inheritance patterns and different gene mutations. In the early stage of RP , visual impairment is believed to be milder in AD patients, who have a relatively late onset of illness and retain their central vision into adulthood, than in XL patients, who have a more severe disease course, especially for affected males [3 ]. Although RP is caused by mutations in many genes, the final pathway of pathological change is apoptosis of the photoreceptor cells (PRC) and the retinal pigment epithe - lium (RPE). The PRC and RPE atrophy due to loss of cells he disease progresses; this degradation ultimately leads to structural changes in the whole retina. The choroid lies adjacent to the retina and supplies it with abundant oxygen, blood and nutrients to meet the high metabolic demands of the PRC and RPE. When the retina undergoes structural changes, the choroid, which is entirely com - posed of vascular tissue, may be involved in retinal ves - sel narrowing. In this study, we evaluated the anatomical s in the retina and choroid in patients with autoso - mal dominant RP (ADRP) and X-linked RP (XLRP). We conducted a retrospective study including thirty-two chil - dren (64 eyes) with RP and 28 age- and refraction-matched healt hy children (56 eyes). Patients with XLRP and ADRP of age were recruited for this study. The diagnosis of RP was based on the following criteria: (1) reduction or extinction of electrophysiological responses recorded in an ERG; and (2) typical fundus changes on reti - noscopic examination. Children in the healthy control group seases except for some refractive errors. Patients were divided into the XLRP and ADRP groups according to their disease-causing genes. The duration of symptoms and onset age of XLRP and ADRP were matched (shown in Table 1). All participants underwent ophthalmologic exami - nations, including evaluations of best-corrected visual acuity llen charts, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of each eye, and examination of the vitreous and fundus by ophthalmoscopy and photography [4 ]. Refractive error was examined using a Welch Allyn VS100 apparatus.

The thick - nesses of the retina and choroid were measured manu - ally using the calliper function in the Heidelberg reader tware . The retinal thickness (RT) was measured border of the RPE, and thickness measurements were obtained at the fovea and at 1000 m and 3000 m nasal section . The choroid thickness (CT) was measured from the outer border of the RPE vertically to the inner scleral border at the fovea and at 1000 m and 3000 m and temporal to the centre of the fovea in a hori - zontal section (shown in Fig. 1) [ 8]. Both the RT and CT were measured by the same experienced physician; the measurements were repeated three times and averaged. Molecular diagnosis Three millilitres of peripheral venous blood was col - lected from the patients and their matched control par - ticipants. The patients DNA was extracted from the phocytes according to a standard protocol (Roche Biochemical, Inc.). Exome sequencing was performed by the commercial Myogenomic Company (Beijing, China). Sequences were analysed using the Seqman program in DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc., Mad - ison, WI).

Statistical analysis was per - formed using a statistical software package (SPSS, ver - sion 23.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Frequency and criptive statistics were used for data analysis. Demo - graphic and clinical characteristics, including age, CT , were compared using independent sample t tests. All the data were normally distributed, and sex was compared using the chi-squared test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Sixty-four eyes of 32 children with RP (18 males and 14 females) and 56 eyes of 28 healthy controls (15 males and 13 females) were included in the study. A flowchart of patient recruitment is shown in Fig. 2. There was no significant difference in age, sex, or spherical equivalent between the RP and control groups (shown in Table 1). Fourteen eyes of 7 children with X-linked inheritance (5 males and 2 females) and 20 eyes of 10 children with autosomal dominant inheritance (6 males and 4 females) were included in the study and allocated to the XLRP and ADRP groups, respectively (Table 1). There were significant differences in the RT between the RP group and the control group (p = 0.000) at all he measured points (Table 2). In the RP group, the 243.76  60.82 m, while the c orresponding measure - ment in the control group was 275.23  40.92 m; this difference was significant (p < 0.05; show n in Table 3). There was no significant thinning in the other locations we studied. We found that the CT measurements of RP children showed a more severe reduction on the tempo - ral side. Macular thicknesses and sub-macular CT of the roup and the control group were presented in Fig.3. The mean RT of the XLRP and ADRP group are pre - sented in Table 2. Ther e were significant differences in the foveal RT between the two groups (p = 0.003). foveal RT of XLRP patients was less than that of ADRP patients (Fig.3), but there was no significant differ - ence at 1000 m or 3000 m fr om the fovea. We found that retinal degeneration at the macula was more obvi - ous in children with XLRP than in children with ADRP . BCVA in XLRP and ADRP respectively (Fig.4). The vis - ual acuity of the XLRP group was worse than that of the P group (Table 2), which also indicates that XLRP leads to seriously damage. The mean CT of the XLRP and ADRP group are pre - sented in Table 3. The C T of t he XLRP group 3000 m to the temporal side of the fovea was smaller than that of the ADRP group, while there was no significant thinning in the other locations we studied (p = 0.007). We f severe reduction on the temporal side than those of ADRP children. The temporal thinning of the choroid was more pronounced in children with RP and XLRP than in the con - trol and ADRP groups, respectively. There were positive relations between macular thicknesses and sub-choroi - dal thicknesses in RP group (Fig.5 ). Some c linical data from 2 patients with XLRP and ADRP are shown in Fig. 6 .

There are diurnal variations in the retina and choroid measurements, so we carried out our OCT examinations in the afternoon [9 ]. The decrease in the RT with the progression of RP is due to progressive degeneration of the rod and cone cells; the typical early changes in RP are represented by short - ening of the outer segments of photoreceptors, with al degeneration of the cones .

Thus, the RT val - ues obtained in our study indicated that the severity of than in the ADRP group. The reduction in the thickness in the macular area is more serious in children with an XLRP genotype than in those with an ADRP genotype. Our findings also provided evidence that the changes in thicknesses may be representative of the greater sever - ity of XLRP versus ADRP in the early stage. Thinning on t obvious in RP than in healthy children and in XLRP than in ADRP children. This choroidal thickening is different from that in children with simple myopia, for whom it begins in central foveal regions . The choroid pro - vides nutrition to outer retinal structures and plays a ant role in the pathophysiology of RP . The CT is significantly lower in RP patients than in normal controls [15, 16]. As the sub-choroidal thicknesses thin - ning, the macular thicknesses become smaller in RP .

The loss of photore - ceptors results in decreased oxygen demand and a conse - quent reduction in the blood supply. The quantification T could reflect changes in ocular vascular perfusion . Our results suggest that the temporal flow is more likely to be affected. Therefore, retinal degeneration may stimulate choroidal atrophy, and conversely, choroidal changes may worsen the degeneration of the outer ret - ina. This may also explain why XLRP patients develop mptoms earlier and have more severe impairment than ADRP patients.

The severe forms of RP are within ategory of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Patients are characterized by a severe phenotype even in the early stages of disease development , with earlier onset of night blindness, more rapid constriction of visual fields and, eventually, more severe loss of central acuity than in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa . Most affected males exhibit early-onset symptoms, with night blindness in the first decade, a reduction in the visual field in the second decade, and rapid progression towards blindness (worse than approximately 20/200) by 40 years of age . The majority of mutations that cause XLRP lead to abnormal protein distribution in the cell . As the disease progresses, it affects the function of tubulin and ciliary structures and causes increasing damage to structures and function . A number of retinal proteins are required for cilia-dependent outer segment transport, generation or maintenance . The abnormality of the connecting cilia could result in decreased protein trans - port from the inner to the outer photoreceptor . pes of XLRP are common in the clinic: RPGR and RP2. RPGR is characterized by conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factors. The protein localizes to the outer segment of photoreceptors. RPGR defects can occur at multiple steps in material transport towards the distal outer segment . Due to the importance of these path - ways in photoreceptor development and survival, mutations GR might disrupt the interactions and lead to retinal degeneration. Mutations in RP2 cause the second most fre - quent form of XLRP . The gene products show homology h human cofactor C, which acts as a GTPase-activating protein in the final step of beta-tubulin folding. RP2 also interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3), which acts as a microtubule-associated small GTP-binding pro - tein that localizes to the sensory cilia of photoreceptors . ations in RP2 lead to the accumulation of incorrectly folded photoreceptor- or neuron-specific tubulin isoforms, resulting in the progressive degeneration of the retina. ADRP is a relatively mild form of RP . The gene muta - tions associated with ADRP can result in altered pro - tein activity, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction due to olded mutant protein molecules, mistrafficking and mislocalization of the mutant protein, and even adverse effects on the proper functioning of the wild-type pro - tein, thus affecting the homeostasis of cells and ultimately resulting in their death . ADRP includes 30 es, such as RHO mutations. RHO mutations are associated with two phenomena: interference with the function of normal rhodopsin and intrinsic toxicity of the mutant protein. Most of the mutations lead to opsin mis - folding and instability, leading to a relatively mild disease e .In conclusion, the choroid in RP children becomes thinner preferentially on the temporal side of the macula, and thinning of the retina is relatively extensive. Children with RP have strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The XLRP children demonstrated greater RT reduction at the fovea and greater CT reduction at the temporal side of the macula than the ADRP children. Our findings also provided evidence that the changes in thicknesses may be indicative of the greater severity of XLRP versus ADRP in the early stage. This study has some limitations. The retinal and cho - roidal thicknesses were measured manually, which may eate a potential bias. The study sample size was small, and larger studies should be conducted. Axial length can interfere with accurate retinal and choroidal thick - ness measurements, and our future research should be omprehensive. As this was a retrospective study, the data are prone to bias. Additionally, further studies should investigate whether the refractive state of children with XLRP and children with ADRP affects retinal thick - ness. We should also perform more refined genetic data es, which may reveal other factors contributing to the diagnosis and prognosis of RP . Further studies might enhance our clinical evaluation of such patients. We thank Doctor Man Hu for the data collection.

Optic Neuropathies Optic neuropathies are among the most common causes of blindness in the working age population [ 1], with inherited forms (including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) [ 2] and Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA)) affecting about 1 in 10,000 of the population [ 35]. In this review, we will present a brief introduction to these conditions and how the availability of powerful emerging techniques, including transcriptomics, are quickly revolutionizing both diagnosis and development of novel therapies with potential applications beyond the eye. Vision is ultimately lost in both LHON and DOA as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 6]. This specific susceptibility of RGCs to such dysfunction is not completely understood. However, the relatively large metabolic demand for these specialized cells and their unique anatomy are thought to be important contributory factors. RGCs have long axonal segments which lack myelin throughout their intraocular course but gain a myelin sheath on exiting the eye beyond the lamina cribosa [ 7,8]. As the only nervous tissue visible in vivo and with increasingly sophisticated cell culture techniques [ 9,10], RGCs present a powerful system in which to interrogate mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathways that ultimately lead to cell loss and disease Genes  ,12, 147. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12020147 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genesGenes  ,12, 147 2 of 15 development. Such dysfunction has been implicated in major neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsons disease [ 11], Alzheimers disease [ 12], and other forms of dementia , but the polygenetic inheritance and environmental contribution to these common conditions are particularly challenging when investigating their pathogenesis. As monogenetic conditions where mitochondrial function is disturbed, both LHON and DOA can mitigate some of these challenges and act as useful model diseases of more complex neurodegenerative disease processes. LHON is a primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorder, with the majority of cases caused by one of three point mutationsnamely, m.3460G>A in the MT-ND1 gene, m.11778G>A in the MT-ND4 gene, and m.14484T>C in theMT-ND6 geneall of which encode for essential subunits of mitochondrial complex I [3,7,1416]. LHON is additionally interesting due to its predilection to manifest in males and its marked incomplete penetranceboth of which could perhaps have origins in transcriptomic differences. In comparison, DOA is nuclear-encoded mitochondrial optic neuropathy caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene (3q28-q29), which encodes for a multimeric dynamin GTPase protein located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. OPA1 subserves a number of functions, including the regulation of mitochondrial fusion, the stability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial biogenesis, the sequestration of pro-apoptotic cytochrome cwithin the mitochondrial cristae, and mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy) [4,1720]. 1.2. -Omics Technologies as Applied to Inherited Optic Neuropathies Our understanding of mitochondrial biology and disease has advanced greatly over recent years, not least due to the development and maturation of -omics technologies. These can be defined as high-throughput technologies capable of detecting differences in a multitude of molecular constituents in organisms [ 21], with those that represent the three strata of central biological dogma (gen omics , transcript omics , and prote omics ) being prominent. These fields deal with the detection of differences in DNA sequences, gene transcription, and proteins within tissue. Additionally, particularly relevant to mitochondrial disease is the developing field of metabol omics (centered on the comparison of levels of products of metabolism) [22,23] and lipid omics . Whilst these disciplines are linked by their comparative natureexperimental plans often involve the contrast of different conditions (e.g., control and diseased states, or between different cell types)the emerging field of multi-omics (or vertical - omics ) focuses on complimentary comparisons across domains (Figure 1). For example, highlighting changes replicated across the transcriptome, the proteome and metabolome will carry particular significance [ 24,25], and this approach is already being used in mitochondrial research [ 26]. As these technologies and their complementary bioinformatic analysis techniques develop, the power of - omics  investigations is likely to increase. 1.3. Transcriptomics Specifically, the transcriptome refers to the RNA transcribed within a cell, or group of cells, often with a particular focus on mRNA (both coding and non-coding). Several methods to quantify mRNA have been developed (see below) and are applied to genetic eye diseases. For example, assessing transcribed features in a particular sample can be used to compare changes in gene expression either over time or between control and diseased states (such as optic neuropathies) [ 27]. Features showing differential expression may be implicated in the disease process, highlighting areas for further investigation to uncover aetiologic pathways, novel biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. Genes  ,12, 147 3 of 15 Figure 1. A schematic representing the processes of modeling and investigating inherited optic neuropathies using -omics methods. ( A) Model diseases such as DOA and LHON can be powerful tools in which to investigate the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. The study of patients with inherited optic neuropathies is often a two-way process: in one direction, the characterization of their phenotype and genotype allows the development of useful disease models (for example, cell -and animal-based). These provide an efficient environment in which to increase our understanding of underlying disease processes as well as a testing ground for novel therapies before their return in the opposite direction, back into patients. ( B) Tissues from model systems can be investigated using used in multiple -omics techniquesin some cases, these can be performed simultaneously and analyzed in vertical multi-omics experiments (see text). ATACseq Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatina method for assessing which areas of the chromatin superstructure are open and so likely available for active in transcription, is an example of the rapidly expanding field of epigenomics . (C) Multiple transcriptomic techniques are available and have particular strength in different experimental situations. Novel: Novel techniques are emerging that will further the resolution of these techniquesm including those with abilities to sequence longer transcripts in one read and those that integrate temporal and spatial information regarding transcripts (see text). RNA-seqRNA-sequencing; scRNA-seqsingle-cell RNAseq; snRNAseqsingle nucleus RNAseq. (D) Transcriptomic techniques gain power from the large quantity of data that they produce. This necessitates adequately designed bioinformatic pipelines that are tailored to the exact scientific question being asked in order to produce a list of candidate genes for further investigation back in model systems. ( E) Model systems of diseases can include those based on cultured patient cells or be animals carrying pathogenic variants, leading to phenocopies of human disease. Samples from these models used in transcriptomic analysis can include tissue (such as retinas) or cell cultures. As many transcriptomic experiments compare expression between conditions (e.g., disease and control) to produce lists of differentially expressed genes, the further technical and functional validation of these can be performed back in model systems in preparation for therapeutic translation in patients (see text).Genes  ,12, 147 4 of 15 2. Transcriptomics in Inherited Optic Neuropathies 2.1. Applications of Transcriptomics in Optic Neuropathies Several factors make transcriptomics a particularly suitable methodology for the investigation of optic neuropathies. Whilst the anatomy and physiology of the retina and optic nerve are relatively well understood compared with other areas of the central nervous system [ 28], our understanding of pathophysiology in these structures can be less comprehensive. This is particularly true for inherited optic neuropathies such as LHON and DOA, where the genomic determinant of the disease in many patients is readily identifiable as a single gene (monogenic disorder) [ 14,18,19]. However, less is known regarding how this translates into the clinical phenotype of RGC death as well as other as yet unexplained facets of these model diseases (such as the incomplete penetrance in LHON when the pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation is present in the homoplastic state in both affected patients and carriers). Thus, this presents an unmet need to identify the novel pathways and genes involved to which comparative transcriptomics is particularly suited. Whilst direct access to RGCs and patient tissues is limited, cellular and mouse model systems [ 7,29,30] have developed in recent years into powerful platforms with which to perform transcriptomic studies (and, more importantly, validate and investigate their findings). For example, in vivo neuro-retinal tissue can easily be visualized (if not directly sampled) at the cellular level with techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), and there are well defined metrics of RGC function at the behavioral (acuity) [ 31], reflex (pupillary) [ 32], and electrophysiological levels [ 33]. To compliment this, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) RGC models derived from LHON and DOA patient tissues have proved invaluable for molecular investigations  2.2. Disadvantages of Transcriptomics in Optic Neuropathies Despite the suitability of inherited optic neuropathy investigations, the limitations of transcriptomics must be borne in mind when considering data from such studies. In isolation, transcriptomics gives us no direct information on protein dynamics. The mRNA expression level of a particular gene may correspond to increased protein levels, increased protein turnover, or indeed changes to post translational protein modifications. Therefore, the validation of transcriptomic findings at the protein or functional level is required if conclusions are to be drawn regarding the downstream effects of mRNA changes. Planning this can present further challengesfor example, when comparing transcriptomes in conditions (such as optic neuropathies) with changes dramatic enough to lead to cell death, large numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are likely. Therefore, methods to prioritize which DEG to validate while minimizing bias have been developed, and these are discussed further below and reviewed elsewhere . Whilst preparing tissue for transcriptomic studies, careful tissue handling is equally important in reducing bias, and indices of extracted RNA quality (such as RNA Integrity Number RIN [ 35]) can be used to assess this. Additionally, and especially in a highly cellular, complex tissue such as the retina, it is essential to ensure that the identity of cells undergoing processing is known (for example, photoreceptors and bipolar cells have an interdigitated synapse that can make them difficult to dissociate and isolate [ 36]. Additionally, the cells isolated must be viable. It is well established that the dissection of retina from mouse models requires the cutting of the optic nerve (and therefore the transection of RGC axons), so processing should be as expedient as possible to minimize the stress response recorded. Indeed, many of these limitations have been addressed as isolation methods have been developed. Genes  ,12, 147 5 of 15 3. Transcriptomic Methodologies 3.1. Tissue Selection and Sample Preparation One methodological aspect that has been particularly refined is that of tissue selection and preparation. Earlier studies made use of tissues dissected by hand from animal models [ 37] and dissociated into suspension or collected from cultured cells [ 38] in bulk. This has the advantage of providing a large quantity of RNA for further processing. In addition, the processing of tissue in this way is relatively easy and expedient, reducing postmortem alterations in expressionparticularly relevant to RGCs following the truncation of their axon during enucleation. Indeed, while improvements have been made to tissue preparation processes (see below), the basic processes remain constant: RNA is extracted, isolated, and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) representing alibrary of the transcripts present [ 27]. Libraries are sequenced after undergoing amplification [ 39] or enrichment steps for a particular form of RNAfor example, selecting for the poly-adenosine tail of transcribed mRNA (of either nuclear or mitochondrial origin) [ 40] or depleting ribosomal RNA before reverse transcription [ 41] in order to focus on protein coding mRNA. 3.2. Quantifying Expression 3.2.1. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Once the library has been prepared, it is necessary to quantify the expression of transcripts. In the most basic form, qRT-PCR is an accurate technique to interrogate a small number of genes [ 42,43]; however, it is limited by its need for oligo-primers requiring the a priori selection of candidate genes. This technique remains in use as a confirmatory tool (for example, to confirm sample purity) due to its ease, ubiquity, and economy. However, the inherent amplification of error in the technique [ 44,45] and the concurrent improvement in the technical reliability of microarray and RNA-seq techniques has seen it widely replaced by other assays in validation experiments. 3.2.2. RNA-Seq Whilst the development of microarray assays [ 46] represented a paradigm shift and the beginning of high-throughput transcriptomics, their requirement to define which genes to investigate a priori , as well as technical limitations [ 47,48], have led to their replacement in most applications by RNA-seq techniques. RNA-seq refers to techniques where cDNA is directly sequenced using high-throughput sequencing techniques [ 27]. The superior flexibility and unbiased nature of this approach (not requiring the a priori definition of probes) has seen it supersede microarrays in many areasparticularly comparative transcriptomics. Indeed, due to these advantages RNAseq has become an integral technique in clinical and laboratory science and is the the gold standard in multiple disciplines, most notably in oncology  but also more generally (reviewed elegantly here ). Several modifications of this technique are particularly relevant to the study of RGCs and optic neuropathies. Given the diversity of RGC cell types [ 5153] and their differential response to disease [ 54], techniques that are able to prepare libraries from and sequence the transcriptomes of individual cells (single cell "scRNA-seq [ 55,56] or single-nuclei snRNA-seq [ 57]), are particularly useful. These techniques overcome difficulties with  bulk RNAseq techniques in resolving changes in gene expression between subpopulations of cells. This is achieved by labelling individual transcripts as being from a particularly labelled cell: this vastly increases resolution by allowing analysis at the level of individual cells, but concurrently increases the complexity of analysis and the resources required. In such methods, single cells are isolated (for example, using a microwell plate or in individual droplets using microfluidics) and combined with reaction substrate and a barcoded bead (see [ 58] for a review of individual methods). This allows library preparation and sequencing on a cell by cell basis, potentially uncovering changes masked by techniques dealing with bulk batches of cells [ 59]. Single-cell sequencing has also been useful when used with clustering techniques to group similar single-cell transcriptomes from individualGenes  ,12, 147 6 of 15 RGCs in the search for novel molecular markers correlating with anatomical and functional characteristics for subpopulations of RGCs . 3.2.3. Future Directions in Quantifying Expression This characterization of RGC subpopulations and their role in optic neuropathies is likely to particularly benefit from rapidly developing new technologies within RNA-seq. Improvements in the resolution of the single-cell long read sequencing [ 60] (as opposed to short reads focusing on the 30end of transcripts) and RNA timestamping [ 61] (which details temporal changes in mRNA transcripts) have enhanced our ability to understand how differing transcripts interact and turn over. At the tissue level, the emergence of technology to allow single-cell multiomics simultaneously on the same cells [ 62] will further increase the resolution of our understanding of these cells in optic neuropathies. Perhaps most excitingly, however, is the emerging technique of spatial transcriptomics [ 63], in which the molecular labelling of individually sequenced cells can preserve information regarding their anatomical location. If this can be developed in conjunction with multiple electrode array neurophysiology [ 64], which similarly preserves retinal topology, there is potential for a technique to obtain both single-cell transcriptomic and single-cell functional data from the same cells, allowing direct validation. 3.3. Analysis of RNA-Seq Data As RNA-seq techniques have developed over the past few years, so too have the bioinformatic approaches required to make sense of the often vast quantities of data produced. Indeed, there is no gold-standard pipeline or set of processes for either bulk [ 65] or scRNA-seq [ 66] analysis, and the approaches have to be tailored to the individual experiment and the scientific question being addressed by a particular study. However, general stages of processing do tend to be applied, even if their details vary (Figure 1, and reviewed here [ 27,55,6769]). This variability and the great pace of advancement in bioinformatic methodologies make it essential to precisely document software versions and the settings, as these can greatly alter results [ 55]. Indeed, replicating notable results using different software packages may add to the power of conclusions. 4. Clinical and Research Applications of Transcriptomics 4.1. Diagnostic Mirroring this rapid advancement in data analysis and software techniques in RNAseq has been a concurrent improvement in our diagnostic capabilities in genetic disease. In recent years, approaches to attaining molecular diagnoses in optic neuropathies and in genetic disease more generally have changed with the continually improving technologies. The traditional approach of testing for a particular pathogenic variant in a single gene based on a characteristic clinical presentation has been extended with the testing of panels of genes associated with a particular phenotype (optic atrophy, for example). This has the advantage of combining clinical prior probability to provide a high diagnostic confidence when positive, but limits diagnoses to those pre-determined variants tested for on the panels. While whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have increased diagnostic yields up to as much as 50% of cases [ 70] by allowing the identification of novel variants, one of their disadvantages is not providing direct information on the pathogenicity of variants . In this situation, sequencing transcribed RNA (RNA-seq) can be hugely useful in indicating the downstream effects of variantsfor example, by detecting expression levels outside the normal physiological range (up or down), splicing-related errors, posttranscriptional modifications, or mono-allelic expression [ 72]. This is especially useful where little is known regarding a gene, its role in the target tissue, or variants in non-coding regions. In combination with WGS, RNA-seq has been used to characterize novel disease-causing genes in mitochondrial disease .Genes  ,12, 147 7 of 15 One potential drawback to diagnostic RNA-seq in optic neuropathies lies in its need to be performed on biopsied disease tissues where the target genes are expressed, which is not feasible for the optic nerve. A muscle biopsy has proven to be a useful surrogate in mitochondrial disease, given its high energy demand [ 74]. However, it is emerging that many genes can be investigated using less invasive techniques, such as blood sampling [ 74]. With the licensing of gene replacement therapies, the need for molecular diagnosis is more important than ever for individual patients in order to select the most appropriate gene therapy as these options emerge. To this end, RNA-seq is an important addition to our armamentarium by expanding our diagnostic ability. 4.2. Disease Mechanisms 4.2.1. Exploring Disease Mechanisms Using Transcriptomics As discussed above, transcriptomics is invaluable to the identification of differentially expressed genes between samples, in particular the comparison of healthy and diseased tissues. This has great potential for inherited optic neuropathies (see Table 1) where the mechanisms connecting pathogenic genomic variants and eventual RGC death are poorly understood. Genes expressed at significantly higher or lower levels in diseased tissues compared to healthy tissues are obvious candidate players involved in the underlying disease process [ 37]. However, with the scale of transcriptomic data, this list can extend to many hundreds of genes, and processes are required to prioritize the most biologically plausible candidates for further investigation. A fruitful approach to this has been to interrogate lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for connected sets of genes. With the development of microarray and RNA-seq technology [ 75], increasingly sophisticated methods, both those relying on the intrinsic properties of DEG data sets (unbiased) and those drawing from databases of gene and protein function and interactions [ 7679] (introducing biological insight) have been developed. These include overrepresentation analysis, where lists of DEGs are compared to annotated databases (such as Gene Ontology [ 80] categories) to highlight ontologies that are seen particularly often in the list [ 76]. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [ 81] provides another strategy where lists of DEG are interrogated for the overrepresentation of groups of genes that are connected to particular biological functions. Ultimately, however, the decision on which DEGs to further investigate in order to best answer their individual research question lies with the investigator, armed with the objective prioritization that these techniques allow (Figure 1). 4.2.2. Technical Validation Having prioritized candidate DEGs for further investigation, initial investigations are needed to validate the transcriptomic findings at the technical level [ 90]. This can involve techniques to confirm sample purity, such as the qRT-PCR of genes that are known to be expressed (or not) in the sampled tissue. For example, in a sample of RGCs this involves checking that known RGC-specific genes (such as THY1 ) are expressed and those known to be specific to other, potentially contaminating, cell types (such as RHO from rods) are absent [ 36,44,45]. In addition, confirming that proteins relating to candidate genes are present in target tissues (for example, by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, or similar) is a helpful approach to relate findings at the transcriptomic to the effector (protein) level if the appropriate a priori knowledge is available.Genes  ,12, 147 8 of 15 Table 1.

Functional Validation When investigating potential disease mechanisms in optic neuropathies, the validation of the functional role of DEGs is paramount. Do changes identified at the transcriptomic level result in an alteration in cellular function relative to disease progression which could represent a therapeutic target? As direct access to retinal and optic nerve tissues fromGenes  ,12, 147 9 of 15 patients with inherited optic neuropathies is not practical, such work has relied heavily on preclinical models. These have been established from patient-derived cells (blood cells, fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, and cybrid cell lines) which allow the faithful replication of some cellular disease processes found in mutation-carrying cells, but outside of the RGCs themselves (extensively reviewed elsewhere [ 10]). Over the last decade, technological advances have allowed the generation of RGC cell lines [ 9] engineered from patient fibroblasts (via induced pluripotent stem cell technology) and animal disease models [ 7] that faithfully replicate the environment of the RGC in the diseased human retina (reviewed in ). Within model systems, the overexpression or inhibition of candidate genes can be fruitful approaches to validation. In the context of a promising therapeutic target, the manipulation of levels of gene expression in the model should lead to in changes in the metrics of the disease process (as in [ 59]). For an inherited optic neuropathy, the parameters can be anatomical, such as the rate of RGC survival, or relate to a known pathological process contributing to disease (e.g., mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or reactive oxygen species turnover ). The increasing variety and sophistication of in vitro and in vivo disease models for inherited optic neuropathies offer differing advantages that could be effectively harnessed in future transcriptomic studies to form a hierarchical validation pathway. For example, a large number of prioritized DEGs could be screened in relatively inexpensive and efficient traditional cell lines. Promising candidates from this work could then be investigated in more complex iPSC-RGC models to identify a small number of candidates for validation in animal models with a view towards translation. Furthermore, by using clinically demonstrated vectors (such as the adeno-associated virus [ 92]) candidate genes could be manipulated in vivo , with the advantage of being able to investigate meaningful effects at an organism levelfor example, by quantifying visual acuity [ 93] or electrophysiological measures . 4.3. Therapeutic Development 4.3.1. Personalized Medicine The clinical application of transcriptomic techniques has increased our ability to provide a confirmed molecular diagnosis to patients with a suspected inherited optic neuropathy. In recent years, this has become particularly important as gene replacement therapies have advanced to human clinical trials, as in LHON [ 94,95]. Clinical transcriptomics are already in use to personalize therapy regimes in areas such as oncology [ 96], and its future application to inherited optic neuropathies represents an exciting development in the field. 4.3.2. Transferable Neuroprotective Strategies Transcriptomics has the great potential to identify targets for generalizable , mutationindependent neuroprotective strategies for inherited optic neuropathies. These paradigms of mitochondrial disease can provide a platform from which to identify and develop novel therapeutics for other ocular and neurodegenerative diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated. This is particularly timely, given not only the ongoing maturation of models with which to functionally validate transcriptomic findings in optic neuropathy, but also the concurrent explosion in innovative ocular gene therapy approaches and viral vector delivery [ 9799]. Such techniques which are already licensed for clinical use in other conditions could be used to quickly develop therapies based on in vitro work to directly manipulate the intended therapeutic targets [ 92]. For example, gene replacement therapy has been successfully used to express wild-type copies of genes with homozygous null or haploinsufficient heterozygous pathogenic variants in vivo [92,100,101], with similar techniques also used to express neuroprotective genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in animal models [ 98]. Additionally, techniques to downregulate genes with a dominant negative effect have also been developed and successfully applied to various inherited retinal disorders [102105].Genes  ,12, 147 10 of 15 One of the reasons that in vivo ocular gene therapy has been so successful is the accessibility of the target cells, with RGCs being the first cell type encountered by therapeutic agents injected intravitreally (be it a viral vector, small molecule compound [ 106], or other biologic therapy [ 97,107,108]). Clearly, the extrapolation of potential neuroprotective strategies from an ocular model to more generalized central nervous system disorders will pose additional challenges. Here, direct access to tissue will not be as straightforward and much larger vector doses may be required, with an increased risk of adverse off-target effects , which will require close monitoring. 5. Conclusions In this review, we have critically appraised how powerful transcriptomic techniques have the potential to facilitate the diagnosis of patients with inherited optic neuropathies and, crucially, achieve a better understanding of the pathological processes that contribute to RGC loss. The insight gained can then be exploited to develop targeted therapies to enhance RGC survival, which could have much broader relevance for other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by disturbed mitochondrial function. Presently, an unprecedented confluent maturation of complementary techniques is occurring in single-cell transcriptomics, bioinformatics, relevant disease models, and clinically translatable effector techniques. The potential for therapeutic advances in the eye, and beyond, is an exciting proposition for the coming decade.
